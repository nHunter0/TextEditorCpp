Welcome to the NLP workbook This is the most comprehensive guide to NeuroLinguistic Programming available It has all the main material to practitioner level as well as many exercises suggestions and resources that go further It is called a workbook because it is practical it works you can change yourself and your world with the ideas and techniques here It is not a workbook in the sense of hard work NLP is remarkably easy intuitive and entertaining NLP is about your experience how you know the world and everyone in it how you do what you do how you create your own reality with its heights and depths I hope this book will tell you how to see hear and feel more of the world to know yourself better and to understand others more clearly If you already have some knowledge of NLP then this book will be an invaluable resource to integrate what you know give you some new ideas and some new exercises This book started life as the manual for my NLP practitioner course I have rearranged changed added subtracted and transformed that manual to make it into this book In doing so I hope I have kept most of the clarity and conciseness of the original The book is arranged in several sections each covering a topic in depth and the final section explains how it all fits together and what techniques and ideas to use in what situation NLP can be rather like a magic toolbox Marvelling at the wonderful things inside you ask yourself Where can I use this This book will answer that question There is also a final section on how to create your own tools so you can add to the box yourself How to Use This Book NLP is like a hologram you can start anywhere and build the whole picture so you can dip into this book at random and read what interests you If you read it through in INTRODUCTION order though I believe you will get a better looking easier to understand hologram If you are a trainer you will find many ideas in this book for NLP training You will also find many ideas you can adapt for any kind of communication or selfdevelopment skills training At the end of each section there is an Action Plan with practical exercises and suggestions for building your skills and making the ideas reality Knowledge as they say remains only a rumour until you embody it and do something with it These are exercises for everyday life They are not a regimented formula they dont have to be completed before you can read the next page and I would be kidding myself if I expected everyone to do them all They are suggestions Take the ones that you like and that work for you You may want to use this book more creatively for example like the Chinese divination book the I Ching When you have a problem and would appreciate some advice open the book at random and read a page How might it apply There is bound to be some application as both the problem and the meaning you take from what you read come from the same place your mind Above all be curious This book is about the endlessly fascinating webs of our experience Some days are wonderful We can do no wrong and neither can anyone else Other days are awful Everyone seems to conspire to thwart us and we can do nothing right If we tried to fall over the odds are we would miss the floor How does this all happen NLP can begin to tell you how and even a little of why Then perhaps you can make your way through each day with a little more choice a little less burdened by the excess baggage of old limitations x THE NLP WORKBOOK First things firstWhat is NLP But this is a trick questionYou cannot pin NLP down to a single definitionThere are many explanations of NLP each like a beam of light shining from a different angle picking out the whole shape and shadow of the subject NLP studies brilliance and quality how outstanding individuals and organizations get their outstanding results The methods can be taught to others so they too can get the same class of results This process is called modelling In order to model NLP studies how we structure our subjective experience how we think about our values and beliefs and how we create our emotional states and how we construct our internal world from our experience and give it meaning No event has meaning in itself we give it meaning and different people may give the same event different meanings So NLP studies experience from the inside NLP began by studying the best communicators and has evolved into the systemic study of human communication It has grown by adding practical tools and methods generated by modelling exceptional people These tools are used internationally in sports business training sales law and education However NLP is more than just a collection of techniques It is also a way of thinking a frame of mind based on curiosity exploration and fun The name NeuroLinguistic Programming comes from the three areas it brings together N Neurology The mind and how we think L Linguistics How we use language and how it affects us P Programming How we sequence our actions to achieve our goals WHAT IS NLP CHAPTER Here are some definitions of NLP Put them all together and they give a good idea of the field NLP is the study of the structure of subjective experience NLP is an accelerated learning strategy for the detection and utilization of patterns in the world John Grinder NLP is the epistemology of returning to what we have lost a state of grace John Grinder NLP is whatever works Robert Dilts NLP is an attitude and a methodology which leave behind a trail of techniques Richard Bandler NLP is the influence of language on our mind and subsequent behaviour NLP is the systemic study of human communication Alix Von Uhde NLP is the method for modelling excellence so it can be duplicated And now for two stories always a richer source of ideas than a straight definition A boy asked his mother Whats NLP His mother said I will tell you in a moment but first you have to do something so you can understand See your granddad over there in his chair Yep said the boy Go and ask him how his arthritis is today The boy went over to his grandfather Granddad he said hows your arthritis today Oh its a bit bad son replied the old man Its always worse in damp weather I can hardly move my fingers today A look of pain crossed his face The boy went back to his mother He said it was bad I think it hurts him Are you going to tell me what NLP is now In a minute I promise replied his mother Now go over and ask Granddad what was the funniest thing that you did when you were very young The boy went over to his grandfather Granddad he began whats the funniest thing I ever did when I was very young The old mans face lit up Oh he smiled there were lots of things There was the time when you and your friend played Father Christmas and sprinkled talcum powder all over the bathroom pretending it was snow I laughed but I didnt have to clean it up He stared into the distance with a smile Then there was the time I took you out for a walk It was a lovely day and you were singing a nursery rhyme you had just learned Loudly A man went past and gave you a nasty look He thought you were being too noisy He asked me to tell you to be quiet You turned round and said to him If you dont like me singing you can go and boil your head And carried on even louder The old man chuckled 2 THE NLP WORKBOOK WHAT IS NLP The boy went back to his mother Did you hear what Granddad said he asked Yes his mother replied You changed how he felt with a few words Thats NLP A wise man rode into a desert village one evening as the sun was setting Dismounting from his camel he asked one of the villagers for a drink of water Of course said the villager and gave him a cup of water The traveller drank the whole cupful Thank you he said Can I help you at all before I travel on Yes said the young man We have a dispute in our family I am the youngest of three brothers Our father died recently God rest his soul and all he possessed was a small herd of camels Seventeen to be exact He decreed in his will that one half of the herd was to go to my oldest brother one third to the middle brother and one ninth to me But how can we divide a herd of 17 We do not want to chop up any camels they are worth far more alive Take me to your house said the sage When he entered the house he saw the other two brothers and the mans widow sitting around the fire arguing The youngest brother interrupted them and introduced the traveller Wait said the wise man I think I can help you Here I give you my camel as a gift Now you have 18 camels One half goes to the eldest thats nine camels One third goes to the middle son thats six camels And one ninth goes to my friend here the youngest son Thats two Thats only 17 altogether said the youngest son Yes By a happy coincidence the camel left over is the one I gave to you If you could possibly give it back to me I will continue on my journey And he did How is NLP like the eighteenth camel It could be that it is brought into the situation by a wise man solves the problem quickly and then disappears as if it had never been there THE PILLARS OF NLP NLP has six basic principles They are known as the pillars of NLP 1 You your emotional state and level of skill You are the most important part of any NLP interventionYou make NLP real by what you do Just as a tool can be used to create beautiful art or rubbish so NLP can be used well or badlyYour success depends on how resourceful and skilful you areThe more congruent you are the more successful you will be Congruence is when your goals beliefs and values align with your actions and words when you walk your talk and talk your walk 2 The presuppositions the principles of NLP The presuppositions of NLP are its guiding principles those ideas or beliefs that are presupposed that is taken for granted and acted upon 3 Rapport the quality of relationship Rapport is the quality of relationship that results in mutual trust and responsivenessYou gain rapport by understanding and respecting the way another person sees the world It is like speaking their language Rapport is essential for good communication If you have rapport others will feel acknowledged and immediately be more responsive It is possible to build rapport at many levels but all involve paying attention to and respecting the other person Rapport can be built instantly and rapport over time evolves into trust 4 Outcome knowing what you want A basic skill of NLP is being clear about what you want and being able to elicit from others what they want NLP is based around always thinking of outcomes in every situation so you are always acting in a purposeful wayAn outcome is what you want a task is what you do to achieve it Outcome thinking has basic three elements Know your present situation where you are now Know your desired situation where you want to be Plan your strategy how to get from one to the other using the resources you have or creating new ones 5 Feedback how will you know you are getting what you want Once you know what you want you have to pay attention to what you are getting so you know what to do nextWhat are you paying attention to Is your feedback both precise and accurate Most of the time this means paying keen attention to your senses looking at listening to and feeling what is actually happeningYour senses are the only way you have of getting direct feedbackYou have only your senses to make sense of the worldThe information you get from your senses lets you know whether you are on course for your goal 6 Flexibility if what you are doing is not working then do something else When you know what you want and you know what you are getting the more strategies you have to achieve your outcome the greater your chance of successThe more choices you have of emotional state communication style and perspective the better your results NLP encourages choice governed by purpose in a relationship of rapport and awareness 4 THE NLP WORKBOOK WHAT IS NLP THE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF NLP The 13 presuppositions are the central principles of NLP its guiding philosophy its beliefs These principles are not claimed to be true or universal You do not have to believe they are true They are called presuppositions because you presuppose them to be true and then act as if they were Basically they form a set of ethical principles for life 1 People respond to their experience not to reality itself We do not know what reality is Our senses beliefs and past experience give us a map of the world from which to operate but a map can never be completely accurate otherwise it would be the same as the ground it coversWe do not know the territory so for us the map is the territory Some maps are better than others for finding your way aroundWe navigate life like a ship through a dangerous area of sea as long as the map shows the main hazards we will be fineWhen maps are faulty we are in danger of running aground NLP is the art of changing these maps so we have greater freedom of action 2 Having a choice is better than not having a choice Always try to have a map that gives you the widest number of choicesAlways act to increase choiceThe more choices you have the freer you are and the more influence you have 3 People make the best choice they can at the time A person always makes the best choice they can given their map of the worldThe choice may be selfdefeating bizarre or evil but for them it seems the best way forward Give them a better choice and they will take it Even better give them a superior map with more choices on it 4 People work perfectly No one is wrong or brokenWe are all executing our strategies perfectly but the strategies may be poorly designed and ineffective Find out how you and others operate so a strategy can be changed to something more useful and desirable 5 All actions have a purpose Our actions are not random we are always trying to achieve something although we may not be aware of what that is 6 Every behaviour has a positive intention All our actions have at least one purpose to achieve something that we value and that benefits us NLP separates the intention behind an action from the action itselfA person is not their behaviourWhen a person has a better choice of behaviour that also achieves their positive intention they will take it 7 The unconscious mind balances the conscious it is not malicious The unconscious is everything that is not in consciousness at the present moment It contains all the resources we need to live in balance 6 THE NLP WORKBOOK 8 The meaning of the communication is not simply what you intend but also the response you get This response may be different from the one you wanted but there are no failures in communication only responses and feedback If you are not getting the result you want change what you are doingTake responsibility for the communication 9 We already have all the resources we need or we can create them There are no unresourceful people only unresourceful states of mind 10 Mind and body form a systemThey are different expressions of the one person Mind and body interact and influence each other It is not possible to make a change in one without the other being affectedWhen we think differently our bodies change When we act differently we change our thoughts and feelings 11 We process all information through our senses Developing your senses so they become more acute gives you better information and helps you think more clearly 12 Modelling successful performance leads to excellence If one person can do something it is possible to model it and teach it to others In this way everyone can learn to get better results in their own wayYou do not become a clone of the person you are modelling you learn from them 13 If you want to understand act The learning is in the doing WHAT DOES NLP DO NLP brings about selfdevelopment and change First you use it to work on yourself to become the person you really want to be and can be Also you work on yourself so that you can effectively help others I do a lot of air travel and at the beginning of every flight when you have sat down and put your seat belt on the staff have you at their mercy and they go through the safety procedures At this point the frequent fliers bury themselves in the inflight magazine because they have heard it all before and some of them could recite it by heart But I always remember one thing about those safety procedures if the cabin loses pressure oxygen masks drop down and you should put them on before helping anyone else Why Because if you dont put your own mask on you could pass out and then you are no good to anyone yourself or another person Selfdevelopment is the equivalent to putting your own mask on first The more you know about yourself the more you are able to help others NLP is not about fixing other people and neglecting yourself Put your own mask on first WHAT IS NLP When you approach change and selfdevelopment you need to be congruent in other words you need to be determined to succeed and believe in what you are doing Congruence means that you are committed to making the change so that you do not sabotage yourself Secondly you need to establish rapport in other words work within a relationship of trust and mutual influence Thirdly you need to establish what you want to achieve in that change Then you can apply one of the many patterns techniques or combinations of patterns that NLP has developed for change and learning Your result must be ecological so it fits into the wider picture without any unfortunate consequences for yourself or others Lastly you future pace that is you mentally rehearse the new change and learning This reinforces it and means that you will remember to act differently when the time comes to test what you have learned ECOLOGY Ecology is a concern for the overall system An ecology check is when you consider how the change you are making fits into the wider system You check that what looks like a good change in one part of a system does not cause problems in other areas Many personal and organizational changes fail because the system boundary is drawn too narrowly and the sideeffects turn out to be major headaches An ecology check is like checking a drug for bad sideeffects even if it cures the illness As part of an NLP technique an ecology check ensures that NLP does not become manipulative that your actions do not lead to your gain and another persons loss You also check that the change another person makes harmonizes with the rest of their life and relationships An ecology check for yourself ensures that you do not manipulate yourself forcing yourself into some course of action that you will come to regret later or that will hurt another person badly All actions have consequences beyond their specific context Our lives are complex and a change will ripple out like a stone dropped into a still pool Some changes make stronger ripples than others Some ripples will wash away some may disturb the surface far more than you thought A few may even become tidal waves Internal Ecology An internal ecology check is when you check with your own feelings that a course of action would be a wise one to follow The ecology of your physical body is shown in your physical health Your mental ecology is shown by your feelings of congruence or incongruence Incongruence is the feeling that the change has consequences that are uncertain so you need more information or are negative so you need to think again Incongruence is not bad but you need to be aware of it and explore why you are feeling it For an internal ecology check the questions you need to ask are What are the wider consequences of my action What will I lose if I make this change What extra will I have to do Is it worth it What will I gain if I make this change What is the price of making this change and am I willing to pay it What are the good aspects of the present state How can I keep those good aspects while making the change I want Listen feel and look carefully for your answers A typical incongruent response will be an uneasy feeling usually in the stomach A visual incongruence is often a sense of the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle not making sense The classic incongruent phrase is Yes but Sometimes when you do an ecology check the unpleasant consequences may be very clear and you may need to rethink your outcome Other times you may get an intuition that all is not well without being able to say exactly why This intuition is an unconscious indication that the change is not completely ecological Always pay attention to your intuitions and feelings of incongruence External Ecology Internal ecology shades into external ecology because we are all part of a wider system of relationships Internal and external ecology are two different perspectives on the same system An external ecology check examines how your outcome will affect other significant people in your life Make a leap of the imagination and become them How will your change affect them Does it go against any of their values Does this matter How will they react Ecology checks are part of systemic thinking Optimizing one part of a system invariably leads to the whole system working less well than it did For example suppose a man 8 THE NLP WORKBOOK WHAT IS NLP decides to lose weight and get fit in a moment of madness on New Years Eve He takes up squash and goes to the gym three times a week thinking that the more he does the better it will be Because his body is unused to the effort he pulls a muscle and becomes tired and lethargic Then he cant exercise becomes depressed does even less and may end up even less active and even heavier than he was at the years end and with a bill for physiotherapy and a subscription to a gym that he has hardly used as well Ecology is important in organizations too A big sales push may result in a leap in sales that puts pressure on the manufacturers to meet the demand If they are unable to deliver this will lead to more dissatisfied customers a rise in customer complaints and a subsequent loss of business CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS MIND All change takes place first at the unconscious level Then we become aware of it NLP has a characteristic approach to the conscious and unconscious that is different from most other systems of psychology In NLP the conscious refers to everything that is in present moment awareness We can hold about seven separate pieces of information consciously at any time However a lot depends on how we organize the information A telephone number may consist of seven digits You can memorize that as seven digits but once you take it as a telephone number and remember it as one whole chunk then you can store seven or so telephone numbers in your shortterm memory The unconscious is used in NLP to indicate everything that is not conscious So the unconscious is a container for many different thoughts feelings emotions resources and possibilities that you are not paying attention to at any given time When you switch your attention they will become conscious Some beliefs and values remain unconscious but guide your life without you ever realizing how powerful they are Some parts of your physiology will always remain unconscious the carbon dioxide concentration in the blood how your heart beats what your liver is doing The more important and lifesustaining the function the more likely it is to be unconscious It would be very awkward if you had to remember consciously to make your heart beat regulate your digestion or make your bones regenerate The conscious mind is like the rider of a horse steering and guiding setting outcomes and deciding directions These then pass into the unconscious and we start to take actions to achieve them The unconscious is like the horse that actually does the work in getting to where the rider wants It is not a good idea to let the horse set the direction Nor is it a good idea for the rider to try to tell the horse exactly where to put its feet at every stage of the journey At best conscious and unconscious form a balanced partnership Everyone has all the resources they need to change or they can create them However people often think they do not have the resources because they are not conscious of them in the particular context where they need them But some neurophysiological research suggests that it is possible that every experience we ever have is stored somewhere and can be accessed under the right circumstances We have all had the experience of longforgotten events popping into our minds triggered by some stray thought and unconscious resources can be utilized by hypnotherapy and trance Some systems of psychology eg psychoanalysis view the unconscious as a repository of repressed disruptive material NLP considers the unconscious to be benevolent as it has all the experiences that we could use to gain wisdom NLP has a healthy respect for the unconscious The easiest place to start however is with the conscious what we are aware of and how we direct our lives formulating understanding and achieving our outcomes ACTION PLAN 1 Pick one of the NLP presuppositions that appeals to you Now think of a problem or difficult situation you have with another personWhat would you do if you were to act as if that presupposition were true How would the situation change As a simple example a friend of mine was part of a work project team One member of the team was driving him crazy by continually voicing objections getting into details too soon and wasting time in my friends opinionThe presupposition that came to mind was that people work perfectly His colleague had an excellent strategy for sorting and making sense of information but he was applying it in the wrong place Keeping the presupposition in mind helped my friend understand his colleague be patient with him keep rapport and help him to ask his questions in a different way at a different time when they were extremely valuable 2 Now pick the presupposition that you have the greatest doubts aboutTake another difficult situation in your lifeWhat would you do if you acted as if that presupposition were true How would the situation change 3 Watch the film The Matrix on video If you have already seen it watch it again If you were the protagonist in the film would you have taken the blue or the red pill And how do you know you are not in a Matrix for real 1 0 THE NLP WORKBOOK What do you want This is the definitive question in NLP An outcome is what you want a desired state something you dont have in your present state Outcomes come out when we achieve them hence the name and the first step towards achieving them is to think them through carefully Why you want your outcome and whether you should want it are questions that need an answer NLP outcomes are different from targets goals and objectives because they have been carefully considered and meet certain conditions that make them realistic motivating and achievable By setting an outcome we become aware of the difference between what we have and what we want This difference is the problem When you have set an outcome and are clear about your desired state then you can plan to make the journey from one to the other You become proactive take ownership of the problem and start to move towards a solution When you do not know what you want there are many people who are only too delighted to set you to work getting their outcomes An outcome is not the same as a task An outcome is what you want A task is what you have to do to achieve it Dont do tasks until you set your outcomes Problems cannot be solved unless you have an outcome Change is a journey from an unsatisfactory present state towards a desired state your outcome You use various resources to help you make the journey OUTCOMES CHAPTER There are four basic questions you need to ask to make this journey successfully What am I moving towards The desired state or outcome Why am I moving The values that guide you How will I get there The strategy for the journey What if something goes wrong Risk management and contingency planning THINKING IN OUTCOMES There are two aspects to outcomes Outcome thinking deciding what you want in a given situation Outcome orientation consistently thinking in outcomes and having a general direction and purpose in life Until you know what you want what you do will be aimless and your results will be random Outcome orientation gives you control over the direction in which you travelYou need it in your personal life and it is essential in business The opposite of outcome thinking is problem thinking Problem thinking focuses on what is wrong Our society is caught up in problem thinking We notice what is wrong and the next step is allocating blame as if bad things only happen because people make them happen deliberately This seems especially true in politics Many people get lost in a labyrinth of problems finding out their history cost and consequences asking questions like Whats wrong How long has it gone on for 1 2 THE NLP WORKBOOK Present state Where you are but prefer not to be Desired state Where you want to be Resources Mental strategies language physiology emotional states beliefs and values NLP basic change When did it start Whose fault is it Why havent you solved it yet These questions focus on the past or present They are also guaranteed to make you feel worse about the problem because they really push your nose in it Problems are difficult because the very act of thinking about them makes us feel bad and therefore less resourceful We do not think as clearly so it is harder to think of a solution Problem thinking makes the problem even harder to solve It is much more useful to think about problems in terms of contribution and ask What was the other persons contribution towards that problem What was my contribution towards the problem How did those contributions add up to the problem These questions lead us in a more useful direction what do we want instead and what are we going to do about it HOW TO STRUCTURE OUTCOMES There are nine questions you need to ask when working with outcomes These are known as the wellformed conditions When you have thought them through then your outcome will be realistic achievable and motivating These conditions apply best to individual outcomes 1 Positive What do you want Outcomes are expressed in the positiveThis is nothing to do with positive thinking or positive in the sense of being good for you Positive here means directed towards something you want rather than away from something you wish to avoid So askWhat do I want notWhat do I not want or want to avoid For example losing weight and giving up smoking are negative outcomes which may partly explain why they are hard to achieve Reducing waste reducing fixed costs and losing fewer key staff are also negative outcomes How do you turn a negative into a positive outcome By askingWhat do I want instead and What will this do for me OUTCOMES 1 For example if you want to reduce your debt you can set the outcome to improve your cash flow 2 Evidence How will you know you are succeedinghave succeeded It is important to know you are on track for your outcomeYou need the right feedback in the right quantity and it needs to be accurateWhen you set an outcome you must think how you will measure the progress and with what degree of precision There are two kinds of evidence 1 Feedback as you progress towards the outcome How will you know you are on track 2 Evidence for having achieved the outcome How will you know that you have got it Ask How will I know that I am on course towards my outcome What am I going to measure How will I know when I have achieved this outcome What will I see hear or feel 3 Specifics Where when and with whom Where do you want the outcome Where specifically There may be places and situations where you do not want itYou may want to increase productivity but only in certain departmentsYou may want to buy a house but not if interest rates rise beyond a certain point When do you want it You may need to meet a deadline or you may not want the outcome before a specific date because other elements would not be in place to take advantage of itAsk Where specifically do I want this When specifically do I want this In what context do I want this 4 Resources What resources do you have List your resourcesThey will fall into five categories some more relevant than others depending on your outcome Objects Examples would be office equipment buildings and technologyThere may be books you can read television and video programmes you can see tapes you can listen to People For example family friends acquaintances your business colleagues other business contacts Role models Do you know anyone who has already succeeded in getting the outcome Whom can you talk to Has someone written about their experience Personal qualitiesWhat qualities do you have or need to develop to achieve the outcome Think of all your personal skills and capabilities Money Do you have enough Can you raise enough 5 Control Can you start and maintain this outcome How much is under your direct control What can you do and what do others have to do to get this outcome Who will help you How can you motivate them to actually want to help you rather than feeling they have to help you Ask 1 4 THE NLP WORKBOOK What can I do directly to get this outcome How can I persuade others to help me What can I offer them that will make them want to help 6 Ecology What are the wider consequences Here are some wider systemic questions to consider What time and effort will this outcome need Everything has an opportunity cost Spending time and effort on one thing leaves others neglected Who else is affected and how will they feel Take different perspectives In your business life consider your boss your customers your suppliers and the people you manage In your personal life consider your spouse your friends and your children When you think about the ecology of the outcome you may want to change it or think of a different way to get it What will you have to give up when you achieve this outcome It is said that you can have anything you want if you are prepared to pay for it and not necessarily in money What is good about the present situation What do you want to keep Losing valuable aspects of the present situation is the greatest cause of resistance to change both for individuals and organizations What else could happen when you get your outcome There are always secondary consequences and sometimes these become more of a problem than the initial situation King Midass golden touch comes to mind 7 Identity Is this outcome in keeping with who you are You can apply this at both the individual and organizational level First the individual level Suppose you want to manage a project Being involved with this project might mean a great deal of time away from home It might mean dropping other projects It might take you away from your main career pathAlthough you would like to be involved on balance it just does not suit youYou might askWhat does working on this project accomplish for me If the answer is to gain valuable experience then there may be other projects or training and consulting might be preferable The same is true at the organizational level Each company has a certain culture and a set of core values that define its identity Company outcomes need to be aligned with this corporate self Many companies come unstuck through diversifying into areas in which they are inexperienced and which do not fit their identity Many a company has a strong identity that is characteristic of its founder and this can work to its advantage Richard Branson of Virgin started an airline which was very different from his original music business but he and Virgin are identified with innovation so the move was profitable 8 How do your outcomes fit together How do you eat an elephant One bite at a time If the outcome is too large list all the obstacles that prevent you from getting it and set smaller outcomes to get over these barriersAskWhat prevents me from achieving this outcome OUTCOMES 1 When you are knee deep in crocodiles its hard to remember you went in to drain the swamp When the outcome is too small to be motivating and you feel bogged down with details ask yourselfWhat does this small outcome get for me Connect the details to the larger more motivating outcome of which it is part 9 Action plan What to do next Once you have put your plan through these questions then you are ready to act or perhaps delegateWhen delegating in a business project give your people the wider picture so they can connect their tasks with the larger project Make sure they know how to think outcomes through for themselvesThis will ensure that their tasks are aligned with yours Remember the story of the two builders Both were asked what they were doingThe first saidIm laying bricks The second saidIm building a wonderful building Guess which builder was more motivated and worked better HUGGS Some outcomes are more important than others I like to call the most important ones HUGGs Huge Unbelievably Great Goals Not all the outcome conditions apply to HUGGs They are largescale outcomes and cannot be specified exactly HUGGs have the following qualities They are long term 530 years They are clear compelling and easy to grasp They connect with your identity and core values You feel strongly about themThey engage your emotions you feel good when you think about them When you first set them they seem impossibleAs time goes on they start to manifest more and more They do not involve you sacrificing the present moment for a possible future however good HUGGs can shape your life Because they are long term and aligned with your core values you will often achieve them in unpredictable even paradoxical ways or they will almost seem to fall into your life like magic HUGGs often have an away from element If you do not achieve them it hurts This makes them more motivating They often have an edge to them too like a deadline or set of conditions For example one friend of mine left his job to start a company 1 6 THE NLP WORKBOOK of his own He gave himself five years to make it a success If it did not work out he would find another job in his old profession The most powerful HUGGs often involve removing elements from your life Sometimes the biggest leverage comes not from doing things to achieve them but from stopping doing things that are in your way Examples of HUGGs become a published author establish your own successful company start a charitable foundation move to another country win a gold medal at the Olympic Games become a millionaire HUGGs are creativeThey produce ongoing effects and they express your valuesYou create them they are personal you do not copy them from other people Keep track of your goals and review them regularly Reward yourself when you get them and enjoy those times They are what you have worked for and you deserve them Enjoy the achievement and enjoy the journey Collect those moments like beautiful pictures for a photograph album or press cuttings in a scrapbook Go back to them Use them to motivate yourself in the future Let them be a source of inspiration learning and pleasure Never be in a position to think Ive worked hard to get where I am Where am I BELIEFS Beliefs are the rules we live by They are our best guesses at reality and form our mental models the principles of how the world seems to work based on our experience Beliefs are not facts although we often mistake them for facts We have beliefs about other people about ourselves and about our relationships about what is possible and about what we are capable of We have a personal investment in our beliefs I told you so is a satisfying phrase because it means our beliefs were proved right It gives us confidence in our ideas Some things are not influenced by our belief in them the law of gravity for example will not change whether we believe in it or not Sometimes we treat other beliefs about our relationships abilities and possibilities as if they were as fixed and as immutable as gravity and they are not Beliefs actively shape our social world OUTCOMES 1 Beliefs act as selffulfilling prophecies They act as permissions as well as blocks to what we can do If you believe you are not very likeable it will make you act towards others in a way that may put them off and so confirm your belief even though you do not want it to be true If you believe you are likeable then you will approach people more openly and they are more likely to confirm your belief NLP treats beliefs as presuppositions not as truth or facts Beliefs create our social world Treating beliefs as presuppositions means NLP treats beliefs as principles of conduct You act as if they are true and if you like the results then you continue to act as if they are true If your beliefs do not bring good results you change them You have choice about what you believe though the belief that beliefs are changeable is in itself a challenging belief to many people Beliefs have to be acted on if they are to mean anything therefore beliefs are principles of action not empty ideals Beliefs and Outcomes You need to believe three things about your outcomes It is possible to achieve them You are able to achieve them You deserve to achieve them Possibility Ability and Worthiness are the three keys to achievement Remember them as the PAW Process Possibility Very often we mistake possibility for competence We think something is not possible when really we do not know how to do it We all have physical limits of course we are human not superheroes But we do not usually know what these limits are You cannot know what they are until you reach them You cannot prove a negative therefore you can never prove that you are incapable of anything you can only say that you have not achieved it yet Once it was considered impossible for any human being to run a mile in less than four minutes until Roger Bannister did it at Oxford on 6 May 1954 Then a strange thing happened more and more athletes started running a mile in under four minutes Today Roger Bannisters impossible achievement is commonplace 1 8 THE NLP WORKBOOK Do not be too quick to decide what is impossible Ability Have you put a mental ceiling on your achievements We often sell ourselves short by not believing we can do something But beliefs are not facts they are just our best guess about how things are at the moment Have one basic true belief You have not yet reached the limit of what you are capable Keep an open mind Do not ever announce to other people that you cant do something even if you think you cant Listen for a day or two and you will hear a string of admissions from people about what they cannot do People will own up much more readily to what they are bad at than to what they are good at Some people mistake this for modesty but it is not Modesty means not bragging about what you can do Dont boast about your supposed limitations Negative talk just wraps you in a straitjacket of imposed limitations If you find yourself thinking like this add the little word yet to the end Then you are being realistic Dont make excuses in advance or plead extenuating circumstances out loud either If you make an excuse in advance then you are going to need it Take responsibility for your goals There may be any number of good reasons why you do not get them but if you make excuses in advance then you have set yourself up for failure Worthiness Do you deserve to achieve your goals Only you can answer this question but why not NLP does not judge whether goals are morally or ethically right it simply gives you a process to help you achieve them The ecology check will usually catch any moral or ethical dilemmas Only you can decide how to resolve these dilemmas After you have worked on your goals with the wellformed conditions put them through the PAW questions Say for each goal This goal is possible I have the ability to achieve this goal I deserve to achieve this goal Notice any uncomfortable feelings They will point to obstacles and selfdoubts OUTCOMES 1 Now look for possible obstacles What might stop you Think to yourself I will not achieve my goal because and then list all the possible reasons that come into your mind These obstacles usually fall into five categories 1 You dont have the resources people equipment time and place 2 You have the resources but you dont know what to do 3 You know what to do but you do not believe you have the skill 4 You have the skill but it doesnt seem worth it 5 It is worthwhile but somehow its just not you Once you have the list of objections decide how many of them are real obstacles and how many of them are your beliefs There are three possibilities 1 There are real obstacles that make it impossible for you to achieve your goals If this is so then just drop the outcome Its a waste of time to pursue it now although circumstances may change 2 They are real obstacles that you could get around if you devoted the time and effort to doing so 2 0 THE NLP WORKBOOK Its possible I can do it I deserve it Your dreams The keys to achievement If this is so then decide whether you want the goal enough to put in the time and effort If you do fine If you do not then drop the outcome 3 They are beliefs about yourself or other people and you do not really know whether they are true If this is so then think how you could test that belief Does the obstacle only exist inside your head How real is it Once you have tested it then it will fall into one of the first two categories This approach makes you responsible for your outcomes You decide Affirmations Affirmations can help you achieve your goals An affirmation is a pithy statement of your outcome that assumes that it is possible and achievable and keeps your mind focused on it Affirmations are like belief statements they can be powerful but they have to be carefully phrased When you make affirmations that are about selfdevelopment phrase them as if they are occurring now For example if your outcome is to become a more relaxed person a suitable affirmation might be I am becoming more and more relaxed I am feeling better and better about myself Do not phrase selfdevelopment affirmations as if they have already happened for example I am a more relaxed person I feel better about myself You are not yet and so your unconscious mind will whisper No youre not You arent fooling anybody Do not give selfdevelopment affirmations an exact deadline for example In three months time I shall be a more relaxed person First of all it may take more or less than three months Secondly your unconscious mind will whisper OK so we dont need to do anything right now then do we Affirmations should only have specific time and date if they are about specific actions for example On Monday 22 January I will go to the gym and exercise for one hour or By this time next year I will have doubled my salary Dont just think it ink it Write down your outcomes Write down your affirmations Write them on goodquality paper in your best handwriting and say them several times every day They will keep them in your mind and you will start to see opportunities that you would never see otherwise When you achieve them put them away safely under the heading of Success Stories and whenever you feel your confidence waning dig them out and enjoy the feeling of achievement again OUTCOMES 2 ACTION PLAN 1 Sit down and write at least 10 outcomes that you want to achieve in the next week 2 Write down your outcomes every six months Have at least two in each of the following groups professional life personal health relationships money selfdevelopment spiritual life List each one in as much detail as you wish Keep this list where you can refer to it At the end of six months look over it and renew it for the next six months replacing those outcomes that you have achieved with new ones Write them out carefully or do them on a word processor Your unconscious mind will not put any value on poorly written goals on a scrappy piece of paper So write them out as if they are very importantThey are Do them as if they could change your lifeThey will 3 Write down three HUGGs 4 Watch the film The Shawshank Redemption on video even if you have seen it beforeWhat was the key resource for the character played by Tim Robbins when he was in prison 5 Listen for the times when you sell yourself short boast about your failures or tell other people that you cant do somethingThey might believe it Do you During the course of one day count how many times you hear other people trying to convince you that they are incapable of something Do you believe them This is the first in a series of four articles Across all disciplines at all levels and throughout the world health care is becoming more complex Just 30 years ago the typical general practitioner in the United Kingdom practised from privately owned premises with a minimum of support staff subscribed to a single journal phoned up a specialist whenever he or she needed advice and did around an hours paperwork per week The specialist worked in a hospital focused explicitly on a particular system of the body was undisputed leader of his or her firm and generally left administration to the administrators These individuals often worked long hours but most of their problems could be described in biomedical terms and tackled using the knowledge and skills they had acquired at medical school You used to go to the doctor when you felt ill to find out what was wrong with you and get some medicine that would make you better These days you are as likely to be there because the doctor or the nurse the care coordinator or even the computer has sent for you Your treatment will now be dictated by the evidencebut this may well be imprecise equivocal or conflicting Your declared values and preferences may be used formally or informally in a shared management decision about your illness The solution to your problem is unlikely to come in a bottle and may well involve a multidisciplinary team Not so long ago public health was the science of controlling infectious diseases by identifying the cause an alien organism and taking steps to remove or contain it Todays epidemics have fuzzier boundaries one is even known as syndrome X1 they are the result of the interplay of genetic predisposition environmental context and lifestyle choices Just why it should have happened or why it should have happened just when it did he could not of course possibly have said nor perhaps would it even have occurred to him to ask The thing was above all a secret something to be preciously concealed from Mother and Father and to that very fact it owed an enormous part of its deliciousness It was like a peculiarly beautiful trinket to be carried unmentioned in ones trouserpocketa rare stamp an old coin a few tiny gold links found trodden out of shape on the path in the park a pebble of carnelian a sea shell distinguishable from all others by an unusual spot or stripeand as if it were any one of these he carried around with him everywhere a warm and persistent and increasingly beautiful sense of possession Nor was it only a sense of possessionit was also a sense of protection It was as if in some delightful way his secret gave him a fortress a wall behind which he could retreat into heavenly seclusion This was almost the first thing he had noticed about it apart from the oddness of the thing itselfand it was this that now again for the fiftieth time occurred to him as he sat in the little schoolroom ft was the half hour for geography Miss Buell was revolving with one finger slowly a huge terrestrial globe which had been placed on her desk The green and yellow continents passed and repassed questions were asked and answered and now the little girl in front of him Deirdre who had a funny little constellation of freckles on the back of her neck exactly like the Big Dipper was standing up and telling Miss Buell that the equator was the line that ran round the middle Miss Buells face which was old and greyish and kindly with grey stiff curls beside the cheeks and eyes that swam very brightly like little minnows behind thick glasses wrinkled itself into a complication of amusements Ah I see The earth is wearing a belt or a sash Or someone drew a line round it Oh nonot thatI mean In the general laughter he did not share or only a very little He was thinking about the Arctic and Antarctic regions which of course on the globe were white Miss Buell was now telling them about the tropics the jungles the steamy heat of equatorial swamps where the birds and butterflies and even the snakes were like living jewels As he listened to these things he was already with a pleasant sense of halfeffort putting his secret between himself and the words Was it really an effort at all For effort implied something voluntary and perhaps even something one did not especially want whereas this was distinctly pleasant and came almost of its own accord All he needed to do was to think of that morning the first one and then of all the others But it was all so absurdly simple It had amounted to so little It was nothing just an ideaand just why it should have become so wonderful so permanent was a mystery a very pleasant one to be sure but also in an amusing way foolish However without ceasing to listen to Miss Buell who had now moved up to the north temperate zones he deliberately invited his memory of the first morning It was only a moment or two after he had waked upor perhaps the moment itself But was there to be exact an exact moment Was one awake all at once or was it gradual Anyway it was after he had stretched a lazy hand up towards the headrail and yawned and then relaxed again among his warm covers all the more grateful on a December morning that the thing had happened Suddenly for no reason he had thought of the postman he remembered the postman Perhaps there was nothing so odd in that After all he heard the postman almost every morning in his life his heavy boots could be heard clumping round the corner at the top of the little cobbled hillstreet and then progressively nearer progressively louder the double knock at each door the crossings and recrossings of the street till finally the clumsy steps came stumbling across to the very door and the tremendous knock came which shook the house itself Miss Buell was saying Vast wheatgrowing areas in North America and Siberia Deirdre had for the moment placed her left hand across the back of her neck But on this particular morning the first morning as he lay there with his eyes closed he had for some reason waited for the postman He wanted to hear him come round the corner And that was precisely the jokehe never did He never came He never had comeround the corneragain For when at last the steps were heard they had already he was quite sure come a little down the hill to the first house and even so the steps were curiously differentthey were softer they had a new secrecy about them they were muffled and indistinct and while the rhythm of them was the same it now said a new thingit said peace it said remoteness it said cold it said sleep And he had understood the situation at oncenothing could have seemed simplerthere had been snow in the night such as all winter he had been longing for and it was this which had rendered the postmans first footsteps inaudible and the later ones faint Of course How lovely And even now it must be snowingit was going to be a snowy daythe long white ragged lines were drifting and sifting across the street across the faces of the old houses whispering and hushing making little triangles of white in the corners between cobblestones seething a little when the wind blew them over the ground to a drifted corner and so it would be all day getting deeper and deeper and silenter and silenter Miss Buell was saying Land of perpetual snow All this time of course while he lay in bed he had kept his eyes closed listening to the nearer progress of the postman the muffled footsteps thumping and slipping on the snowsheathed cobbles and all the other soundsthe double knocks a frosty faroff voice or two a bell ringing thinly and softly as if under a sheet of icehad the same slightly abstracted quality as if removed by one degree from actualityas if everything in the world had been insulated by snow But when at last pleased he opened his eyes and turned them towards the window to see for himself this longdesired and now so clearly imagined miraclewhat he saw instead was brilliant sunlight on a roof and when astonished he jumped out of bed and stared down into the street expecting to see the cobbles obliterated by the snow he saw nothing but the bare bright cobbles themselves Queer the effect this extraordinary surprise had had upon himall the following morning he had kept with him a sense as of snow falling about him a secret screen of new snow between himself and the world If he had not dreamed such a thingand how could he have dreamed it while awake how else could one explain it In any case the delusion had been so vivid as to affect his entire behaviour He could not now remember whether it was on the first or the second morningor was it even the thirdthat his mother had drawn attention to some oddness in his manner But my darling she had said at the breakfast table what has come over you You dont seem to be listening And how often that very thing had happened since Miss Buell was now asking if anyone knew the difference between the North Pole and the Magnetic Pole Deirdre was holding up her flickering brown hand and he could see the four white dimples that marked the knuckles Perhaps it hadnt been either the second or third morningor even the fourth or fifth How could he be sure How could he be sure just when the delicious progress had become clear Just when it had really begun The intervals werent very precise All he now knew was that at some point or otherperhaps the second day perhaps the sixthhe had noticed that the presence of the snow was a little more insistent the sound of it clearer and conversely the sound of the postmans footsteps more indistinct Not only could he not hear the steps come round the corner he could not even hear them at the first house It was below the first house that he heard them and then a few days later it was below the second house that he heard them and a few days later again below the third Gradually gradually the snow was becoming heavier the sound of its seething louder the cobblestones more and more muffled When he found each morning on going to the window after the ritual of listening that the roofs and cobbles were as bare as ever it made no difference This was after all only what he had expected It was even what pleased him what rewarded him the thing was his own belonged to no one else No one else knew about it not even his mother and father There outside were the bare cobbles and here inside was the snow Snow growing heavier each day muffling the world hiding the ugly and deadening increasingly above allthe steps of the postman But my darling she had said at the luncheon table what has come over you You dont seem to listen when people speak to you Thats the third time Ive asked you to pass your plate How was one to explain this to Mother or to Father There was of course nothing to be done about it nothing All one could do was to laugh embarrasscdly pretend to be a little ashamed apologize and take a sudden and somewhat disingenuous interest in what was being done or said The cat had stayed out all night Lie had a curious swelling on his left cheekperhaps somebody had kicked him or a stone had struck him Mrs Kempton was or was not coming to tea The house was going to be house cleaned or turned out on Wednesday instead of Friday A new lamp was provided for his evening workperhaps it was eyestrain which accounted for this new and so peculiar vagueness of hisMother was looking at him with amusement as she said this but with something else as well A new lamp Anew lamp Yes Mother No Mother Yes Mother School is going very well The geometry is very easy The history is very dull The geography is very interestingparticularly when it takes one to the North Pole Why the North Pole Oh well it would be fun to be an explorer Another Peary or Scott or Shackleton And then abruptly he found his interest in the talk at an end stared at the pudding on his plate listened waited and began once moreah how heavenly too the first beginningsto hear or feelfor could he actually hear itthe silent snow the secret snow Miss Buell was telling them about the search for the Northwest Passage about Hendrik Hudson the Half Moon This had been indeed the only distressing feature of the new experience the fact that it so increasingly had brought him into a kind of mute misunderstanding or even conflict with his father and mother It was as if he were trying to lead a double life On the one hand he had to be Paul Hasleman and keep up the appearance of being that person dress wash and answer intelligently when spoken to on the other he had to explore this new world which had been opened to him Nor could there be the slightest doubtnot the slightestthat the new world was the profounder and more wonderful of the two It was irresistible It was miraculous Its beauty was simply beyond anything beyond speech as beyond thoughtutterly incommunicable But how then between the two worlds of which he was thus constantly aware was he to keep a balance One must get up one must go to breakfast one must talk with Mother go to school do ones lessonsand in all this try not to appear too much of a fool But if all the while one was also trying to extract the full deliciousness of another and quite separate existence one which could not easily if at all be spoken of how was one to manage How was one to explain Would it be safe to explain Would it be absurd Would it merely mean that he would get into some obscure kind of trouble These thoughts came and went came and went as softly and secretly as the snow they were not precisely a disturbance perhaps they were even a pleasure he liked to have them their presence was something almost palpable something he could stroke with his hand without closing his eyes and without ceasing to see Miss Buell and the schoolroom and the globe and the freckles on Deirdres neck nevertheless he did in a sense cease to see or to see the obvious external world and substituted for this vision the vision of snow the sound of snow and the slow almost soundless approach of the postman Yesterday it had been only at the sixth house that the postman had become audible the snow was much deeper now it was falling more swiftly and heavily the sound of its seething was more distinct more soothing more persistent And this morning it had been as nearly as he could figurejust above the seventh house perhaps only a step or two above at most he had heard two or three footsteps before the knock had sounded And with each such narrowing of the sphere each nearer approach of the limit at which the postman was first audible it was odd how sharply was increased the amount of illusion which had to be carried into the ordinary business of daily life Each day it was harder to get out of bed to go to the window to look out at theas alwaysperfectly empty and snowless street Each day it was more difficult to go through the perfunctory motions of greeting Mother and Father at breakfast to reply to their questions to put his books together and go to school And at school how extraordinarily hard to conduct with success simultaneously the public life and the life that was secret There were times when he longedpositively achedto tell everyone about itto burst out with itonly to be checked almost at once by a faroff feeling as of some faint absurdity which was inherent in it but was it absurdand more importantly by a sense of mysterious power in his very secrecy Yes it must be kept secret That more and more became clear At whatever cost to himself whatever pain to others Miss Buell looked straight at him smiling and said Perhaps well ask Paul Im sure Paul will come out of his daydream long enough to be able to tell us Wont you Paul He rose slowly from his chair resting one hand on the brightly varnished desk and deliberately stared through the snow towards the blackboard It was an effort but it was amusing to make it Yes he said slowly it was what we now call the Hudson River This he thought to be the Northwest Passage He was disappointed He sat down again and as he did so Deirdre half turned in her chair and gave him a shy smile of approval and admiration At whatever pain to others This part of it was very puzzling very puzzling Mother was very nice and so was Father Yes that was all true enough He wanted to be nice to them to tell them everythingand yet was it really wrong of him to want to have a secret place of his own At bedtime the night before Mother had said If this goes on my lad well have to see a doctor we will We cant have our boy But what was it she had said Live in another world Live so far away The word far had been in it he was sure and then Mother had taken up a magazine again and laughed a little but with an expression which wasnt mirthful He had felt sorry for her The bell rang for dismissal The sound came to him through long curved parallels of falling snow He saw Deirdre rise and had himself risen almost as soonbut not quite as soonas she II On the walk homeward which was timeless it pleased him to see through the accompaniment or counterpoint of snow the items of mere externality on his way There were many kinds of brick in the sidewalks and laid in many kinds of pattern The garden walls too were various some of wooden palings some of plaster some of stone Twigs of bushes leaned over the walls the little hard green winterbuds of lilac on grey stems sheathed and fat other branches very thin and fine and black and dessicated Dirty sparrows huddled in the bushes as dull in colour as dead fruit left in leafless trees A single starling creaked on a weather vane In the gutter beside a drain was a scrap of torn and dirty newspaper caught in a little delta of filth the word ECZEMA appeared in large capitals and below it was a letter from Mrs Amelia D Cravath 2100 Pine Street Fort Worth Texas to the effect that after being a sufferer for years she had been cured by Caleys Ointment In the little delta beside the fanshaped and deeply runnelled continent of brown mud were lost twigs descended from their parent trees dead matches a rusty horsechestnut burr a small concentration of sparkling gravel on the lip of the sewer a fragment of eggshell a streak of yellow sawdust which had been wet and now was dry and congealed a brown pebble and a broken feather Further on was a cement sidewalk ruled into geometrical parallelograms with a brass inlay at one end commemorating the contractors who had laid it and halfway across an irregular and random series of dogtracks immortalized in synthetic stone He knew these well and always stepped on them to cover the little hollows with his own foot had always been a queer pleasure today he did it once more but perfunctorily and detachedly all the while thinking of something else That was a dog a long time ago who had made a mistake and walked on the cement while it was still wet He had probably wagged his tail but that hadnt been recorded Now Paul Hasleman aged twelve on his way home from school crossed the same river which in the meantime had frozen into rock Homeward through the snow the snow falling in bright sunshine Homeward Then came the gateway with the two posts surmounted by eggshaped stones which had been cunningly balanced on their ends as if by Columbus and mortared in the very act of balance a source of perpetual wonder On the brick wall just beyond the letter H had been stenciled presumably for some purpose H H The green hydrant with a little greenpainted chain attached to the brass screwcap The elm tree with the great grey wound in the bark kidneyshaped into which he always put his handto feel the cold but living wood The injury he had been sure was due to the gnawings of a tethered horse But now it deserved only a passing palm a merely tolerant eye There were more important things Miracles Beyond the thoughts of trees mere elms Beyond the thoughts of sidewalks mere stone mere brick mere cement Beyond the thoughts even of his own shoes which trod these sidewalks obediently bearing a burden far above of elaborate mystery He watched them They were not very well polished he had neglected them for a very good reason they were one of the many parts of the increasing difficulty of the daily return to daily life the morning struggle To get up having at last opened ones eyes to go to the window and discover no snow to wash to dress to descend the curving stairs to breakfast At whatever pain to others nevertheless one must persevere in severance since the incommunicability of the experience demanded it It was desirable of course to be kind to Mother and Father especially as they seemed to be worried but it was also desirable to be resolute If they should decideas appeared likelyto consult the doctor Doctor Howells and have Paul inspected his heart listened to through a kind of dictaphone his lungs his stomachwell that was all right He would go through with it He would give them answer for question tooperhaps such answers as they hadnt expected No That would never do For the secret world must at all costs be preserved The birdhouse in the appletree was emptyit was the wrong time of year for wrens The little round black door had lost its pleasure The wrens were enjoying other houses other nests remoter trees But this too was a notion which he only vaguely and grazingly entertainedas if for the moment he merely touched an edge of it there was something further on which was already assuming a sharper importance something which already teased at the corners of his eyes teasing also at the corner of his mind It was funny to think that he so wanted this so awaited itand yet found himself enjoying this momentary dalliance with the birdhouse as if for a quite deliberate postponement and enhancement of the approaching pleasure He was aware of his delay of his smiling and detached and now almost uncomprehending gaze at the little birdhouse he knew what he was going to look at next it was his own little cobbled hillstreet his own house the little river at the bottom of the hill the grocers shop with the cardboard man in the window and now thinking of all this he turned his head still smiling and looking quickly right and left through the snowladen sunlight And the mist of snow as he had foreseen was still on it a ghost of snow falling in the bright sunlight softly and steadily floating and turning and pausing soundlessly meeting the snow that covered as with a transparent mirage the bare bright cobbles He loved ithe stood still and loved it Its beauty was paralyzingbeyond all words all experience all dream No fairystory he had ever read could be compared with itnone had ever given him this extraordinary combination of ethereal loveliness with a something else unnameable which was just faintly and deliciously terrifying What was this thing As he thought of it he looked upward toward his own bedroom window which was openand it was as if he looked straight into the room and saw himself lying half awake in his bed There he wasat this very instant he was still perhaps actually theremore truly there than standing here at the edge of the cobbled hillstreet with one hand lifted to shade his eyes against the snowsun Had he indeed ever left his room in all this time since that very first morning Was the whole progress still being enacted there was it still the same morning and himself not yet wholly awake And even now had the postman not yet come round the corner This idea amused him and automatically as he thought of it he turned his head and looked toward the top of the hill There was of course nothing therenothing and no one The street was empty and quiet And all the more because of its emptiness it occurred to him to count the houses a thing which oddly enough he hadnt before thought of doing Of course he had known there werent manymany that is on his own side of the street which were the ones that figured in the postmans progressbut nevertheless it came to him as something of a shock to find that there were precisely six above his own househis own house was the seventh Six Astonished he looked at his own houselooked at the door on which was the number thirteenand then realized that the whole thing was exactly and logically and absurdly what he ought to have known Just the same the realization gave him abruptly and even a little frighteningly a sense of hurry He was being hurriedhe was being rushed Forhe knit his browshe couldnt be mistakenit was just above the seventh house his own house that the postman had first been audible this very morning But in that casein that casedid it mean that tomorrow he would hear nothing The knock he had heard must have been the knock of their own door Did it meanand this was an idea which gave him a really extraordinary feeling of surprisethat he would never hear the postman again that tomorrow morning the postman would already have passed the house in a snow by then so deep as to render his footsteps completely inaudible That he would have made his approach down the snowfilled street so soundlessly so secretly that he Paul Hasleman there lying in bed would not have waked in time or waking would have heard nothing But how could that be Unless even the knocker should be muffled in the snowfrozen tight perhaps But in that case A vague feeling of disappointment came over him a vague sadness as if he felt himself deprived of something which he had long looked forward to something much prized After all this all this beautiful progress the slow delicious advance of the postman through the silent and secret snow the knock creeping closer each day and the footsteps nearer the audible compass of the world thus daily narrowed narrowed narrowed as the snow soothingly and beautifully encroached and deepened after all this was he to be defrauded of the one thing he had so wantedto be able to count as it were the last two or three solemn footsteps as they finally approached his own door Was it all going to happen at the end so suddenly or indeed had it already happened with no slow and subtle gradations of menace in which he could luxuriate He gazed upward again toward his own window which flashed in the sun and this time almost with a feeling that it would be better if he were still in bed in that room for in that case this must still be the first morning and there would be six more mornings to comeor for that matter seven or eight or ninehow could he be sureor even more III After supper the inquisition began He stood before the doctor under the lamp and submitted silently to the usual thumpings and tappings Now will you please say Ah An Now again please if you dont mind An Say it slowly and hold it if you can Ahhhhhh Good How silly all this was As if it had anything to do with his throat Or his heart or lungs Relaxing his mouth of which the corners after all this absurd stretching felt uncomfortable he avoided the doctors eyes and stared towards the fireplace past his mothers feet in grey slippers which projected from the green chair and his fathers feet in brown slippers which stood neatly side by side on the hearth rug Hm There is certainly nothing wrong there He felt the doctors eyes fixed upon him and as if merely to be polite returned the look but with a feeling of justifiable evasiveness Now young man tell medo you feel all right Yes sir quite all right No headaches no dizziness No I dont think so Let me see Lets get a book if you dont mindyes thank you that will do splendidlyand now Paul if youll just read it holding it as you would normally hold it He took the book and read And another praise have I to tell for this the city our mother the gift of a great god a glory of the land most high the might of horses the might of young horses the might of the sea For thou son of Cronus our lord Poseidon hast throned herein this pride since in these roads first thou didst show forth the curb that cures the rage of steeds And the shapely oar apt to mens hands hath a wondrous speed on the brine following the hundredfooted Nereids O land that art praised above all lands now is it for thee to make those bright praises seen in deeds He stopped tentatively and lowered the heavy book Noas I thoughtthere is certainly no superficial sign of eyestrain Silence thronged the room and he was aware of the focused scrutiny of the three people who confronted him We could have his eyes examinedbut I believe it is something else What could it be This was his fathers voice Its only this curious absentmindedness This was his mothers voice In the presence of the doctor they both seemed irritatingly apologetic I believe it is something else Now PaulI would like very much to ask you a question or two You will answer them wont youyou know Im an old old friend of yours eh Thats right His back was thumped twice by the doctors fat fist then the doctor was grinning at him with false amiability while with one fingernail he was scratching the top button of his waistcoat Beyond the doctors shoulder was the fire the fingers of flame making light prestidigitation against the sooty fireback the soft sound of their random flutter the only sound I would like to knowis there anything that worries you The doctor was again smiling his eyelids low against the little black pupils in each of which was a tiny white bead of light Why answer him why answer him at all At whatever pain to othersbut it was all a nuisance this necessity for resistance this necessity for attention it was as if one had been stood up on a brilliantly lighted stage under a great round blaze of spotlight as if one were merely a trained seal or a performing dog or a fish dipped out of an aquarium and held up by the tail It would serve them right if he were merely to bark or growl And meanwhile to miss these last few precious hours these hours of which each minute was more beautiful than the last more menacing He still looked as if from a great distance at the beads of light in the doctors eyes at the fixed false smile and then beyond once more at his mothers slippers his fathers slippers the soft flutter of the fire Even here even amongst these hostile presences and in this arranged light he could see the snow he could hear itit was in the corners of the room where the shadow was deepest under the sofa behind the halfopened door which led to the diningroom It was gentler here softer its seethe the quietest of whispers as if in deference to a drawingroom it had quite deliberately put on its manners it kept itself out of sight obliterated itself but distinctly with an air of saying Ah but just wait Wait till we are alone together Then I will begin to tell you something new Something white something cold something sleepy something of cease and peace and the long bright curve of space Tell them to go away Banish them Refuse to speak Leave them go upstairs to your room turn out the light and get into bedI will go with you I will be waiting for you I will tell you a better story than Little Kay of the Skates or The Snow GhostI will surround your bed I will close the windows pile a deep drift against the door so that none will ever again be able to enter Speak to them It seemed as if the little hissing voice came from a slow white spiral of falling flakes in the corner by the front window but he could not be sure He felt himself smiling then and said to the doctor but without looking at him looking beyond him still Oh no I think not But are you sure my boy His fathers voice came softly and coldly thenthe familiar voice of silken warning You neednt answer at once Paulremember were trying to help youthink it over and be quite sure wont you He felt himself smiling again at the notion of being quite sure What a joke As if he werent so sure that reassurance was no longer necessary and all this crossexamination a ridiculous farce a grotesque parody What could they know about it these gross intelligences these humdrum minds so bound to the usual the ordinary Impossible to tell them about it Why even now even now with the proof so abundant so formidable so imminent so appallingly present here in this very room could they believe itcould even his mother believe it Noit was only too plain that if anything were said about it the merest hint given they would be incredulousthey would laughthey would say Absurdthink things about him which werent true Why no Im not worriedwhy should I be He looked then straight at the doctors lowlidded eyes looked from one of them to the other from one bead of light to the other and gave a little laugh The doctor seemed to be disconcerted by this He drew back in his chair resting a fat white hand on either knee The smile faded slowly from his face Well Paul he said and paused gravely Im afraid you dont take this quite seriously enough I think you perhaps dont quite realizedont quite realize He took a deep quick breath and turned as if helplessly at a loss for words to the others But Mother and Father were both silentno help was forthcoming You must surely know be aware that you have not been quite yourself of late dont you know that It was amusing to watch the doctors renewed attempt at a smile a queer disorganized look as of confidential embarrassment I feel all right sir he said and again gave the little laugh And were trying to help you The doctors tone sharpened Yes sir I know But why Im all right Im just thinking thats all His mother made a quick movement forward resting a hand on the back of the doctors chair Thinking she said But my dear about what This was a direct challengeand would have to be directly met But before he met it he looked again into the corner by the door as if for reassurance He smiled again at what he saw at what he heard The little spiral was still there still softly whirling like the ghost of a white kitten chasing the ghost of a white tail and making as it did so the faintest of whispers It was all right If only he could remain firm everything was going to be all right Oh about anything about nothingyou know the way you do You meandaydreaming Oh nothinking But thinking about what Anything He laughed a third timebut this time happening to glance upward towards his mothers face he was appalled at the effect his laughter seemed to have upon her Her mouth had opened in an expression of horror This was too bad Unfortunate He had known it would cause pain of coursebut he hadnt expected it to be quite so bad as this Perhaps perhaps if he just gave them a tiny gleaming hint About the snow he said What on earth 1 This was his fathers voice The brown slippers came a step nearer on the hearthrug But my dear what do you mean This was his mothers voice The doctor merely stared Just snow thats all I like to think about it Tell us about it my boy But thats all it is Theres nothing to tell You know what snow is This he said almost angrily for he felt that they were trying to corner him He turned sideways so as no longer to face the doctor and the better to see the inch of blackness between the windowsill and the lowered curtainthe cold inch of beckoning and delicious night At once he felt better more assured Mothercan I go to bed now please Ive got a headache But I thought you said Its just come Its all these questions Can I mother You can go as soon as the doctor has finished Dont you think this thing ought to be gone into thoroughly and now This was Fathers voice The brown slippers again came a step nearer the voice was the wellknown punishment voice resonant and cruel Oh whats the use Norman Quite suddenly everyone was silent And without precisely facing them nevertheless he was aware that all three of them were watching him with an extraordinary intensity staring hard at himas if he had done something monstrous or was himself some kind of monster He could hear the soft irregular flutter of the flames the cluckclickcluckclick of the clock far and faint two sudden spurts of laughter from the kitchen as quickly cut off as begun a murmur of water in the pipes and then the silence seemed to deepen to spread out to become worldlong and worldwide to become timeless and shapeless and to center inevitably and rightly with a slow and sleepy but enormous concentration of all power on the beginning of a new sound What this new sound was going to be he knew perfectly well It might begin with a hiss but it would end with a roarthere was no time to losehe must escape It mustnt happen here Without another word he turned and ran up the stairs Not a moment too soon The darkness was coming in long white waves A prolonged sibilance filled the night a great seamless seethe of wild influence went abruptly across ita cold low humming shook the windows He shut the door and flung off his clothes in the dark The bare black floor was like a little raft tossed in waves of snow almost overwhelmed washed under whitely up again smothered in curled billows of feather The snow was laughing it spoke from all sides at once it pressed closer to him as he ran and jumped exulting into his bed Listen to us it said Listen We have come to tell you the story we told you about You remember Lie down Shut your eyes nowyou will no longer see much in this white darkness who could see or want to see We will take the place of everything Listen A beautiful varying dance of snow began at the front of the room came forward and then retreated flattened out toward the floor then rose fountainlike to the ceiling swayed recruited itself from a new stream of flakes which poured laughing in through the humming window advanced again lifted long white arms It said peace it said remoteness it said coldit said But then a gash of horrible light fell brutally across the room from the opening doorthe snow drew back hissing something alien had come into the roomsomething hostile This thing rushed at him clutched at him shook himand he was not merely horrified he was filled with such a loathing as he had never known What was this this cruel disturbance this act of anger and hate It was as if he had to reach up a hand toward another world for any understanding of itan effort of which he was only barely capable But of that other world he still remembered just enough to know the exorcising words They tore themselves from his other life suddenly Mother Mother Go away I hate you And with that effort everything was solved everything became all right the seamless hiss advanced once more the long white wavering lines rose and fell like enormous whispering seawaves the whisper becoming louder the laughter more numerous Listen 1 it said Well tell you the last the most beautiful and secret storyshut your eyesit is a very small story a story that gets smaller and smallerit comes inward instead of opening like a flowerit is a flower becoming a seeda little cold seeddo you hear we are leaning closer to you The hiss was now becoming a roarthe whole world was a vast moving screen of snowbut even now it said peace it said remoteness it said cold it said sleep Something you cannot tell about violins when you see one radiant in a museum cabinet or singing under the soloists touch is that they are held together by pure tension Many parts of the instrument are kept in place by nothing more than pressure and tightness If there are too many small imbalances it can pull itself to pieces When you put on new strings you have to replace them one by one not remove them all at once This is because if you did the pale chip of the bridge that supports them would fall off and the tiny post inside that is the backbone of the violins sound would drop out Each is held in place only by the strings wound so tightly they cinch the body parts closer together If you were even more cavalier and removed all of them every time the repeated tug and release might eventually buckle the whole thing The tuning pegs for the strings incidentally are not geared and easy to turn like on a guitar These too are held in place by a truce between tension and friction wooden pegs twisted into holes in wood tightly enough to withstand the pull of steel If they are old and worn tuning involves grasping and wrenching fingernails pressed pale against aged ebony It can be hard to know how much it will take before the truce snaps or splinters You usually have to negotiate these tensions before you play a note To persuade it into tune is always to be a little unsure Equally there can be hidden weaknesses in the construction caused by damage or poor workmanship or two and a half centuries of slowly desiccating animalhide glue The strength of the joints fails and the steelwrapped strings strain at the neck until it pops loose from the shoulders of the instrument When this happens the fingerboard is wrenched against the body with nowhere to go until it too snaps away Then the strings suddenly have nothing left to pull against and yank themselves slack The pegs spin loose and the bridge falls off and the soundpost drops out and then there is silence I open the violin case to find this dismantlement There is no splintering only dull edges as if it has never been more than pieces They are confident it is a straightforward repair Modern techniques will make it stronger than the luthier in the workshop could have imagined haphazard and fuddled by tallowsmoke and varnish fumes rushing to finish in time for the buyer to try out the latest Bach And really it wasnt even that fragile to begin with the glue was good for nearly three hundred years Thats a warranty of several lifetimes What they cannot say is when the tension lacing it together will no longer lash through my hands every time I pick it up I have never been quite devoted enough to perfect the art of coaxing out its full voice Treading the fine line between a weak quavering whine and a brash overconfident screech rarely comes naturally enough to feel like more than a clumsy game of chance My playing has always been unsure For a while after it is put back together its unchanged sound is a marvel and we are inseparable But gradually inexorably the uncertainty returns A small split inconsequential unrelated keeps cracking open no matter how many times they stick it back Brushing it with a fingertip I hear snapping wood the gunshot of broken strings My mind shivers it into pieces again and this time it is in my hands that it fails In my imagination the brittle joints shrivel into uselessness to be torn off by a stroke of the bow or a twist of the hand just enough to strain the bodys tension past endurance I never used to be alive to such fragility If anything I trusted in its resilience too much Once my carelessness let it be knocked off a pub table when the other musicians moved to refill their glasses The clatter cut through the genial fug like a whipcrack No harm was done and we carried on Now it is hard to stop checking every inch Its surface is a weathered landscape of varnish worn away of scratches and stitched scars from inexpert early repairs Any one of them could be the flaw where one day it shears apart What was once the venerable ageing of an antique now looks more like perishing To hold it is to be ever more unsure Another thing you cannot tell about violins when you see a gap along an edge or find one reduced to its component pieces is that they are designed to be equal to the tension The seam fails so that the springy resilient wood does not The joint breaks cleanly so that the reassembly is clean Eventually perhaps there will be no strength left in its body to stand any more repairs That time may be now or it may not I can advance only by negotiation note by questioning note When I pick it up it is as though every joint is straining its whole weight suspended from my hand around its neck Surely this will be the time when a twist too far or a grip too hard or a phrase too loud will crack it all apart Yet one time after another it is still intact when I lay it aside The uneasy truce draws out another tick another hour another day into its next century Again I make my uncertain requests for it to speak Once more it answers taut strings ringing through imperfectly preserved wood Skip to main content Share your short works of literature

local interstate He was permanently disabled as a result Just to pile on 1 week after his accident my wife of 19 yrs was diagnosed with youre gonna die in 6 months breast cancer Well that sucks I was very fortunate that I had made myself a good living at a great company working for people I loved and who loved me They allowed me to take all the time I needed to get my loved ones situated I assumed any and all responsibility for my wife and my brother It was the only thing to do One day early on after he gets home I come over he tells me that his vacuum cleaner is broken Hes a clean freak I tell him That sucks No it doesnt Well hes got me there Shit I go to WalMart head to the household appliance section Fuk There are literally 25 different vacuums on the shelf Fuk I got no time for this shit After carefully weighing the pros and cons of each specific model I make a decision I begin celebrating this one little positive thing thats happened for awhile Im high fiveing myself silently dancing in the aisle on my way to bin 34 thinking to myself the whole way I am fucking awesome In troubled times one needs small victories I get to bin 34 to retrieve my prizeEmptySHIT Gloom Despair and Hopelessness all hit me at the same time My knees begin to buckle as I slowly collapse to the floor My only thoughts are to curl up in a ball in total surrender This is not going to be pretty Before my first tears hit the ground I notice on the box in the next bin over in big purple letters against the batmanlike yellow exploding graphic screaming Now with Continuous Suction Action My path was clear if I was gonna spend good money on a vacuum cleaner I want one that sucks all the time It seemed silly to buy one that only sucked some of the time 21 years later that vacuum still sucks Upvote Downvote comments English short story writing English short story writing Hey all I have a short story writing exam next Monday that has to be about one of Robert Frosts poems I chose Nothing Gold Can Stay Feedback is appreciated A melodical series of chirps accompanied by the rustling of leaves in the wind is interrupted by a set of light yet firm footsteps that put the rhythm to rest An ethereal figure bathes in the rays of the gentle sunlight She dons a dress made of leaves her hair cascading like a string of vines on a log of wood The nature around her perks up as she walks as if beckoning her presence A small squeak interrupts the womans walk her bright green eyes drifting down to the grass below her A pair of beady brown eyes stare back belonging to a small bundle of white fluff that bumps into her incessantly The woman coos and coddles the small rabbit like a mother would do to her baby opting to sit down to enjoy the small creatures company The woman plays and laughs to her hearts content mere minutes passing as she does so But since when did this small baby rabbit grow so big It can no longer fit comfortably in her hands A shimmer of gold peaks from around her peripherals The woman lifts her gaze from the rabbit to her surroundings Gold Everything has turned gold No longer are the trees and the bushes a vibrant green hue they now adorn the colours of Autumn Ah Time is such a fleeting thing is it not the woman speaks to not one individual but millions The trees the grass the rabbit at her feet the bird and her children in that tree over there She speaks to all of them and on behalf of all of them for she is Gaia Mother Nature Unlike most Gaia is unaffected by time and will remain alive as long as nature is also alive Gaia knows that creatures of flesh and blood will perish in the face of time Gaia knows that this rabbit at her feet will eventually succumb to deaths embrace and yet she cannot help but be saddened by this Gaia kneels down and embraces the rabbit before her savouring the warmth its body provides before it runs cold To her days are mere seconds and months are mere minutes It is Autumn No longer is there a musical tune being sung by birds nor is there a cacophony of leaves swaying in the wind Everyone must be preparing for the Winter as should you little one Gaia gently bids the rabbit goodbye only for it to stomp its foot anchoring itself in place Gaia urges for the small animal to seek shelter seek food for the Winter Many minutes pass as Gaia argues with the angry fluffball beside her its shiny white coat blending into its surroundingswhat Gaia curbs their argument and looks around her to see the golden hue of the trees have been drowned out by a sea of white Winter is here A wave of flakes blows past her as if afraid that it will harm her porcelain skin The Winter cold does not bother her nor does the summer sun for they are all apart of nature However the same does not apply for creatures of flesh and blood such as the poor trembling rabbit at her feet Gaia makes a vain attempt to shield the defenceless creature from the icy winds that assault its fragile body only to pull herself away She cannot directly intervene Gaia looks on helplessly the winter winds feeling awfully cold all of a sudden Gaia can do nothing but watch as the rabbit trembles in the middle of a turbulent storm of snow The rabbit can no longer move the deathly cold immobilising it Gaias body feels cold yet her face feels warm Why Gaia feels fresh hot tears dribble down her cheeks obscured green eyes meeting a pair of hazy brown eyes The rabbit is now on its side curled into a pitiful ball of fluff Although Gaia cannot physically touch the rabbit she can feel it The slowing symphony of this little ones heartbeat A sharp sensation slices through Gaias heart cutting though it like butter Gaias lip quivers as she helplessly watches on as the fire inside of the rabbits body dwindles with each passing moment Life is like fire brimming with colour and blazing with intensity But all it takes is for a single blow the roaring of the icy winds intensifies before slamming into the frail rabbit on the ground to snuff it out A scream claws its way out of the depths of Gaias throat ripping itself free Gaia can feel it in her body and in her soul She is now permitted to touch the animal no the corpse before her Gaia coddles the sunken chest of her fallen child to her own coddling it once more now that its warmth has run cold Gaia sits there crying into the rabbits snowtainted fur which for the first time felt like hours A small squeak interrupts the womans mourning Gaia lifts her tearstained face from the rabbits fur only to be met with a pair of beady brown eyes Gaias heart leaps out of her chest as a tiny bundle of fluff jumps into her arms Gaia looks around the trees and bushes have returned to their original vibrant green a familiar melodic piece being sung into the open air Spring has finally arrived A smile graces Gaias face a fond look passing over the pile of bones at her feet as she picks up the baby rabbit in her lap This is life Gaia knows that life and death go hand in hand unable to exist without each other Gaia knows that life is fleeting and that she mustnt intervene nor be perturbed by its end But Gaia cant help but always think back to Autumn specifically every time that this cycle repeats The calm before the storm the gold before the white She wipes her eyes Gaia isnt sad because she knows that Nothing Gold Can Stay Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments My first short story Crucified on the Appian Way My first short story Crucified on the Appian Way The sun dipped low in the sky casting long shadows across the ancient cobblestones of the Appian Way I pedaled my bicycle with determination sweat beading on my brow as my legs pumped furiously The rhythmic clicking of the gears and the hum of the tires on the road provided a comforting soundtrack to the macabre thoughts that consumed me I couldnt help but ponder the horrors endured by those crucified in ancient Rome their agonized screams echoing through time Such suffering I whispered to myself feeling an odd kinship with these longdead souls My heart raced as images of their torment filled my mind each more gruesome than the last As I rounded a curve my eyes were drawn to a curious sight a wooden pole protruding from the earth accompanied by a sturdy beam lying nearby The scene looked eerily familiar as if it had been plucked from my darkest musings and placed before me like some twisted stage set Is this I muttered dismounting my bicycle and approaching the strange sight The ground was uneven beneath my feet and I stumbled slightly as I drew closer my curiosity piqued Hello I called out unsure if someone might be nearby The wind rustled through the trees providing no answer I glanced back at my bike then turned my gaze once more to the wooden structure It seemed almost alive as though it held within it the memories of countless souls who had suffered upon it Could this really be a cross I wondered aloud my voice shaking with a mixture of fear and fascination The thought sent a shudder down my spine and I hesitated for a moment before reaching out a trembling hand to touch the rough wood Who would leave something like this here I asked myself unable to tear my eyes away from the haunting symbol of pain and suffering The wind picked up stirring the leaves around me and sending an inexplicable chill through my body Perhaps its a sign I murmured my thoughts racing with the possibilities What could this sudden encounter with such a potent symbol mean Was I meant to discover this relic or was it merely a cruel trick played by fate As I stood there transfixed by the sight before me I couldnt help but feel a strange connection to the crucifixion victims of long ago Their anguish seemed to resonate within me their cries echoing in the depths of my heart And though I knew the path forward would be fraught with pain and sorrow I felt compelled to explore this dark chapter of history further drawn inexorably toward the shadows that lay beyond the light I felt the rough texture of the beam beneath my fingertips and the air around me seemed to grow heavier with each passing moment Unable to resist the strange allure that pulsed from this grisly relic I made a decision that would forever haunt me Maybe maybe if I could just feel it for myself I whispered trembling as I peeled off my clothes until I stood there in my white briefs The wind bit at my exposed skin but I hardly noticed the anticipation of what was to come consumed me entirely Slowly deliberately I laid myself down upon the wooden beam stretching my arms outward as if they were being pinned to the cross by unseen nails The rough wood dug into my back but I welcomed the discomfort eager to experience even a fraction of the pain suffered by those who had come before me Closing my eyes I surrendered myself to the darkness within allowing my thoughts to drift back through the centuries to a time of unimaginable suffering a time when men and women were nailed to crosses and left to die in agony all in the name of justice Forgive me I murmured not knowing to whom I spoke but feeling the weight of my actions nonetheless Forgive you for what A deep mocking voice shattered the silence and I bolted upright my heart pounding in my chest But before I could make sense of what was happening the world around me shifted and I found myself in a place beyond my wildest nightmares Gone were the verdant hills and ancient ruins of the Appian Way Instead I am stripped of my clothes wearing only a white loincloth stretched out on the wooden beam that suddenly felt all too real The air was thick with the stench of blood and sweat and the sounds of weeping and cries of anguish filled my ears Whwhere am I I stammered my voice barely audible above the cacophony of suffering that surrounded me As I struggled to comprehend what was happening the grim reality of my predicament began to sink in I had been transported to the Roman era and I was about to be crucified The tears that welled up in my eyes were not only for the agony I would soon face but also for the foolish curiosity that had led me to this terrible fate A cold sweat drenched my skin as I gazed upon the grim visage of the Roman soldier approaching me his eyes devoid of mercy My breaths came in shallow gasps each inhale laced with fear and despair A cacophony of thoughts raced through my mind none offering any solace By the gods this cant be happening I muttered to myself desperately searching for a way out of this nightmare Silence barked the soldier brandishing a whip that cracked through the air just inches from my face Please I dont belong here I pleaded but my words fell on deaf ears They had made up their minds I was to be crucified like the others who shared my cruel fate Enough The centurions voice carried a tone of finality silencing my protestations My heart pounded in my chest as I watched the soldiers approach the prisoner next to me He trembled in terror struggling to maintain what little dignity he had left Please have mercy the man cried out his voice breaking under the weight of his anguish Mercy is for the weak sneered the soldier driving a heavy iron nail through the mans wrist and into the beams unforgiving wood His screams tore through the air echoing in my ears and searing themselves into my memory As I stared into the eyes of the man being hoisted onto the post beside me his feet nailed to the wood I couldnt help but feel a crushing sense of fear The moans of the crucified tore through the air like a symphony of suffering their anguish palpable as I glanced to my other side Row upon row of crosses lined the Appian Way each bearing its own pitiful cargo men writhing in pain stripped of their clothes and dignity Help me please one man begged his voice barely audible above the cacophony of despair His body slick with sweat and blood shuddered with each labored breath I closed my eyes trying to shut out the horrifying scene but the images were seared into my mind Keep moving a Roman soldier barked shoving the prisoners in front of me down the road Their shoulders slumped beneath the weight of the beams they bore their naked bodies covered in cuts and bruises They stumbled forward eyes downcast resigned to their fate Cant go on a prisoner at the head of the line gasped collapsing under the burden of his cross The Roman soldiers laughed cruelly kicking him until he struggled back to his feet Get up you filth Or well nail you right here one of them roared spittle flying from his lips The sun glared down mercilessly casting long grotesque shadows of the crucified men across the dusty road The scent of blood mingled with sweat filling my nostrils as I contemplated my own impending fate My heart hammered in my chest a mixture of fear and morbid fascination coursing through me Hey you a gruff voice shouted yanking me back to the present moment A burly Roman soldier pointed his finger directly at me his eyes narrowed with malice Your turn one of the soldiers growled at me Any last words Please listen Im not supposed to be here I choked out between ragged breaths but my desperate plea only elicited cruel laughter Neither are any of them he replied gesturing at the other prisoners awaiting their fate I opened my mouth to protest but before the words could escape the back of the soldiers hand collided with my face sending my head sprawling to the side The taste of blood filled my mouth as I struggled to regain my bearings Thought you could just watch did you another soldier sneered towering over me Think again Please I stammered my voice barely audible This is all a mistake Save it for someone who cares the first soldier spat He leaned in closer his breath heavy with the stench of wine Youre going up there whether you like it or not Look at him tremble the second soldier mocked grabbing a fistful of my hair and yanking my head back Maybe hell wet himself before we even get started Laughter erupted from the other soldiers their cruel taunts cutting through me like a blade Pathetic one of them jeered Just like the rest of these scum Leave me alone I cried out my fragile resolve crumbling away under the weight of their relentless torment But my pleas only seemed to amuse them further feeding their sadistic delight Your suffering has only just begun the first soldier whispered into my ear his voice dripping with menace By the time were done with you youll be begging for death The cold steel of the spike pressed against my right wrist sending shivers through my body My heart hammered in my chest as I looked into the eyes of the Roman soldier who held it Please I whispered but he ignored me and raised a hammer above his head Our eyes locked for a brief moment and then the hammer fell The agonizing shriek that tore from my throat was gutwrenching as the merciless spike impaled my trembling wrist pinning it brutally to the unforgiving wooden beam The searing pain was beyond comprehension sending shockwaves through my entire body I could feel hot tears streaming down my face and sobs racked my trembling form as I struggled against the relentless grip of agony Shut up the soldier barked grabbing my left arm and holding it in place My breaths came in short ragged gasps and my vision blurred from the agony Stop I choked out my voice barely more than a whisper Please stop Save your breath scum another soldier sneered Youll need it The hammer descended again and I couldnt hold back the scream that tore from my throat as the second spike penetrated my left wrist The world around me seemed to dissolve into a haze of redhot pain and I struggled desperately to remain conscious Alright lift him up one of the soldiers commanded and I felt hands gripping my body With a sudden jolt the weight of the crossbeam was lifted off the ground connecting it to the perpendicular post Suspended between heaven and earth I dangled by my wrists the pain from the spikes threatening to overwhelm me completely A barbarous chill descended upon my body as the soldiers fastened my feet one atop the other to the unforgivingly rough wood The first strike of the hammer sent an electric current of searing agony through me a shockwave that seemed to echo up into my skull And as each subsequent blow rained down the pain intensified to a scorching inferno engulfing every inch of my being in unrelenting torment Look at him now someone jeered their laughter dancing cruelly around me Not so tough anymore is he Letmedown I managed to gasp each word a struggle But my tormentors showed no sign of mercy their faces twisted into expressions of cold callous amusement Get used to it one of them sneered Youll be here for a while As I hung there powerless and in agony the cruel laughter of the Roman soldiers echoing in my ears my mind raced with thoughts of despair and helplessness What had I done to deserve such a fate Was there truly no hope of escape from this nightmare The sun blazed mercilessly above me its rays searing my exposed skin as I hung from the cross My feet throbbed with unbearable pain their soles pierced by long cruel spikes that pinned me to the wood Each labored breath felt like an impossible battle against the weight of shame and suffering crushing my chest The coarse splinters of the wooden cross bit into my flesh each minute movement sending fresh waves of agony through my body Look at you now a Roman soldier sneered his face twisted with sadistic delight Begging for mercy wont save you I tried to ignore him focusing instead on the task of drawing air into my lungs My chest was so constricted that every inhalation felt like a Herculean effort Desperation clawed at my throat suffocating me further as I gasped weakly for breath Cant even speak I managed to choke out my voice barely audible amid the groans and cries of my fellow prisoners Ha the soldier barked amused by my pathetic display Dont waste your breath scum Youll need it As the minutes dragged on the pain in my wrists and feet intensified threatening to consume me entirely Yet somehow I clung to consciousness unwilling to surrender to the darkness that beckoned at the edges of my vision Please the man beside me whimpered his own suffering evident in his strained voice Have mercy Mercy another soldier roared his laughter harsh and mocking You expect mercy from us Youre nothing but filth beneath our boots Stay strong I urged myself silently desperately trying to block out the soldiers taunts Youve made it this far Dont give them the satisfaction But as the hours wore on my resolve began to waver The unrelenting pain combined with my increasingly desperate struggle for breath threatened to break me completely I was no longer certain I could endure this torment any longer Gods I prayed silently if youre listening give me the strength to survive this hell As I hung there suspended between heaven and earth I knew that I had reached a crossroads Would I allow my tormentors to triumph or would I find some way to persevere through the unimaginable agony Only time would tell The sun bore down on us relentless and unforgiving I squinted against its glare my vision blurred by the sweat that stung my eyes The grim tableau of crucified prisoners extended in both directions our collective suffering amplified by the stark nakedness that left us exposed to the elements and the jeering eyes of our captors Please a man to my left choked out his voice barely audible over the cacophony of groans and sobs that filled the air I beg you let me down The Roman soldiers sneer twists into a malicious grin as he towers over the writhing man at his feet His eyes are ice cold devoid of any empathy or mercy as they rake over the pitiful figure before him Ha Want down now do you He taunts relishing in the mans agony You should have thought twice before following that traitor Spartacus and daring to challenge the might of Rome My heart clenched with pity for the poor soul beside me but I had no words of comfort to offer Each breath was a battle my lungs straining against the constriction of my chest My thoughts were consumed by the agonizing pain that shot through every nerve fire licking at my flesh where the splinters of the cross dug into my skin Look at them squirm another soldier barked his laughter low and malicious Like worms on a hook Pathetic his comrade agreed spitting at our feet Nothing but filth Gods above I prayed silently my voice little more than a whisper in my own head Give me the strength to endure this or grant me the mercy of death A sudden gust of cold wind jolted me back to reality My eyes slowly opened and my vision cleared revealing that I was lying with my hands extended on top of a wooden beam Was it all just a dream I whispered my voice shaking My body trembled with the aftershocks of the ordeal sweat dripping down my brow Get a grip I muttered to myself pulling my clothes towards me As I dressed the vividness of what Id just experienced continued to haunt me each agonizing moment playing out in my minds eye The taste of blood and humiliation lingered in my mouth my wrists still throbbing as if they bore ghostly wounds Ridiculous I scoffed trying to brush away the lingering thoughts as I fastened my belt and stepped into my shoes It was only a dream Excuse me are you alright A passerby called out his concerned gaze fixating on my disheveled state I must have looked like a madman sprawled on the ground and drenched in sweat Uh yeah I stammered forcing a smile Just needed a moment to rest thats all The man appeared bewildered as he saw me lying on the ground my arms spread wide wearing nothing but white briefs I couldnt help but feel embarrassed and ashamed Okay then he replied hesitantly clearly not convinced Take care Thanks I managed giving him a weak nod before mounting my bicycle With a deep breath I pushed off pedaling hard to distance myself from the eerie site that had triggered my nightmare Or had it been something more As I cycled my thoughts churned relentlessly struggling to make sense of my ordeal Had I somehow tapped into the collective memory of those who had suffered such a brutal fate Or was my imagination simply running wild fueled by my morbid fascination with the past Does it even matter I asked myself my voice barely audible against the wind You lived through it whether in your mind or some strange twist of reality Either way I continued my determination rising like a phoenix from the ashes of despair I wont let this experience define me I will use it to fuel my understanding and empathy for those who have suffered and to remind myself that life is precious and fleeting Never again I vowed my eyes locked on the horizon as I pedaled faster and faster will I take life for granted Never again I whispered my voice carried away by the wind will I forget the lessons learned from the crucifixion Upvote Downvote comments The Incident at Gallows Hill The Incident at Gallows Hill The children of Salem visited Gallows Hill on a night when the moon was as thin and sharp as a barbers blade They were after a snip of hair where it was said witches held their magic Everyone knew Mary was a witch It was proven when her neck resisted the quick snap of the hangmans deadfall She writhed and trembled for nearly twenty minutes before her body hung lifeless Many witches hung in Salem that year but it was Charlie who eventually spoke up with the dare of taking a witchs lock And on a still autumn night they snuck away from their beds and into the woods Charlie leading with his mothers scissors and a small glass jar Charlies courage left him when he saw the silhouette hanging from the tall oak the figure swayed with its head cocked queerly to the right Fear weighed in his footsteps The thought of his mothers voice warm and loving called him back to the safety of his bed but she went silent as he felt burning stares of the children behind him They measured his courage in each frozen second the word coward echoing in his mind He put the scissors between his teeth and started to climb the oaks trunk An earthy rotlike smell greeted him as he inched his way onto the hanging branch Ahead was the rope the ghoulish figure hanging below He steadied himself above the corpse trying not to think of the head tilted at that awful angle of a hidden hags grin waiting for his hand to leave the branch A gust of wind howled through the leafs causing him to pause and hug against the rough bark For a moment he thought he saw the witchs head turn just a little He watched her carefully until the body again held still Steadying himself he gathered his courage and reached out shyly with the scissors Other children would later recount that they saw Mary reach up and grab Charlie in the moonlight but they fled in horror too quickly to be certain Charlies body was found the next morning at the foot of the tree His neck was broken An empty jar and a pair of scissors lay at his side No snip of hair was found Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments STATIC HORRORMYSTERY uGirik1234 avatar uGirik1234 STATIC HORRORMYSTERY NOTE MARKS A SCENE CHANGE The moon loomed overhead bathing the massive expanse of the forest with its light The scent of damp grass wafted through the air as fireflies sparkled in the darkness of the forest Kuntal Mondal the forest ranger silently made his way through the forest his eyes scanning the environment In one part of the pines and firs a small clearing could be seen Within the clearing stood a bunch of weathered tents They were marred with yellowish stains while the bonfire beside the tents danced with the breeze Kuntal squinted after noticing that many things were scattered around the clearing including clothes sticks beer cans and also a solitary walkie talkie He was frustrated with the whole thing Not only had these people illegally camped in the forest but they had also left a mess Kuntal took slow calculated steps towards the walkie talkie making sure he didnt make a sound He pocketed the walkie talkie hoping that someone could reply from the other end Is anyone there he said through the device eyeing the trees around him He could have sworn that he saw something there I repeat can anyone hear me Suddenly a Pit Pat echoed from the depths of the forest Pulling out his handgun Kuntal jerked himself towards the direction of the sound expecting someone to lunge out of the depths Sweat trickled from his forehead as he heard more Pit Pats in front of him He gasped as a strange figure materialized from the distance The creature towered over Kuntal its massive bulk casting a long ominous shadow across the clearing Its body was disproportionately large with thick muscular limbs that seemed capable of crushing anything in their path It crawled on all fours its limbs all twisted and contorted while its slimy skin filled the air with a horrid stench Its massive mouth opened revealing many protruding jagged teeth ready to engulf Kuntal He wasted no time before firing his handgun yelling loudly for help The creature was taken aback by the gunshots that pierced its body but it made no signs of retreat With no other choice he took out a flare lit it with blurring speed and held it up his hands trembling The creature stopped momentarily recognizing the heat of the flare but it continued towards Kuntal with a deafening highpitched scream Kuntal took a few steps back before throwing the flare directly into the creatures mouth In an instant the creatures screams filled the air as it scrambled helplessly all over the place Kuntal gasped as he saw the belly slowly expanding Kuntal did not want to experience the sight anymore He wheeled himself around before running fullspeed into the forest not heeding the pain in his hips He did not know where he was going but as long as he was out of that things reach it was alright As he ran through the forest avoiding bumping into trees he heard a deafening explosion from behind which was followed by sounds of many things dropping to the ground each impact making a gross slimy sound Kuntal looked behind him and gagged the creature had blown up into a thousand pieces its slimy remains scattered throughout the ground some even stuck on tree branches More slime oozed out of the scattered pieces filling the air with a stench akin to one of rotten eggs That thing exploded Kuntal said grossed out by the whole ordeal He was glad to be alive for he had only heard stories of other rangers encountering the beast but he had never faced it himself Kalikan Forest was known for stories regarding strange creatures like whatever Kuntal had faced But skeptics had never believed stuff like this always countering the tales by questioning the absence of carcasses photographic evidence and successful expeditions meant to find these creatures However Kuntal knew better as did the other rangers of the forest They were well aware that these creatures were intelligent capable of hiding themselves when necessary The lack of photographic evidence was mainly due to the fact that no one survived encounters to take pictures and even if they did they never returned to share them Furthermore if these skeptics denied the existence of these creatures then nothing could explain the cause of the many disappearances throughout the years Still Kuntal had only been here for a week so encountering something like that put him off quite a bit despite hearing the stories from other rangers Kuntal had run quite a long distance before he aligned himself with a trail a mud path leading to a watchtower in the distance It loomed over the forest casting a long shadow across it This was Tower Moonshine one of the three ranger towers in Kalikan forest and this one belonged to Kuntal He rushed to the watchtower brushing the sweat off his face before starting to climb the spiraling staircase that led to the viewing deck of the tower I have to warn the others he thought as he raced through the stairs his hips begging him to stop I should have never gone there alone When he had finally reached the top of the tower he took in deep breaths trying to cleanse the memory of what had just happened his heart pounding on his ribcage He took a brief rest letting his hip pain subside before he went into the interior turning the doorknob with his sweaty palms The ceiling lights cast its glow over the room illuminating it A small bed was tucked away in one of the corners while a large table was placed on another side On it lay a computer a large radio and a coffee machine while many crumpled sheets of paper lay scattered on the floor mingled with soda cans and water bottles Kuntal booted up the radio its static buzzing through the air Is anyone there This is Tower Moonshine come in he began with a shaky voice Is anyone there I got bad news This is Ranger Tower Riverine What is the problem Kuntal replied a voice through the static Kuntal let out a sigh glad that someone had responded Mike the camp I went to search it was empty Kuntal said recalling the strange sight And then this happened He proceeded to explain the whole encounter with the creature even recalling the memory caused him to tremble The other ranger calmly listened till he had finished Are you sure that you have not lost your mind Mike said his voice carrying the tone of worry rather than skepticism Kuntal answered rather angrily No and if you doubt me then I have wasted your time Kuntal was simply frustrated He feared that nobody would believe him but he had to try Look I do not doubt you Mike said sadly I was simply concerned Plus we already knew that stuff like this roams around the forest Now if what you say is true then we have to warn Pralay Did you bring any evidence of the fat boy It will be harder to convince the Pralay without it considering that hes new Fat boy Mike this is serious Kuntal said his anger rising And no I did not get any evidence However I did get a walkie talkie from the campsite Have you tried to get a reply from the other end I tried but thats when the thing stepped in Let me give it another shot Hold on Kuntal took out the walkie talkie and said If anyone can hear me please reply Come in can anyone hear me Shivers went down Kuntals spine as a shaky gravelly voice came from the talkie Hello Derek are you there What the hell happened Kuntal hesitated for a moment before saying This is not Derek we are the forest rangers Tell us where you are we saw your bonfire near the camp but no one was there Where is Derek How do we get to the den Just tell us where you are We will come and find you And what is this den If we knew where we were we would have got to the den already Screw you man We are gonna try to get back to camp Wait no Dont return to the camp Kuntal yelled desperately but the connection was cut leaving the room in silence except for the sound of the wind beating at the windows Well that did not go well Mike let out a audible sigh I am gonna warn Pralay Good night Kuntal Good night Kuntal said grimly putting his hands over his forehead He thought that he could have handled that conversation better Fear crept over him as he retired to sleep It had been a long day and despite all of the things that had happened he quickly broke into a deep slumber Dreams swirled in his mind dreams of a strange creature akin to the one he had seen before with the only difference being that the creature was smaller There were numerous of them looking towards him curiously Slowly they closed in around him leaving him no chance for escape He let out a scream as the creatures lunged at tearing him into pieces He scrambled around before suddenly he fell into the void Kuntal woke up realizing that he had fallen into the floor His heart was beating at a intense speed while his brain was still processing the meaning of the nightmare The sunlight crept in through the window grasping Kuntal with his warm hand Birds chirped noisily outside mingled with the gentle rustle of leaves The combined scent of grass and flowers filled his nostrils immediately easing his heart Nature was the only thing keeping him going in this strange forest The peace was shortlived however as the radio started to beep Kuntal rushed to turn it on filling the air with static This is Ranger Tower Moonshine what is it he said waiting expectantly but no answer came This is Ranger Tower Moonshine come in This is Ranger Tower Riverine Kuntal what is it You woke me up man No I did not broadcast the signal Mike Was it you Pralay No answer came Come in Ranger Tower Hillside are you there Pralay are you there Kuntal said once again receiving no answer If he does not pick up the radio I will slap him when I see him next time Hes probably sleeping Mike said laughing at Kuntals outburst Anyways did you get anything else out of the walkie talkie I slept early yesterday Kuntal said shivers going down his spine He did not want to recall the dream again But who was broadcasting to the radio I dunno it probably picked up some random frequency Before Kuntal could reply a shaky and gravelly voice spoke through the radio We have found the den Derek We stole the rangers stuff and it was enough for supplies and Martin helped us with it I hope you are hearing this Derek Please come to the den quickly its just beside the river we discussed about in camp I will leave you a map at this tower if you are lost The connection cut off before anyone could reply leaving Kuntal to be puzzled I have a really bad feeling about this There was a long pause Kuntal did not like this at all Not only were these people avoiding them they had also apparently stolen supplies from rangers Mike finally broke the silence and said We need to check on Pralay They said something about stealing stuff from rangers Meet me at Tower Hillside Later that evening Kuntal had reached Tower Hillside which was a couple of miles away from his tower There he met Mike standing near the staircase leading to the viewing deck He was looking up at the tower with a gun in his hand Kuntal took out his own gun before looking up at the tower The towers light came through the windows illuminating the surroundings slightly A bone chilling mist raced through the air making Kuntal shiver Something isnt right Mike said sniffing at the air Kuntal had not realized it before but a horrid smell wafted through the air resembling the stench of rotten eggs Come on Kuntal Stay behind me I dont want you to get hurt No I will lead Kuntal objected but Mike had already started ascending up the stairs With each step Kuntal grew increasingly alarmed tightening his grip on the gun When they finally reached the viewing deck Mike stopped Kuntal with his arm stretched out Stay there he said before taking slow deliberate steps towards the open door Shivers went down Mikes spine as he looked inside the room The bed cover was torn apart with cotton spilling from the pillowsYellowish stains marred the walls and the chair lay upturned one of its legs broken The tables usually equipped with radios and a computer were completely devoid of these things However a strange piece of paper lying on the floor caught his attention Kuntal You might wanna see this Kuntal gasped entered into the chaotic room and wanted to comment about it but Mike stopped him and handed him the piece of paper Kuntal furrowed his brows as he realized that it was a map of the forest with a particular point near the river marked with a red dot This must be the den that they were talking about said Kuntal stroking his chin but Mike was concerned about something else Where was Pralay Surely he did not let himself be captured by whoever ravaged the place Pralay must be in that den and so are the thieves he said to himself Should I really risk going there or just leave it to the authorities No Mike Kuntal replied shaking his head Bringing the authorities into this mess means bringing questions to us And we already know that they aint going to believe a single thing about my story Mike let out a deep sigh before stepping out onto the viewing deck Suddenly a small creature very similar to the one Kuntal had seen before popped out of the shadows lunging at Mike with terrifying force Mike got knocked over and he started to wrestle with the creature SHIT Kuntal cried aiming his gun at the scrambling creature It was too risky to shoot he could hurt Mike Hold still Mike The creature enlarged its mouth revealing the set of jagged teeth slime oozing out of its body Kuntals heart skipped a beat as he shot at the creature hoping that it would not hurt Mike The bullet found its mark piercing through the slimy body yet it seemed relatively unfazed only giving a glance towards Kuntal But in that very instant Mike used all his strength to lift the creature up and drop it onto the ground below How he managed to lift it up he did not know himself It exploded into many pieces on impact its slimy parts splattered all over the ground Kuntal let out sigh relieved to see Mike safe Mike snarled as he brushed off the oozy slime off his shirt This is a mess How did it even get up here he said eyeing the creatures decrepit corpse Are you hurt Kuntal asked not heeding Mikes question No dont worry about me Kuntal We have to find Pralay and see what these fools are up to We need to investigate that den It is our duty to save him No Kuntal said raising his voice Mike dont you see how dangerous this is It will be foolish to even try something like that Let them be I am going away from here I will be giving my resignation tomorrow morning After all we have been through Mike began clenching his jaw You decide to leave me here alone Why Are you not resigning too Mike Surely you understand how unsafe this is Yes Mike said glaring at him I understand how dangerous this is But it is our duty to save Pralay we cant just leave him out there We dont even know if hes alive Mike Kuntal cried He did not want to spend a day more in this forest after seeing all these attacks Lets just leave Mike Do you remember when we signed up and the employer said that the last rangers only lasted a week Whats to say that they met the same fate There was a short pause Mike stared at Kuntal lowering his brows I will go to the den Thats final Kuntal shook his head slowly As your friend I cant leave you here I will come but if we cant find Pralay then we go back immediately Then lets begin Mike said starting to descend down the steps The moon was shrouded by dark clouds thunder reverberating through the air Small drops of rain showered on the forest creating many puddles of water throughout the ground The rain created constant ripples on the river flowing beside the forest while frogs croaked loudly singing their song The rain splattered on Kuntals face brought by the chilly wind Mike was in front of him scaling through the environment and getting his feet stuck in the muddy ground Damn the rain he cried loudly receiving a angry shush from Kuntal As they got closer they could see a small opening on the side of a large rockface sticking out of the ground Kuntals heart fastened its pace as he saw drops of slime dripping from the top of the opening He wanted to turn back but kept going lead by Mikes undying fire of determination Mike entered the cave while Kuntal followed hesitantly As soon as he stepped inside his shoe got stuck in the slimy booze splattered on the floor He struggled to get it out eventually leading him to leave the shoe and carry on barefooted They cautiously moved past the slimy mess before they were greeted by the darkness Mike took out his flashlight and the the beam of light further into the cave Mike narrowed his brows as he the flashlight revealed a long tunnel with more slime stuck on the ceiling They barely fit into the tunnel making their way through it half bent Kuntal felt the wall closing in on him tight spaces were not kind to him His breath felt labored while his ears seemed to catch strange Pit Pat noises mingled with the Drip Drop of water As they made their way the tunnel got increasingly humid with sweat trickling from their faces their shirts more wet from their sweat than the shower of rain they had been through before If Pralay is here Kuntal thought He wont be alive Kollas looked back at the way he came from and felt a pull towards it yet he kept going Suddenly Mike stopped leading Kuntal to bump into him What is it Kuntal whispered his voice echoing through the air Why did you stop Mike turned back his eyes widened he held out the badge of Pralay the embossed copper gleaming under the flashlights influence He must be here somewhere whispered Mike pocketing the badge He proceeded to walk through the tunnel but Kuntal was hesitant Not only was the tunnel growing increasingly smaller it was also getting hotter Still he went on After what felt like hours of stumbling they finally reached the end Little did they know that the opening would lead them to the most sinister place imaginable Mike swiftly crawled out of the opening followed by Kuntal Kuntal panted for a while It had not been easy crawling through that tunnel But instead of inhaling fresh air a horrid stench greeted him instead Kuntal stumbled back as he saw what the flashlight illuminated Dozens no hundreds of spherical blobs were clustered throughout the cavern Slime hung on the ceiling in thin strands their nets supporting more clustered blobs Kuntal gasped as he noticed that the blobs housed tiny creatures which were a miniature version of the creatures they had encountered before Mike simply stood there frozen in place with his hand covering his mouth Beautiful isnt it a familiar voice said Kuntal and Mike took a few steps back noticing a young blondehaired lady her voice was the one they heard from the walkie talkie So Derek did not come It was a shame really Who are you Mike demanded his hands near the gun strap And what is all of this added Kuntal Oh this she said casually pointing to the clusters of blobs Why they are eggs of course Eggs You mean that this is the home to those damn creatures Kuntal said feeling frustrated himself And what hand do you have behind all of this Why did you come here I thought that was quite clear she said her voice musically toned I wanted to visit Derek and all of his friends So I set out with a couple of my friends to visit him Who is Derek Well that is what saddens me she said her smile turning into a frown You killed him Blew him up with that flare or atleast thats what his brothers say Mike and Kuntal stood there frozen in shock The silence intensified the sound of multiple splotchy footsteps reaching their ears Kuntals breath caught in his throat as he saw numerous of the small creatures surround them their fat slimy bodies glistening under the flashlights influence while their teeth shone brightly Nothis cant be Mike stuttered looking at all of the creatures What have you done to Pralay Oh Pralay You mean the ranger Well he was the payment for Dereks death Here he is The creatures brought out a twisted contorted body with its organs exposed blood spewing out of the body The blood mingled with the slime inflating strange blobs of slime their cells interchanging with each other to form clusters of blobs One death gives the rise to many lives the lady said smiling menacingly Kuntal gagged feeling his heart drum intensely while Mike broke into a run going back towards the tunnel opening but it was too late Mike was surrounded by the creatures as they circled around him with great pace slowly closing in Kuntal let out a horrified yell as the creatures extended their jaws tearing Mike apart in a thousand pieces Hundreds of blobs sprouted out of Mikes decrepit corpse as tears streamed down Kuntals cheek This is where your story ends ranger Youre just a pawn in a much bigger game Ive been tending to these creatures for years and theyll only get stronger Your role may be over but youll still serve my purpose Youll help me spread these mutated creatures far and wide Kuntal yelled desperately as the creatures closed in upon him bringing him to his demise And with his death his story remained unfinished with no echo of his memory remaining That was not everything The lady collapsed onto the floor her eyes widened Hundreds of the tiny creatures tore out of her body slime oozing out of her nostrils and ears More creatures came out of Mikes decrepit corpse The creatures met in the middle with them rhythmically speaking in a high pitched voice They spoke in their own language but I will tell you what they said You have done well the group that came out of the ladys body said to the other group that came out out of Mikes body What was the rangers name again Oh right Mike Yes Mike did well we controlled his mind just enough to bring the other ranger here Anyways once they hire the next ranger make sure to settle yourselves on one of their minds They proceeded to chant in a chorus their voiced echoing through the air THANKS FOR READING Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments The Mango The Mango There was once a man who was bet a million dollars to shove a mango up his ass It was said as a joke of course even within a room full of many others and barely ten minutes after it was said everyone in the room completely forgot about it But the man got home that night and he was laying in bed unable to sleep with a million dumb thoughts floating in his mind like a windmill And suddenly the dumbest thought of them all came back to mind Could he truly shove a mango up his ass he thought Is it even possible So despite the time being 11 pm he got out of bed and he found a single open bodega and there was a single mango left there yellow and ripe He thought it was quite magical and a coincidence of great meaning He went home and got down in the shower bending over on all fours and put lots of lube on the mango But the mango simply wouldnt fit up his ass So he rinsed the mango off in the shower water cut it up and started to eat it Waste not he thought Shortly afterward nibbling on the seed an idea struck him A seed he could easily fit up there So he shoved the seed up there and he went to sleep The next morning he bought some grow lights which were battery powered and also shoved them up his ass Soon afterwards a whole mango had grown right there inside of his ass A magical experience Growing something so complex and beautiful inside of himself He went up to that joker from the beginning of all this and pulled down his pants and directed the joker to stick his finger up inside of there Reticently he did He felt a mango up there And a million dollars was given to the man right that very moment Unfortunately for the man what couldnt go in also could not go out and he quickly developed a bowel obstruction requiring an emergent bowel operation That alone cost thousands of dollars in care and lost time But the problems he inherited from this operation cost him much moreexactly one million dollars over the course of his life So the man in the end came out with nothing but the experience of having a mango in his ass an experience of which he always looked back on and smiled which changed his philosophy and altered the course of his life And on his deathbed his last memory in this realm was about growing that mango inside of his ass and he left this Earth thinking his life was quite fruitful Upvote Downvote comments Short story Short story Can anyone help me with the formatting of the short story

missed his first two shots cursing under his breath but his third hit with a pink mist One of the glowing faces fell and went dark beneath the slow moving water The remaining silhouettes sped up

Fathers Before Me Seeking Feedback rHFY My Fathers Before Me good chance of onion ninjas I found the chest when I was seven playing in the house while my mother tended the family garden My father had left before sunrise as he did one day every year I never thought to ask where he went on that day school had just let out and summer was on its way in the adventures with my friends were more important to me Summer was short and school would return before we knew it Plastic sword in hand prepared to defend my ship I walked through the house looking for stowaways and found the treasure in my parents closet Gold coins attached to ribbons placed neatly in a wooden box with a silver necklace carrying an angel and another necklace bore my Fathers name on two plates between them a casing battered and dull My Fathers treasures were so great why hide them Resting underneath the wooden box was a green jacket folded neatly and proud a patch on the sleeve ringed in bright red and a thin border of white in the shape of the plates that bore my Fathers name There was an odd knife in the center the blade held high from two snow capped mountains eight stars at the top three on one side of the knife five on the other Below was an eagle on a green shield Shinny brass buttons held the coat closed each had an eagle with stars above its head the talons held arrows in one claw a branch in the other and a banner in its beak Pins on the lapels read support on a blue banner silver hands held an eight pointed red star On the right were little rainbow ribbons pinned above the pocket bronze leaves on a few stars on some more a knotted cord on crimson and white an M on cream and light blue a 4 on blue yellow and red What did these mean The right side had our last name below a red arrow that held a ships wheel and a shield with a winged wheel Spearhead of Logistics scrolled beneath On that sleeve a black tab Airborne stitched in gold and a bald eagle screaming on a black shield I put on my Fathers coat and found another underneath The shoulders bore white diamonds ivy leaves at the corners The ribbons were as bright but different in pattern Green and yellow with three red stripes green and white with a silver scroll read 69 something that had not ended Another coat rested beneath that one and another further still all smartly packed away but ready to be donned again I put them all back the way I had found them my Fathers treasures were vast but were hidden for a purpose At dinner that night the colors and symbols still danced in my mind Dad what does Airborne mean That was the first time I saw my father cry My mothers eyes went wide but my father just shed tears his dinner forgotten You were in the closet werent you He asked How did he know Mom had not seen me and hed been gone all day I placed everything back where I had found it to the best of my knowledge Ill tell you tomorrow He said and picked up his plate before walking to the kitchen I couldnt sleep that night Was I in trouble What would he say The minutes ticked by like hours the silent darkness passed uninterrupted until the first light of day peaked through my window He knocked softly at my door no time was left for worry and fear The door opened and my father looked down at me still tucked into bed The coat I discovered hung proudly from his shoulders as he sat on my bed Get up and get ready he spoke softly today you will walk with me I pulled on my pants and threw my shirt over my head before picking up my shoes and entering the living room My grandfather was there wearing the second coat I found A tear in his eye as he looked down on me Kind of soon for him isnt it My grandfather asked He has to know sooner or later My father replied We walked across town my father on my right his father on my left laughing and talking about when my father was young People stopped to watch this little parade silent and knowing the truth I was about to learn On the edge of the town was the graveyard grey markers on a field of green but a flag flew proudly in front of a few This is where my father went once a year just before June This is my father my grandfather said in front of a stone polished and carved with our family name My father handed me a gold dollar like the one in his hand My grandfather place a gold dollar on the stone and stepped back to salute My father followed him every action the same and I knew what to do On the way home we stopped at a diner for breakfast People would pass to say thank you between bites of pancakes and eggs My father only nodded and my grandfather smiled I knew nothing needed to be said in reply and my Fathers treasures took on more meaning than gold and silver ever would The thunder of artillery rolls across this new world far from the star that I knew as a child My grandfather rests next to his father now in that green field of stones so far away My father still walks across town to lay a coin on their markers and when I get home from this world I will join him My faith is in my rifle and the armor I wear The man and the woman beside me are more precious than money or power The adventures of my youth are replaced by the realities in front of me as we fight for a treasure more valuable than gold and silver a future for our own sons and daughters a legacy we will give them like my fathers before me 276 upvotes 33

Enough to tell a boss to fuck off Thoughts ricochet within me Bumper cars collide Being stuck and angry sucks I scrolled and scrolled on a Huawei phone Absolutely pissed off at this world Pissed at the times police wanted to take me away for being a mess Sometimes women get pissed Scrolling through their phones Angry at their cheating husbands It really is not that hard to have flairbe a damn white oddity Like moths to a porchlight Particles of sand through hands This is when I first started the habit of it I rather go by a rather empty name of Taishen with further explanation needed but now is not convenient But I assure it is interesting enough and has some importance Habits are various in nature in how they attach to and eat at marrowlike atom bombs flashing as rays evaporating DNAsets in a way less than human as putting myself in the cage of bad things taken upmy time as a former heroin addict is left as stretch marks on me in various ways The same goes for the first time I found myself making arrangements with middle aged married women while desperation of waves whiplashed me like sandpaper hands coming at me to leave me in a tiring state of abrasion I had spent a night snuck away into a hotel Found someone on a business trip Instead of registering I waited to sneak along into the hotel elevator amongst a group of others attending the hotel as I had no card I headed to a designated room number Originally I was sitting in a park Playing on WeChat and found someone in their midthirties Pictures were exchanged and I said no She brought up paying for the hotel if I arrived I agreed and went along When I met I washed up after her and we used our phones to awkwardly translate what we would do Room service knocked I found myself hidden under a bed as I was not registered to be there It seems unusual that it was around this time I had started working on a story of my life as a heroin addict when I got caught up in my worse manic episode ever experienced during my age of 22 Finished half that story before never going back to it after my manic episode had ended Now I am here writing about it and wondering if the same can happen again in the process of this work It feels extremely cliché I would write a novel about struggles with heroin addiction It has been done many times Its just lame of me I feel like my thoughts are bit off I left the hotel the next morning with the little money I did have on a debit card Turns out the woman was from Taiyuan It is a city in the northern part of China in the province of Shanxicoal country with the worst air pollution in China She has a colleague in Taiyuan that takes courses at an English training center I was able to contact this place in the morning via a shared contact on WeChat given to me by the stranger I met that night Before I knew it I was sending my information and documents in my backpack at an internet café in a faxwith the intent that the woman agreed to share my information to the training center as she shared my contact to its hiring manager It would land me a job that day that would help me out of my situation Things turned not quite out as I expected though I was shifted like a ball to somebody else to contact for a training center geared to teaching children I took what I had and ran off to a train station after taking the public transit Unfortunately I was shit for money and could not afford a high speed rail pass The slow train would take thirtytwo hours to get to my destination I would have taken a room with a bed but all I could afford was a hard seat for the travel Things were getting better for me in the circumstance considering I had found someone willing to take me for work despite my visa situation The thirtytwo hour train ride was horrendous in some ways but mostly I was in excitement despite the circumstances Im always giddy when disappointed I moved up and down the aisle of the train I could not speak mandarin but it did not stop me from trying to interact with everyone I talked many ears off during the train ride I went up and down the aisle trying to interact as a moth to porchlightsI could not stop even if I had wanted to I found great enjoyment the times I did get to sit across a table from somebody my age heading to Taiyuan from Chongqing They were a university student returning to their hometown Another passenger who sat beside me was an elderly man with hard boiled eggs he was eating one after another one I highly enjoyed each and every conversation that I had It was like my head was a lightbulb wanting June bugs to bang against it with the intensity of Roman candles shot at my mouth of nicotine tinged teeth If you find someone in Shanxi it is practice to pay the family money before you can get married You would also have to already own a home and a car told my new friend across in their seat from mea university passenger friend named David Not necessarily what I was looking for When is the next stop for snacks When the train stops I am able to get out and to have a walk onto the platform to buy various goods from the vendors to take back with me to eat along the ride to Taiyuan I had all my important documents tucked in my bag This included my health clearance and obviously I made no mention of my mental health diagnosis or history to the doctor who had to evaluate me My diploma and TEFL certificate were tucked away securely A TEFL is a certificate that stands for Teaching English as a Foreign Language it qualifies me to teach English as a second language abroadit had only took a few months of taking a course online that I had paid for to obtain It is easy to be happy when you can trick yourself as your own con artist Mania can make you deceive yourself One can be doused in napalm and still not fully recognize what is actually going on Same goes the flicking of psychosis Even when I have nothing I find myself in my radiating irritation the most qualified of thingsthe velocity of my rhythm sets me out of an orbit The pressure cooker keeps me moving like a propeller at times I finally arrived at Taiyuan I arrived at the station to be greeted by Ryan my manager and his assistant Jennifer We had our hello and introduction and they helped me get to a taxi that would bring me to my new apartment I finally had a residence again Apparently they were desperate for a teacher The last teacher was from New Mexico and apparently they pulled a midnight runthat is when a teacher in the middle of the night disappears onto a plane back home without any notification of it The apartment was okay On the fourth floor with no elevator so it was a bit of a climb up a dark stairwell not lit correctly My job was a training center that had a location near Yingze Park in the center of the city I was to be paid in cash via envelopes I would assist in teaching kindergarten all the way up to high school aged students there in private lessons paid by their parents I would also be assigned by my company to various primary schools in the city I would take public buses to various schools paid by the company I worked for to give English lessons as I bounced around to various classrooms and schools in the city Often I would receive a phone call to avoid going to work that day if my boss got inside input that officials would be doing raids to check foreigners visas that day A taxi ride would always be a thrill Caused me nerves at first but I came to love the flying in dangerous ways along a busy road I remember a driver beeping their horn away as they drove onto the sidewalk to pass people They treated the pedestrians as if they were in the wrong I came flying in front of a primary school at its front gates I was going to start teaching a first grade classroom and a kindergarten classroom The way schools are set up is with a wall around the entirety of the exterior of the school There is a gate at the front where one or two security will be waiting to let people in and out of the complex of the school I walked in front of the gate to greet the security It was my first time with an assignment at this school The guard said they had never seen me before and wouldnt let me in Not a big nuisance while I called my boss who then called the school to sort out the situation I miss the classroom so much I ended up teaching in China for five years at various training schools After returning to Illinois I still taught as a primary school teacher in a public school I often feel extremely ugly from inside to my outside but something is attractive there This does not come just in terms of flirting and relationshipsmania makes me a genuine lightbulb that flickers in a way that encourages the insects to meeveryone looks like a June bugthis is what I have come to understand about life But that ugly does kind of stay like rot in a cavity that leaves a bad taste in the mouth that smells foulhoping nobody catches the smell near meit must tie into my struggles with bulimia over the years The same goes for my years as a teacherin relation to the whole lightbulb phenomenonIm positive it is tied to mania and hypomania The younger students always were fixated on the information I was teaching to them I kept over the years methods taught to me and selftaught that I found extremely effective with younger students when it comes to teaching Everything was physical in learning in terms of intensity and ambition When teaching my first grade classroom I would create flashcards for the vocab we would work on and implement in creating new sentences with We would chant these words together in a way that made me a clown while teaching Students would yell out the word that I presented with intense enthusiasm As I walked by students it was expected that while they yelled out the word they would also physically hit the card Later I would also work on physical gestures and acting out of vocab words and they would follow the actions and phrases with me I would often eventually turn the class into two teams When students got an answer right I would behave comically and full of energyI would give them a high five and pretend they were so strong with it that it hurt my hand in the process with much exaggerationthe students always seemed to never get tired of this act One game I would play involved drawing two stick figures with happy faces on them Each figure would represent one of the teams for the classroom I would draw a hungry alligator under the figures Their faces would also be comical in appearance and full of exaggerations Each figure had a parachute placed over them and four strings attached During the game the students would race to say the word correctly represented on the flashcard or the correct word for the gesture I was making The team that was not the slowest would lose a string on the parachute If a team lost all four strings they would fall to the alligator who would eat them The students found it hilarious with my actions involved in it I would also draw tears and a person praying to represent anticipation and worry of falling down each time they lost a string I had a tooth game too I would draw too large faces for each team The team that could answer the flashcards and gestures the quickest would have a tooth drawn in their mouth The team with the most teeth would win and it would look rather funny as the mouth grew and grew with an abnormal and extreme amount of teeth I often did other physical and interactive games like having students run to the word I showed a card to or gesturedeach word would be attached to a point in the classroom on a wall I know it sounds grandiose but the parents always seemed to think I was great at my job The word vulnerable means so many things to me That word is like the coal to form the generator that makes the guiding energy for the ethics I follow in my lifeI hold very strongly to these values that have developed on how to liveI can express it more later but I greatly attach a kind of Christian value system to it which makes sense considering I was raised in a Lutheran household and always went to church Sunday school and went to my courses and went through my confirmationeveryone is a bit of a mopsome pick up clean water and others dirty or a mix of itwaiting to find the people to drain them voluntarily or involuntarily I was born vulnerable I walk pigeontoed and grew up tripping on my feetI speak with a soft feminine voice Bipolar disorder makes somebody vulnerable There was much vulnerability in being eighteen and hospitalized involuntarily for my first manic episodetied to a stretcher I have almost a sense of us vs themthe vulnerable and those that harm the vulnerabletake advantage of the vulnerableI feel this is a very much Christian in the idea of the unfortunate are more holy than the rest of the bunchchildren are like that in terms of being born into a cruel existencea cruel existence I felt at times in my life and so many domaking sure harm does not come to those in need gives the light of purpose to go bright inside like a Christmas tree in my brainthis light of happiness and warmth I never expected I would fall in love for teaching due to the antidepressant effect provided It would become my career for a decade Some grow up wanting to be a teacher I became one by accident desperation and being saved Sometimes I inflate on selfhate like a helium balloon that needs to be tied to a wrist The vulnerability equation is imprinted on my brain In my early teens I started struggling with bulimia and image I remember when my mother caught me in the act I was not offered help but criticized I was called a girl for my problems and threatened to be taken somewhere to be fixed of my confusion I dont identify as transgender I identify as a man that struggles with bulimia and happens to have feminine qualities I attribute it to circumstances that happened to mea justification for the pain at timesan attack on aspects of bisexuality After a long day of work I did what my young self often did I went clubbing with friends I feel like even if I hide aspects of myself such as being bisexual people can spot it regardless Im extremely secretive about it and not comfortable displaying that vulnerable aspect of myself My friend from England went with me He was about six years my senior Big guy Tall The clubs name was Maoye I always enjoyed the free drinks available to foreignersit was done to attract Chinese clients as the idea was foreigners being there would attract people Amongst the hot and sweltering crowd a man grabbed ahold of me I felt stuck I was taken off guard Pushed and cornered While on me I managed to push him off But it all serves as a reminder of the vulnerability of my life A nail was placed into my handa constant burn and reminder of that vulnerability Part 2 From selfhate I can also be so grandiose I am like a Christmas tree that is lit up Sparklers so pretty that you cannot let go of them even if it burns your fingertips and hurts From heroin to sex you can smother the pain You drain the ocean to fill a void in these times It ties to mania as well That restlessness and irritability is extinguished by the paradox of throwing kerosene to everything burning Im so grandiose to hide my insecurities I mistake my misfortune as a mark of something ugly virtuousthe neon of vulnerability pulsating like a star within me Swelling on a pain Bad habits I want you to judge me and tell me whats wrong with me Give me a verdict Stress a trigger for mania and I was stressed from the incident I had experienced at the club I bloated like a tick to distract from locusts of thoughts that could not shut up with their commotion I had been sleeping around more than before My brain was Christmas tree lights I accelerated on a generatorI made a mixed episode worse Tease a disaster when you are heightened like a blimp Full of hydrogen Hoping to burn up ad rain down like napalm When the pretty candles on the Christmas tree are left untouchednot looked at like a kettle on burner that has been forgottenthe dry neglected tree will into a house fire Ive had four attempts in my life so far When I attempt I dont cry for help I feel too vulnerable Im afraid Hate police and wards Downing pills My past failed attempts made me aware of everything done wrong before The sleeping pills alone might not do what I was looking for at that time I bought an electrical cable This way if it failed I would still be unconscious and choked out by the cordfail safe plan to end my life The words coming out of my mouth slowed down I started getting second thoughts Stuck my face towards the toilet bowl while on my knees Sticking my fingers down my throat Leaving blood vessels bursting in my eyes Went stumbling outside and waved a taxi down and asked to be taken to the local hospital Never expected finding myself checked into a psych ward in a foreign country Nietzsche has a quote in reference to chaos in life and how it is needed to create a starthis reference holds so much value to me Sometimes stars hit together just right to create fate out of the worst of things The ward lead me to meet the woman made of paper She would one day become my wife I would have two daughters with her Forge together as soldiers to face the obstacles in life Someone who would save my life during a future attempt when I was found unconscious from an overdose The smartest and toughest woman I have ever known Someone to build trenches with I liked it when she stuck that needle in me for an IV It must correlate to being a heroin addict The pushing of something in my vein correlates to happiness and purity The woman made out of paper was my nurse in the ward I was stuck in What attracted her to the mess that is me I will never understand fully The woman made out of paper is named Lilu She was one year older than me and one of my nurses at that ward in Taiyuan She was from Zhengzhoua city in the province of Henan that is based in the center of China I am sure as the reader it would be nice to know why I call her the woman made of paper She struggled with her own demons She also deserves much praise for her resilience and brains When she was born she was raised by a family that adopted her and often neglected and abused her growing up Her biological family is distant from her even though she has an identical twinthey felt too poor to take care of her and made the choice that they needed to be less of one child as she also has an older sisterher twin got to stay with that family but she was given up and adopted I am sure this must bother her even if she never will talk about it to anyone in her lifeas she is one to refuse ever discussing emotions and feelings as this is not her personality typeshe is very much a fighter I think most would struggle with wondering why they were the one let go ofit also must hurt her knowing that the family would have a son and keep him Despite all these circumstances she graduated top of her class of four thousand studentsChinese high schools can be quite large serving a large regionthey often serve as boarding schools She was a smart and hardworking student Circumstances never made her stop trying to be the best and moving forward and she never made excuses for herself In university she also did well and got accepted at the most studious and hard to obtain nursing position at the number one hospital in Shanxi I have already ranted and gone on about my affection and feelings tied to heroin Drinking of entire oceans to fill voids Paper is a void It asks for calligraphy to be written on it to make braille This way when fingers run over skin it tells worththe reason for troublesit forms connection through those words of declarationthe whining for why things are the way they arethe filling of a void like a heroin addict needing a curetwo papers come together to write upon one anotheras a paper I am her typoI stand as a falling mess with nerves like tripwire I keep failing and losing my composer while she stands stronger as a declaration that has been written onwhen I was chased I listened to her and joined as one I wish and intend to always serve the woman made out of paper who has saved my life and has always been there for me being so strong despite circumstancesamongst the wind of turmoil in life I follow along her path It was love at first sight for her but not for me I had no interest in dating her at the time I worked across the street of that hospital in an office building for a training center as a part time job I would teach adults English who paid for private lessons near to Yingze park in the center of Taiyuan She signed up for classes for me to teach her and brought me food on almost every other day that she had prepared Eventually we found ourselves coupled fully In a pit I get to burn as paper amongst anothers paper Eternally With a life that will keep reoccurring Part 3 Liu A woman like Change lived on a moon Far away You can refer to me as Liu At the age of 19 I was diagnosed with a severe nerve pain condition It is called trigeminal neuralgia but you can call it TN for ease I was frustrated I had completed a degree in international finances from Chongqing University of Business and Technology The boom of the economy was not the same There was an urge to lay flatto not try as a form of opposition to everything going on in a waning economy in China All are elephants chained for an audience People love to peek and stare as though they are glass doors without hingesto be made feel useless I developed TN at the age of 19 and was now 22 It came as an arrow and quite literally to the face Its a rare nerve pain disorder often considered one of the most painful conditions known The illness involves intense nerve pain throughout the left side of my face It felt like someone was trying to pull all of the teeth on the left side of my face without anesthesia The pain can leave me falling to the floor unable to speak or move while screaming profanities while choked by pain A feeling of a knife to my face over and over again It leaves me in absolute shock Like Roman candles to the face An absolute hindrance The anticipation of not knowing when it will happen again is a nightmare at times The disease is often called the suicide disease apparently up to 26 try to take their lives In a state of panic during one of the nerve attacks I began swallowing any pill near to me I went to the hospital to have my stomach pumped when I was found comatose by my mother I want to be Change and on the moon and away from a world I have had enough of Gossip spread around the workplace that I attempted suicide over an affair with a married man There was too much guilt to return to the workplace COVID did have an impact to the economy I still remember my hometown having dirt and trees piled onto the exits and entrances to the city keep people in their places The work I did find felt beneath me China has what is called the great firewall that keeps something in and out of the countrys networks A VPN was necessary to access American TikTok as it was used as opposed to the Chinese version Feels humiliating the nature of the outcome for meI gave up in many ways like so many Chinese youth For work I would go to a local office building Amongst a long hall would be a room for live stream performers I would entertain with watchers while trying to obtain virtual gifts for actual money I despised itsometimes the conversation could be funny or interesting but it felt hollow I would paint flowers on my face and wear hanfu clothing while doing ASMR I had a mind of sparklers burning until it burnt and stung like waxlike I had the option to stop and cry and those tears stuck as wax and burnt or I soldiered on and grew accustomed to the pain I was an elephant chained The audience watched and interacted with me on the live I was a chained elephant when it was found out about my previous attempt and when the rumors spread Too many thorns in life Nails hitting at the wrong points like an equation for something terrible to eventually happen My favorite dish was Henan noodles I often cooked it with my mom It provides great memories of childhood I hadnt talked to my mother as much as before She moved to a job in Taiyuan Sometimes I would go up to visit her But it was harder as she worked more and more hours Sometimes voids build even when going through extreme nerve pain And with trigeminal neuralgia the pain was so intense that I would freeze and scream in pain It cannot always be hid It made me an elephant tethered Life can be like a pressure like no other Too much stress Makes one feel irritable with a mouth like a sprinkler of napalm when someone is too close Life feels like a lit fire cracker heldin the end it would tear my hand up Things kept building while the other side of my face began to hurt too recently This was rare and not so common My eyesight was becoming blurry too and it seemed I might have multiple sclerosis as the pain was on both side it was not common for my age and the blurry eyesight An appointment was scheduled and I felt terrified to know what was going on and wondered if it was best to not even know my health I walked out of the studio and had a cigarette My boss came out and joined to talk He was concerned about view count and wanted me to do things to increase it that made me feel uncomfortable He made a few comments I found incentive The boss sure liked to criticize and apply pressure He was not impressed with my work and thought I could do something different In China an application is used called WeChat This application has many uses People can display and share moments like a Facebook wall message each other send money video chat and even has a feature to find people near to you who are also looking for people near to them I was to attract people onto dates The idea was they would be lured in and the men would go to a set destination to a planned tea house that served snacks When the men arrived they had no knowledge of the setup the bill would be at an absurd rate and if the men refused to pay larger men would use their size to force them to pay up I was not sure at the time yet if I wanted the job Being worried about ethics and safety It was something I would have to think about My medical expenses were growing and I knew the nerve disease could be expensive to treat with surgery All I had was thoughts while looking at the moon Part 4 Taishen My former roommate in the ward I shared a room with had paranoid schizophrenia I was stuck in the same place due to mania and just had gotten my diagnosis of bipolar disorder I was so pissed being stuck there and felt I had no business being there I found my diagnosis to be an insult to me I was only 18 at the timetaken in on a stretcher Made me feel very vulnerable and irritated My roommate was having delusions related to Christianity and could not stop waking me up in the middle of the night to ask and talk about Jesus Left me beyond frustrated He was drifting from his wife and would go on and on about intending to leave her Felt he was spied and plotted against by her So we were both frustrated with being there The toilets were special They would flush what needed to be flushed but not certain things like pillsit helped to keep people from hiding they were not taking their medications He had tried to flush his wedding ring down the toilet but he did not realized it didnt flush I went to use the restroom later and saw the ring I told him He took it out He found it to be a sign form God that he is to stay with his wife and there was immense happiness in his eyes Tisishen Part Continued I was stuck at my current work at Maoye A mall in the central part of Taiyuan in Shanxi Coal dust central China Frequent dust storms leaving me having to wipe the window sills of dust piles collecting Life felt dry as the airnumb I never know what I want Drifting like paper in a breeze 23 and feeling empty Left the previous English training center I working at teaching adults Company started going bankrupt Boss was an asshole He was originally from Datong near to Inner Mongolia That boss ran the company horribly Was a coward of a boss He would watch the cameras and email complaints on my dress code and not talk to me in person A coward When the company was nosediving I got sent an email in the middle of the day stating my job would be terminated by the end of the month I worked in china as an American In china most jobs are based on contracts between employees and employers I was supposed to continue another seven months with my job The contract was broken when they emailed me saying they could not keep me due to salary Contracts can be broken due to performance but not due to finance issues I had already work for them a year on another contract The law in China states I was due to be paid a year and a half of salary My boss was such a coward to not speak to me in person and email the letter I marched in his office and got told to fuck myself I talked to the labor board at the local government office I was told was told that I that they would have to pay me a year and a half of salary for breaking my contract Those times were rather gray for me Clouds were heavy like gnats flying around the face My girlfriend at the time was a stern nurse The girl made of paper She stayed beside My fortress Put up for adoption by her family in Henan Where her adopted mother would put her hands in scolding hot water for punishment She marched into my bosss office and created a storm He refused to budge A few days later when the labor office contacted him he was willing to keep me for the rest of my contract The labor office said that because my job was offered back I could not be paid if I left my job as it would be my choice at that point Frustrating My wife had her uncles boss contacted from Taiyuan to go into the office She had some influence in the area She threatened to look over various certificates to get the branch in trouble My boss did not budge I decided to just go ahead and leave this English training center for teaching adults I went for a new company that paid more passed in the Moye mall on the other end of the city Now I would be teaching children again like I used Is this all I am A server It makes me think of a time right before I met the woman made of paper Stern from her experiences A fighter I like fighters I met fighters before Reminds me of a story A story I hold deeply to my heart There was a woman named Ming I met her through surfing on WeChat nearby searching for people looking for others nearby Older by a few years Met and became acquainted over messages Christmas tree lights in my head Perched to be exploited Balloon with the air let out Hissing all the time because it whines The inferno in me wants me to burn Because it feels right Christmas trees lit are under pressurethey know if they dry up the whole building will be in flames So you have to be festive when you decorateand avantgarde with who you decorate with Maximalist at heart with pleasure Nomads tend to wander to find a better part of the steppe With a phallus as a Swiss Army Knife Paddling in northern China building a trench 22 year old Midwesterner with psychosis looking for a frigate to save him from the deep end Impulsivity a catalyst for losing everything I dont care if youre married if you have a tunnel you can help me in the trench Two staged rocket Already psychotic Be a Launchpad So I can get even further from earth Ripple through the galaxy like I got a mission Even if its delusional Another N1 Get myself on disconnect in the vacuum Even if I come down Iike napalm I met Ming because I needed her and she needed meeven if she was married I was 23 and without security MY first job that I forgot from my boss Ryan was insane at times Working without a visa for a company was unbearable I felt obligated to my boss at that time he promised he could solve my issue if I worked hard for him And I did He was a bit corrupt too and not the greatest Always offering going to brothels with people to make deals happen including trying with me too I never went I did work hard for him though I wanted to escape my predicament and he knew all the right people to contact to fix my problems if I met my obligations Obligations could mean being asked to go to another training center to work part time and gather their curriculum for my school It felt unstable not knowing when I could get arrested or taken away Made Ming a perfect connection to come across I needed a friend that brought stability She was a radio broadcaster in the city Extremely wealthy She would take me on outings eating delicious cuisine in the city or among weekend trips to interesting places nearby I consider her one of the greatest friends I had Because of her it was getting to meet other connections at outings with friends at KTV and clubs in the city Like rhizomes growing out of a tree Sustainability It led to more rhizomes of connections Something I want to talk more about But I need to move the clock a bit To the start of this ramble I was working in Maoye I was on a legal visa at this time My colleagues were not legal They were often Slavic Russian Ukraine and other Slavic nations We had an office in the building setup on a third floor of a large mal with various classrooms for the foreign teachers to teach in They would generally have a Chinese teaching assistant to help them in the classrooms I taught students from prek age to middle school there In the middle of the setup of the floor layout was a large open office I would sit and plan lessons and grade amongst the Chinese staff and foreign teachers One day I grep of plain clothed officers came into the facility They were checking on teachers on the wrong visas The Russian teachers and others often could not fluently speak English or qualify for the correct visasthey didnt meet the right requirements for work visas and would be on other various kinds of visas They stormed in and I remember my Russian friend hearing the commotion tore his shirt with his logo on it and threw it on the ground in a rush He ran shirtless down a stair well nearby flinging the doors open Fear anger got to fill their class schedule while they are all out hiding Final Taishen I met Change Do you believe in the transplanting of thoughts I do Like pollen My thoughts can transplant and Change can do the same too Mania got me again I wrote a poem when I was younger to express it Feeling bold and exacerbated Maybe I am just high strung Ricocheting off these walls like bumper cars A sparkler burning hot and bright Popping off like roman candles I am not always calm but I am high A kettle left on the burner and forgotten Watch me melt away into my ecstasy Where I dance and scream all in one Ill hit peak when crisis comes I hadnt been sleeping I took a second English teaching job and was seeing attending to seeing different people besides Ming Ming was kind and always took me on nice dinner dates I didnt have to worry about expenses and felt secure I was back on my smartphone looking and fishing for people nearby Change came in as a breeze from Luoyang to meeting a relative in Taiyuan Change was working for a boss in Taiyuan She would go on the WeChat application looking for men nearby Flirt to get them to meet her Like moths in dark they get to the lights Useless as a glass door You can peek through Pigeontoed Drained an ocean to fill insecurities Uncomfortable thoughts ricochet in me Like an ambush Giddy when disappointed I build trenches amongst the tripwires of life City feels like a tsunami Manners like a bloated tick Sipping the veins from any limb around me As a stranger to a moth a porch light pulling Desolate in lost thoughts Nights awake and bunkering in hotels Soft in my voice I hopscotch to handsfalling through like particles of sand With enough friction to set off an atom bomb To radiate right through me and hollow my marrow Amongst open nerves I can feel something so I play with the pain No matter how annoying As particles I transplanted through to her screen as we lay in our separate beds in the city Mania makes me dumb We flattered away Fused as particles Her intent was for me to arrive at a designated location to drink and eat late into the night1100 pm With this given location I would be taken down like an elephant via poachersthat was the intent At the location I was to be given an outrageous bill for the service and if I did not pay a group of big men would use their physical presence to get me to pay When I met her at the given location outside the door I knew the tricks I tested her Asked if she would be willing to eat at another location She thought she would eat me and I thought I would eat her My test was asking her to go to another place at the KTV nearby where I knew somebody that worked therea karaoke locationthe LED lights shining and me and her staring at the direction of them She hesitated and insisted on the location next to us I said I had to gobefore I left to contact if willing in the future to go to the KTV Where a perpetual hydrogen bomb would go off on our fused particles Upvote Downvote comments Short story please give feedback Short story please give feedback FN The Dragon Goddess of Transformation This is my first time posting one of my short stories I would love to get some feedback on what works and what doesnt Isyldra hatched under a canopy of emerald leaves the warmth of the rainforest sun dappling his dull green scales He was a male dragon yet from his earliest memories an inexplicable unease stirred within him As he grew so did the dissonance between his physical form and his inner self The other dragons his brothers and sisters reveled in their shared identity their roughandtumble games of hunting and fighting But Isyldra found solace in the delicate beauty of the rainforest preferring to collect vibrant flowers and listen to the whispers of the wind through the leaves His gentle nature and love for all things beautiful earned him scorn and mockery from his peers their harsh words piercing his heart like poisoned thorns But Kestrel a seafoam green dragon with vibrant pink eyes understood She was a whirlwind of contradictions a harmonious blend of fire and ice Her eyes usually a vibrant pink would occasionally shift to a deep emerald green reflecting her complex nature Kestrel had been Isyldras closest companion since their hatchling days the first to witness the hidden femininity that blossomed beneath his dull green scales She was fiercely protective of Isyldra her claws sharp and her breath hot when danger threatened but beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold Kestrel possessed a rare ability to connect with others her infectious laughter and genuine interest drawing creatures of all shapes and sizes into her orbit She made friends with everyone from the smallest insects to the most imposing beasts her open heart and unwavering loyalty forging bonds that transcended species and social barriers Isyldras mother a crystalline dragon named Elara was a breathtaking sight to behold Her scales shimmered with every color imaginable reflecting the light of the sun and moon in a dazzling display Strong yet nurturing tough but fair Elara embodied the perfect balance of power and compassion Her voice a gentle melody held the wisdom of a thousand lifetimes and her presence radiated a warmth that could melt the coldest of hearts She was a fierce protector of her children her crystalline scales shimmering with an intimidating glow when danger threatened but her heart remained a haven of unconditional love and acceptance Elara believed in the power of color to heal and inspire and she dedicated her life to spreading beauty and joy throughout the world Elara had always been a pillar of unconditional love and support She would often soar to the heavens whispering prayers to the stars for the wellbeing and happiness of her hatchlings Her unwavering belief in Isyldras unique spirit had instilled in him a quiet strength empowering him to embrace his true self Determined to discover his true self Isyldra embarked on a solitary journey Kestrel always in his thoughts his mothers love a guiding light in his heart He sought the wisdom of the ancient tree spirit who revealed the secrets of transformation hidden deep within the rainforests heart Isyldra underwent a series of trials each one designed to challenge his perception of self The first trial involved navigating a dense thicket of thorns a physical manifestation of the pain and struggle of shedding societal expectations The sharp barbs tore at Isyldras dull green scales each puncture a searing reminder of the harsh words and mocking laughter that had haunted him for so long Scales once a symbol of strength and protection now crumbled and fell away revealing the tender flesh beneath A wave of nausea washed over Isyldra the vulnerability leaving him exposed and raw He felt a deepseated terror a primal fear of being seen for who he truly was Every instinct screamed at him to retreat to rebuild the walls he had so carefully constructed around his heart But a flicker of defiance sparked within him His mothers unwavering love Kestrels fierce loyalty the tree spirits cryptic guidance they all echoed in his mind urging him forward He took a hesitant step then another his claws sinking into the soft earth drawing strength from the ancient rainforest that had nurtured him since birth With every agonizing step Isyldra felt a weight lifting from his shoulders a burden he hadnt even realized he carried The pain was intense but it was also strangely liberating Each fallen scale was a piece of the past discarded a step closer to the truth of his being And then a miracle As the old scales fell away new ones emerged glistening with an ethereal light They were softer more delicate shimmering with an iridescent sheen that reflected the colors of the rainforest A surge of joy coursed through Isyldra a realization dawning upon him he was not losing himself but rather finding himself The pain was a catalyst for growth a necessary step on his journey towards selfdiscovery The thicket of thorns had become a crucible of transformation forging a stronger truer version of himself The second trial required him to cross a raging river a representation of the emotional turmoil and the fear of the unknown that accompanied his transformation The water a churning mass of white foam and swirling eddies roared with a deafening fury threatening to sweep Isyldra away into its murky depths Each time he plunged into the icy torrent the current tore at his body ripping away more scales The sensation was agonizing both physically and emotionally Fear clawed at his throat the uncertainty of what lay ahead a chilling weight on his heart Every lost scale felt like a piece of himself chipped away leaving him exposed and vulnerable to the relentless judgment of the world Yet as the river stripped him bare it also revealed something extraordinary Beneath the dull green scales a symphony of vibrant hues began to emerge Pinks soft and delicate like the petals of a rainforest orchid swirled and danced alongside bold electrifying blues reminiscent of the sky after a summer storm These colors so long hidden and suppressed burst forth with a radiant energy that filled Isyldra with a newfound sense of wonder and excitement With each surge of the current a wave of terror was followed by a rush of elation He was not simply losing himself he was becoming something new something vibrant and beautiful The fear of the unknown transformed into a thrilling anticipation of the possibilities that lay ahead The final trial led Isyldra to a hidden waterfall a place of selfreflection and acceptance The cascade of water thundered down a symphony of natures raw power As she stood before the crystalclear pool at its base her reflection wavered and danced the waters movement distorting her image But as she gazed deeper as if drawn into a trance by the mesmerizing flow the chaos stilled The water became a placid mirror and her reflection transformed before her very eyes The dull green scales the mask she had worn for so long melted away like morning mist In its place a breathtaking mosaic of vibrant colors bloomed across her body Blue as deep as the twilight sky blended seamlessly into soft blushing pinks and the purest of whites shimmered like starlight Each scale was a masterpiece a testament to the unique beauty that had always resided within her A gasp escaped Isyldras lips her heart thrumming with a heady mix of fear and exhilaration She reached out a trembling hand her fingertips barely grazing the surface of the pool The water rippled again but her reflection remained a majestic dragon goddess her true self revealed Isyldra collapsed to her knees tears streaming down her face no longer tears of pain and selfdoubt but of pure unbridled joy Her inner self so long suppressed and hidden was finally free to soar As the Dragon Goddess of Transformation Isyldra soared through the skies her heart overflowing with a newfound joy and purpose The journey had been arduous filled with pain and doubt but the reward was immeasurable She had discovered her true self shed the shackles of societal expectations and emerged as a radiant beacon of hope for others struggling to find their own path Every shimmering scale on her body served as a testament to her strength resilience and the transformative power of selfacceptance Isyldra and Kestrel traveled together their bond deepened by shared experience and unwavering support They became a symbol of unity and acceptance their differences complementing each other in a dance of vibrant hues The rainforest thrived under Isyldras care its colors intensified its creatures emboldened by her presence The flowers bloomed brighter the rivers flowed stronger and the very air hummed with the energy of transformation Isyldras fame spread far and wide attracting creatures from distant lands seeking her guidance and wisdom She welcomed them with open arms her gentle spirit and unwavering belief in their potential igniting a spark of hope in even the most broken of hearts Under her tutelage they shed their fears and insecurities embracing their true selves with newfound confidence and purpose Isyldras influence extended beyond the rainforest her message of selfacceptance echoing through the mountains valleys and oceans inspiring a wave of transformation that swept across the world Upvote Downvote comments A Love Letter to Humanity cw suicide and violence A Love Letter to Humanity cw suicide and violence May this letter find you in a spirit of anger My name is Dick Neilson renowned geneticist chairperson of the International Council of Freedom and Prosperity ICFP and soontobe mass murderer I greet you in anguish This letter will serve as my confession my suicide note and my billetdoux to humanity Come what may Shakespeare originally popularized that expression come what may in Macbeth which is a story about what happens when you let fate meddle with everything Hes dead and wont mind my borrowing it I would argue that trusting fate is the metaphysical equivalent of trusting a drunk chimpanzee behind the wheel of a speeding semi in rush hour traffic which is what humanity has been doing for centuries No more We have taken the wheel Part 1 Reality is a bastard and we are its many fathers In 2030 we overshot Earths population limit by several billion This was our core concern at the International Council of Freedom and Prosperity which was affectionately nicknamed The Old White Mans Club by leftleaning journalist Jim Freznik Hes not wrong for we are old and white and men Say what you will Our intentions were pure I digress War famine genocide most of it can be linked back to dwindling resources spread between too many people Like many scientists before us we dabbled And like many scientists before us we irrevocably reshaped humanity in our own image Come what may Ill put it even more bluntly I have stolen from billions of men women and children living in the western hemisphere There I said it The object of my theft the latter half of their natural lifespan Very few of them will live past the age of 45 I am 70 Like so many before me I have lived too long Before you crucify me know this In terms of eugenics I am Robinhood stealing from an opulent piggish era to give to an impoverished future And the outlook was very poor I assure you I could forgive the desecration of life and nature as a result of necessity But I could not and will not forgive its destruction in the glutinous pursuit of prosperity I am not sorry and please let me explain Part 2 The forlorn hope Even when I was born in the year of 1960 the Earth was bursting at the seams with useless people My father Alex Neilson was one of them He worked as an advertising man He never created anything or helped anyone in his life His mission was to tickle an insatiable hunger for material things mirages for people to chase with their money God forgive him because he was damn good at it The American Dream of the 1960s had a white picket fence because my father put it there Men like my father drove the consumerist feeding frenzy that decimated our planet but he didnt do it intentionally He was a natural born storyteller Like all good storytellers he was a romantic and a true believer which ironically made him more susceptible to the hunger than most His mirage was an abstract feeling success manifested in sparkling chrome luxury and speed the Cadillac When were finally rich Im going to take you on a ride to the coast in our brand new Cadillac he would say to my mother laughing and then kissing her on the cheek It was a wonderful dream or so it seemed And then finally on a warm summer day in 1969 he got his wish We went to the dealership to see the Cadillacs To my nine year old eyes they looked the same a blue one here cream with green accent stripes convertible topped to me it didnt matter I did not see the mythos that had enveloped my father I saw only a car Over tireless hours of talking to the salesman we went over each feature in painstaking detail The millimeter thickness of the leather upholstery the pearl inlay on the dashboard knobs trunk size upgrade options and on and on He settled on a cream convertible with green accent fenders and leather upholstery to match I expected him to be overjoyed on the ride home Instead we drove in silence When we arrived home I watched him inspecting the machinery in the driveway running his fingers across the fenders This one isnt quite flush he said bending down to examine it closer Dick come here Do you see that I looked at the fender and then at my father and then back at the fender It looked normal to me and that is what I told him No no Its not quite flush Ill have to call the dealership in the morning and have them work it out Ill never forget the look on his face the inability to reconcile the material object with the myth the mass produced pile of metal with the fantasy It was as if a Cadillac had died and left its Earthly pulp decaying in our driveway I didnt understand it then but here is what I think my father realized in that moment there is no such thing as a Cadillac and there never was The mirage had moved further down the road only the the hunger remained It may have been the hunger Or it may have been my parents crumbling marriage But life would get the better of him as it has a way of doing And when I was only 17 he went out to the garage started his beloved Cadillac and went to sleep He was only 58 PS To my knowledge my parents never did take that ride to the coast Part 3 Corruption of my youth After my father died I took to emptiness and made it a part of me I simplified my room to a single mattress and pillow I got rid of decorations posters comics childrens games I was determined to change the world It was my obligation I stayed away from women and booze and drugs and worked diligently in my text books To this day I have not slept with a woman although I had many opportunities My reasons are no longer concerned with studiousness however It comes down to a more practical matter of resource conservation Human couples consume three times the amount of resources than singles with their pizza date nights Caribbean cruise vacations Costco shopping etc Humans get fat and happy when theyre together Its biology the desire to mate keep the species going and prosper It is our undoing The closest Ive ever gotten to a woman was in college Her name was Julie I was not attracted to her but she was attractive like the way a finger painting or clay mug is attractive Her zeal for genetics nearly equaled my own We met as lab partners where our ideas fed off each other Soon we were frequent partners in study Thats when I first told her about CRISPR a dawning gene editing process of that time Want bigger muscles Just edit the gene Want to change your predisposition to breast cancer Just edit the gene It all seemed so hopeful Of course we know now that editing one gene causes a snowball of faults in others CRISPR was abandoned after UK scientists turned two embryos into cancer soup But in those days it looked promising especially to an young and ambitious geneticists like me and Julie We dug deep and together innovated what I still believe was the first CRISPR delivery system This would be our big break Our ticket to think tanks and world changing projects All we needed was live test subjects and I knew exactly where to find them The University of Ohios anthropology department had several chimps that were being taught sign language Chimp DNA is just a hairs difference from human DNA These I suggested to Julie would be our subjects Our Adams and our Eves I lied to the anthropology department about taking blood samples for genetic analysis to get close to the chimps Wed actually be giving several of them CRISPR injections that would change fur color from brown to blonde One injection and in a few weeks there would be blonde chimps walking around What would they think of that Everything went to plan The sedated chimps stretched before us I handed Julie the syringe with the CRISPR I watched her watching the chimps gently stroking their fur her gaze softening in an almost motherly way It was then that I knew she wouldnt be able to do it She took my syringe of CRISPR and left without a word We didnt speak much after that Last I heard of her she got married like everyone else Had a family like everyone else Doomed the world like everyone else Part 3 You cant make an omelette without breaking a few eggs There is an investigative journalist from Midland Ohio that wont be going home to his family For that I am sorry And although I will eventually be a murderer many times over this reporter was my first and most intentional It couldnt be helped Jim Freznek was a consumer watchdog reporter which ironically put us on the same side Although he didnt see it that way According to his Facebook he had a beautiful wife age 44 and a son age 5a happy family by all appearances He was good at his job His face frequented local news reports about storms traffic jams ribbon cuttings smalltime saltoftheEarth stories He caught his big break when a fracking company moved into Midland and turned the local drinking water into cancerous sludge That was his rocket to an investigative reporting position for CBS His big break the event that set our paths on an inevitable collision course Come what may I imagine he literally jumped out of his seat when he got an email from a whistleblower at our virus research center in Wuhan Of course we knew who the whistleblower was We hired a lackey to audit the movement of specimen inventory He felt lucky to be there and was woefully under qualified That was the whole point We needed things to be loose But we underestimated him He caught on And so he sent the email and sealed Jims fate Its regrettable I didnt plan to kill Jim when he came to my office In fact I planned to tell him everything The damage had already been done The wildly contagious virus had already escaped Wuhan and infected most of the world And my suicide was already top of mind and in motion No real damage could be done Jim would be my chance to explain everything my righteous vessel for sanctification When he walked into my office he carried the air of a man who already knew all the answers How wrong he was I denied nothing and then I expounded His face grew pale and flat as I explained how wed engineered a virus to compromise DNA How wed let it spread to billions of men women and children How it caused a fatal mutation in heart tissue at the age of 45 But I also explained our situation how the Earths soil was going barren from industrialized farming That glaciers would be gone by 2100 That wars violence and super storms would only get worse as temperatures became unbearable He sat there for a long time stoic It was a lot to take in Im sure And then he leaned forward and said My wife just got over the virus and she turns 45 next week I expected outrage I expected self righteous judgement I did not expect him to jump across the desk and place his hands around my neck which is what he did I tried to relax into the consequences of my sin honestly I did Jims hands squeezed My heart palpitated into my neck Every vessel of my blood fought for oxygen This was it the valley of the shadow of death I was ready but my biology was not I gripped deep into the carpet for resolve Then I felt the handle of a stray letter opener and in an instant I had driven the blade deep into Jims neck I hadnt done it consciously of course A survival instinct had taken control once again betrayed by biology I watched in horror as Jim went still on my office rug My chance for redemption bled out before my eyes His death will forever be my deepest regret We were on the same side fighting the good fight to stop the pillage of the Earth and its people We had very different ways of going about it His was a long game too long We did not have the time Part 4 An ode to harsh medicine They say suicide is the cowards way out In my case that couldnt be further from the truth Im not a hypocrite thats all I will be among the first to relieve the Earth of my burden bravely walking into uncertain darkness to lighten the load for the hard road ahead Come what may Because of what is being done today there is hope Everyone knows that this is a time for action Weve run out of road and everyone knows it No one wants change to come at their expense but there is no other way That is why Ive done what Ive done Despite what you might think I do not hate humanity On the contrary I love it I love it so much that Im willing to pay the check to preserve it I wish that I could cover the bill on my own After being sentenced to death for corrupting the youth of Athens Socrates one of the greatest thinkers and teachers of all time leaned over to his friend Crito and said Crito we owe a cock to the god Asklepios the greek god of healing Pay it and do not neglect it Then he drank hemlock and died I say to you that we also owe a sacrifice to the god of healing Let us pay it and not neglect it And so now as I drink my own hemlock literally I leave humanity feeling hopeful that our own healing has begun Dick

room gazing out the window at the darkening sky The beautiful colours of twilight had become a dull grey like how she felt within She hadnt seen her parents in what seemed days although the clock on the wall seems to indicate only a few hours ago They appeared to be forgetting that Charlie was alive and it hurt more than anything else As she descended into the kitchen her steps were marked by creaking wood which gave way under her feet that were bare Emma her mother stood with her back towards the entrance cooking supper Charlie paused outside the door hoping for acknowledgement from her mother but received none In the lounge Mark sat engrossed in his book unaware of Charlies presence Mom Dad called out Charlie with a tremor in her voice No answer came forth Inside anger boiled and frustration welled up inside her as she marched to the dining table and knocked over a glass sending it crashing onto the floor without even getting attention from them What is wrong with you Why dont you see me She screamed through house walls Yet there was no response at all She was boiling with anger and frustration She went to the dining table and hit it up against a glass that fell on the ground breaking into pieces Her mother jumped turning quickly Mark did you hear that she called out concern in her voice What was it Mark asked looking up from his book I think the glass fell over on its own Emma replied hurrying to the table She knelt down carefully picking up the shards Strange theres no breeze in here Charlie stood frozen watching her mother clean up the mess she had made Emmas face was a mix of confusion and sadness as if she was struggling with something deeper than a broken glass As her mother swept up the last of the shards Charlie felt a chill run down her spine Something was terribly wrong Whats your problem Dont you see me She shouted loudly and her voice reverberated all over the house However there was no response from them Her mother hummed a sad melody as her father proceeded to turn a page in his book without interruption Charlie felt coldness run down her spine something was terribly amiss On that night she hurried back into her room seeking answers In desperation she got out one of her old photograph albums intending to find some solace in happier times While flipping through pages she came across an image which made her heart skip beats It had been a photo of both of them standing by a grave their faces full of grief deepness etched on their faces Her name was engraved on the tombstone Charlotte Charlie Evans The truth hit her like a sledgehammer and she felt the rush of cold air She had died months ago The accidentit was all coming back to her now The car crash on that rainy night the blinding headlights the screeching tires She had been so sure she would make it home safely but she never did Her parents werent neglecting her they simply couldnt see her She was a ghost trapped in a world where she no longer belonged It was frightening and at the same time liberating when she realized what this meant for her life Her face was soaked with tears as the depth of grief in her parents heart and own tragic end unfolded to her Charlie determined to seek reconciliation decided to pay her respects at the grave A silence fell over the night as she trod through dark streets into the cemetery The mists were dense and there was a gentle wind in the trees The parents flowers were already withered on her headstone that stood under an old oak tree Next to the grave she kneeled down and put a hand on the cold rock I am sorry Mommy Daddy She apologized silently Now I know better than I did before I love you so much The first rays of sunrise brought mild heat around Charlies body At that moment she looked up and saw them standing by cemetery entrance holding hands with their faces white but unyielding They were here for her they came back to cry again Emma wiped away tears from her eyes as she placed some new flowers on the grave which sparkled in the morning sunshineWe miss you darlingshe murmuredEvery single day we miss you Charlie felt comforted he felt at ease with the world They stared at each other as she backed away from the TV and watched them silently celebrate their memory She knew that their love for her and conscience would continue to be as strong as the hearts beating This is the finest way to end it thought Charlie as she gazed at her parents one final time before drifting away for good She learned that she was never there alone she wasnt And as she closed her journey towards the light she again said goodbye because she knew that she was a part of all of them and that all of them are a part of her Upvote Downvote comments Is this story bullshit I cant tell Butcher it please Is this story

Romance It started with musing on my ideal romantic day a warm afternoon spent between cool sheets with a loving partner listening to our favorite records and singing our favorite songs hugging and kissing the day away Whatever came after would be irrelevant because we would still have that moment Then in a flash I realized this to be the focus the inception of the Church of Romance Partners and consenting adults would form our congregation and our holy relics would be a turntable and a pair of speakers The congregation would make offerings of their favorite pressed vinyls and services would proceed as described above preferably in a large open space with dozens of fresh mattresses The more zealous practitioners might imbibe psilocybin and cannabis to more fully experience the Sabbaths grandeur Worshippers would leave feeling refreshed and at peace ready to face the weeks rigors knowing the support of the community would be waiting for them For what could be more universal than love and music But my next thought was of how the Church would be perceived and eventually labeled Drugaddled perverted polygamous fornicators NewAge free love hippies with no real beliefs and no discernible benefit to God or country Then would come the forced disbandings public ostracization and the eventual crushing of the Churchs spirit and self And so the Church of Romance died as it had lived while I was listening to side A of Weezers Teal album Specifically while listening to their cover of Take On Me but ironically not during their cover of Happy Together Upvote Downvote comments Please help me find this story Please help me find this story It was a short story I read in a Best of 20xx I dont remember the exact date but pre2015 collection Its so memorable and I retell it to people now and again but I cant find it anywhere The name of the story is the name of the fictional Russian nightclub that serves as the setting as well as the legendary gangster who built it Story goes like this Russian gangsters the protagonist is the 2nd in command well call him P The Boss is taking him to a famous exotic nightclub but doesnt know P has saved up a ton of and is planning to leave the game for good with his exotic dancer girlfriend The club is named after another infamous old gangster who upon the clubs grand opening disappeared into it never to be seen again They enter the club into the main ballroom and take a seat at a fancy table before a central stage This level of the club is very posh filled with people of means P knows that every morning before the crowd turns over theres an auction on this stage where the most beautiful dancer presents the crowd with a single pristine red rose Its all show for the high rollers to show off how much money they can throw away but that rose is coveted nonetheless Ps boss introduces P to a suspicious associate and after the formalities P takes his leave to meet up with his girlfriend This is where the story begins to get psychedelic A floor down P meets his girl while shes working and takes a seat at a bar He orders 2 shots of the clubs house vodka also named after the mysterious og gangster who built the place After he takes the shots he finds himself eerily walking alone in a snowy frozen wooded park Suddenly the suspicious associate of his boss comes out of nowhere and attacks him ostensibly on the bosss orders Our P loses this violent fight to the death and as his eyes fade to black he wakes up at the bar again with 2 empty shot glasses in front of him Shaking off the intense dream P leaves the basement floor of the club to find someone he can pay his large sum of to to buy his womans freedom This journey takes him up an elevator this time and past a filthy and grotesquely emaciated janitor As P passes the janitor they lock eyes and in an instant P knows that this man is in fact in the flesh the owner of this club the infamous og himself With a silent and mangled grin the decrepit janitor reaches out a gnarled open hand toward P to receive the money P knows this moment is crucial but he hesitates when his sensibility demands a more formal transaction The moment passes the janitor turns back to his work P is forced to walk on angry and deeply disturbed down the hall to the next room of the club This floor has several rooms of themed masquerade and as P stumbles through them he finds himself talking to people he hasnt seen in ages Some are family and friends while some are old enemies of his After calming down from his encounter with the horrible remnant of the club owner he begins to realize that some of the people hes surrounded by should be dead Hes seen many of them die himself and yet here they are drinking and dancing the night away He flees the scene afraid he will somehow be stuck in that place of shambling walking dead until he feels snowflakes again on his face P is in the snowy park again but this time he knows the game The catandmouse game of death is Ps home territory and after the night hes had he is more than ready for it P stays in the treeline and waits for his assailant to reveal himself Soon enough his bosss new associate walks into the clearing completely unaware of P P sneaks up behind him and attacks this time with vengeful ferocity and the clear upper hand As he watches the light leave his assailants eyes all around him his surroundings dissolve into curtains that raise into the ceiling to the sound of thunderous applause and P finds himself in the main ballroom again center stage He notices his boss still seated at his original table laughing and clapping with a thoroughly entertained smile on his face P silently climbs offstage and sits back down with his boss He is just in time for the rose auction Lo and behold its Ps girlfriend on stage presenting the rose to the audience As she begins to take bids P sits exhausted and feels like this may be the last chance to buy freedom for him and his partner He stands and offers his entire briefcase of savings for the rose and not a single attendee will raise his offer She saunters over to him and says that this is it its over and everything is ready for them to leave in the morning She looks at him emotionless and says he had his chance to pay the owner and he made his choice to keep the money She takes the briefcase presents him with the rose and walks away P sits down again and time passes in a blur until his boss claps him on the shoulder and tells him its time to leave They go outside to the bosss limousine and P is left reflecting that after all that its back to work tomorrow after all Upvote Downvote comments Existencial dread Existencial dread Hello as you know youll die we dont know when or how Im here to ask is this really the life you wanted

Dago Wops finally got what was coming to them feel like they could run my city Phil said smirking Hey at least they dispose of the bodies so we dont have to deal with them right Phil Phil shot me another dirty look Shut up Mikey Just then we got a call on the radio a fourcar pileup about fifteen minutes away My eyes lit up Can we get this one Phil We wont make it kid let someone else get it He said pulling his hat back over his eyes Its 4 cars we can at least head that way to help Be my guest kid just get us there in one piece I hit the lights and sped off I needed some excitement Riding along with Phil all night tends to make for a dull shift The rain seemed to match my excitement and started to come down even more fierce than before I could feel the gust of wind challenging the speed of the ambulance swinging the back of the vehicle back and forth Slow down kid I looked over to tell Phil to relax when out of the corner of my eye a blue dress with white flowers in the middle of the road caught my eye I slammed on the brakes and jolted the steering wheel left trying to evade the blue sun dress The whole ambulance started to hydroplane followed by a loud thud sound on the side of the square ambulances shell I started to feel some resistance of the vehicle sliding while at the same time the tires tap dancing from being slightly lifted off the ground Finally we came to a complete stop I looked over and Phil was already out of the Rig Oh boy did you fuck up kid Phil belted out with amusement I met him on the other side of the ambulance to see him staring at a mangled body twisted a contorted The left arm was flush behind the upper body where the hand could be seen almost grasping the right shoulder The left shoulder bone was caved in where you would see what they call the broad of the shoulder Friction from the tire marks burned holes in to separate parts of the once skyblue dress The body was barely twitching I was stunned my brain was mush and my heart felt like it was in my stomach Grab the gurney and get me an extra sheet Phil barked I rushed to the back of the disheveled ambulance feeling relieved that Phil was taking the lead I grabbed the gurney and sheets and headed over to see Phil administering something into the womens vein in her arm then quickly putting the syringe back into a small black leather doctors bag What is that Phil I asked Come on lets get her on the gurney he snapped Phil rolled her lifeless body in the sheet as if he was rolling her into an area rug like you see in the movies I went to strap her in until Phil batted my hand away annoyingly Just get her in the back and start driving once loaded up Phil told me to stop if I see any cars on the side of the road About a mile down the road was a Colbert blue Volkswagen bug leaning forward in a ditch with the front end wrapped around a tree I pulled over Phil shouldnt we be calling this in or getting her to the hospital Wont do any good she has expired But she was twitching when we got to her I said with fading hope in my voice Yeah well I administered enough fentanyl to kill the most experienced junkie lets hope you hitting her did the trick so she does not wake up overdosing My eyes got big and I was immediately nauseous and confused at the same time You injected her with fentanyl But Why Do you want to explain what really happened here tonight Phil said half smirking You will be back flipping burgers or pressing license plates in the penitentiary if anyone finds out what you did Phil looked up at me with a stern but also opportunist look in his face You owe me one after tonight kid Phil unveiled the lifeless body from the sheets and laid the shattered body into the front seat of the car How is this going to pass off when her body has all those injuries I said hoping Phil would change his mind Phil looked at me and gave me another one of those smirks again only this one was more sinister before I knew it he grabbed the poor girl by the back of her head and smashed her face through the already cracked now shattered windshield The clear shattered glass started to bleed red before he pulled her back and slammed her face for a second time this time her face sticking to the windshield Her face was held on by every shard of glass penetrating her forehead and cheeks As I watched the blood splatter all over the windshield I could not help but to start vomiting I could hear Phil laughing behind me You ok kid You need me to drive I gathered myself and got back into the ambulance Drive a few miles up and find a new place to pull over and for fucks sake get us there with no bullshit Phil yelled I started down the road driving five under the speed limit You like your current job Mikey Phil said calmly I just nodded Good because you know if you mention this to anyone and I mean anyone that is the end of this and any other future job I was suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of anxiety at the thought of this Not to mention now I am dragged in to this too Thanks kid Phil II didnt mean too she just Oh just cut the sad boy crap it is what it is now Phil interrupted We are partners and partners cover for each other I mean youre not some fucking rat are you I shook my head no Good cause you got a lot to lose in this situation yourself Pull over here Phil said pointing to a dim lit billboard advertising Blairstown diner Whats with the black bag Phil Phil just stared at me for a moment before taking his hat off and running his hand through his sweaty salt and peppered colored hair Well that depends I can tell you but what I tell you has to stay in this ambulance just like what happen here tonight needs to I just nodded again Lets just say it is my way of showing the world and the suffering mercy I was going to ask Phil what he meant by that when the call came over the radio Dispatch 243 We both just looked at each other Dispatch 243 Phil nodded annoyingly signifying me to answer the call Copy this is 243 We got a call for a blue Volkswagen crashed into a tree in your area Bystanders waiting by patients Requesting medical attention for one female patient twenty to twentyfive years old I sat there with my mind paused still looking at Phil Phil on his last nerve with me gestured with his hands for me to proceed with the call Getting my bearings back I said Copy that 243 in route Better get your shit together before we got on scene Act like you been there before without acting like you have been there before Phil said letting out the most genuine laugh I had ever heard him make I glared at him in disgust for a split second before hitting the lights and heading to the mess I made Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments My girlfriend cheated on my dad My girlfriend cheated on my dad Upvote Downvote comments Dehqan 1 mo ago Dehqan It wasnt the stink you knowI get how months out in the field can mess with a fellas cleanliness but the look on his face was like he was fixin to puke as if he was sick or caught a whiff of somethin dead close by Squirters had some clue about what went down that night in Kandahar but I wasnt about to let this joker mess up my chance for a hot shower and a decent meal I sure wish Id listened to the ganner truth be told I aint had a proper night since then All I member of his face these days Some context anything to keep me awake at this point I dropped in shit lake 2006 just fore the surge The name came from the literal pit of human waste left open to the air they dont tell you about it before you get on the 17 and they laugh their ass off when the doors first open Made your eyes water and the smell stayed with you for weeks Once we got used to it we followed suit fuckin wit everyone else who hadnt had the pleasure Came te be a rite of passage whether ye came on a bird or a moose Id been there a month and it was getting stale I couldnt taste anything at chow most days anyway and I spent so much time on circuit in the gun that I dont member much about the pond anymore these days fuck Brass suited me with a terp they thought I knew the lay no one fuckin did always gonna be another flash on the road no matter how many times you been down it Tried to tell em but butters aint got the sense te light a cig much less listen to a grunt Anyway I get this guy named Ali never membered his last name didnt care so many angels dropped cause terps were workin both sides the rifle aint gonna put my trustn one if I get my say but I still get orders and the brig aint away from th smell I hear its gone now but my boots still have the memory in the summer Ali spoke English er his version of it I could understand em if he talked slow and didnt keep is mouth open too long mujs aint heard a mouthwash neither He was posed to introduce us te people that we could link up aint got nothing te do with me and the serpentine stopped every jingle not up te play nice so far so I let em dois job Met up with Hekmat Ali said he was an uncle but all these ganners got some kind of cousin thing going on so it didnt mean nothin Esaid that we was in the birthplace of the Taliban made me kinda warmn that I was being as much a thorn in their ass as they were in ours but Hekmat said Argandab was gonna be quiet the next few nights but he wouldnt say why just said the word dehqan tween the two of them a word Ali didnt translate for us I had been picking up a little Pashto while I was there it meant landowner or farm crew boss I could tell however by the way he said it it didnt mean farmer I could smell a setup a mile away so I thought Ali was gonna rabbit and leave me and my guys into an ambush but intel was intel maybe I could get bagram for the weekend if I found a nest a muqs I wasnt gonna be picky getting off the lake as we was calling it On the gun back to base Ali said we had to wait until morning that were we was going wasnt gonna be safe til then I looked back at my TL Scott and he just shook his head aint no way we was waitin til mornin Scott called back te base saying we was checking something out it was gonna go it with the NOD and we was gonna make sure nothing was coming in from the north we find something the drone could paint it and put some heat on our mujs fore they was ready We got off the horn and Ali looked nervous I asked em what he was afraid of we was in the safest way to travel in the area and we was just lookin but Ali was insistent that we not go north not tonight I was determined more than ever and I aint been wrong yet He said that there were things about his country we just didnt understand that it would be best to wait til mornin I asked him if it was because of the Dehqan His face went pale as I mentioned it he swallowed deep We aint afraid of no farmers Aladdin The six of us in the gun laughed but Ali said nothing He just sat there the fear of the situation beginning to sink in As the sun dipped below the horizon night crept quick over the valley makin them caves stretch longer and deeper til they gulped down all the sand and moondust blanketing the whole area The night dragged on our convoy cuttin through the Afghan dark like a blade through black velvet The moon tucked behind them rugged mountain peaks threw a dim spooky light across the land As we pushed deeper into the north the chill in the air bit harder and you could feel the tension buildin up amongst the boys Ali was about near his breakin point His eyes kept flickin to the shadows that hugged the rocks and gullies along the road Every little sound had him jumpin and that jitteriness was catchin sending ripples of nerves through the whole convoy I was tryin my best to keep steady but Alis scare was infectious The air was so tense felt like you could slice it open with a bayonet I tried to crack the tension hollerin over to him Whats got you jumpin Ali Youd think you just seen a ghost or somethin He shook his head mumbling something about bad omens and cursed lands It was then that a peculiar smell wafted through the air a mix of decay and something wild a scent that didnt belong Damn Ali if youre that scared you couldve just said so instead of lettin one rip I joked forcing a laugh that sounded more hollow than I intended The boys gave a weak chuckle but the laughter didnt last none choked out by the thick air and the quiet understandin that the smell was somethin elsesomethin none of us could pin down My heart missed a beat The scent werent human or animal it was somethin old somethin that whispered of the earth and decay Alis eyes widened and he whispered fiercely It is not me sir It is them The Dehqan The stench got thicker tellin us clear as day we werent alone no more The jokin stopped dead swapped out for the click of safeties comin off and the sound of tight nervous breathin The boys were on edge scannin the dark fingers glued to their triggers senses stretched to the max The convoy slowed down some drivers takin it careful as that heavy scent wrapped around us thick and chokin We was miles from any sorta safety way out in the middle anothing where anythin could be livin but that smellit was tellin us there was somethin out there somethin downright alienI glanced at Ali his face pale in the dim light of the vehicles dashboard Talk to me Ali What are we dealing with He swallowed hard his voice a whisper torn straight from nightmare The Dehqan they guard the night They are the night We should not have come he shrieked pulling at his ears and trying to hide from the deep darkness in the cabin Before I could press him further the radio crackled to life breaking the tension for a moment Top movement up aheadlarge unidentifiable The NOD tracked heat and lowlight features and at the moment it was the only things that illuminated the road the readout was clear somethin was there My eyes shot to Ali as he nodded and covered his head as though that would do anything The ground started shakin just a tad at first like the earth itself was just tossin in its sleep Then them shakes got stronger rhythmic and purposeful sendin a low rumble through the air that you could feel in your bones tellin every man in the convoy somethin huge was movin in the dark just past the beam of our gear As them thuds got nearer my boys clamped down on their weapons bodies all tensed up braced for whatever might come Ali though he looked near bout ready to break apart all them earlier words of his bout things we couldnt understand like them Dehqan echoin in my head Scott was peering through the NOD his voice comin over the radio soft and raspy Contact Big really big His voice just dropped off into that kinda silence that takes over when youre starin down somethin you never imagined youd see Out of the darkness figures began to emergeDehqans titans silhouetted against the night Each of their steps made the earth beneath our boots tremble a slow rhythmic thud echoing through the air like the beat of an ancient drum They stood as tall as trees at least 25 feet at the short end Massive yet with no apparent malice their faces bore a detached curiosity reminiscent of a traveler pondering a line of ants on a trek Night vision counted seven but the dim headlights of our convoy only illuminated two with any clarity These were not men not people as we could have understood them but something else something beyond As they approached a palpable tension filled the air thicker than fog One of them moved by a childlike curiosity reached outa gesture so disarmingly naive Its finger the size of a log gently tapped the side of the lead Humvee The impact was soft yet it sent a shudder through the fourton vehicle Metal groaned under the strain the drivers door buckling inward the windshield spiderwebbing as if struck by a boulder Vasquez was at the wheel the look on his face one of incomprehension as the life was literally crushed out of him Johns and Askew in the back screameda raw primal sound of terror that seemed to startle the giant Reacting as if stung it swatted the Humvee The vehicle was no match it crumbled as though it were made of paper the 50 Cal snapping bending backward with a shriek of tearing metal Then came the silencea suffocating oppressive silence that enveloped us all Inside that twisted metal coffin three lives were extinguished without warning without a chance to fight back We the survivors stood frozen our weapons rendered absurd in our hands our training useless The air was thick with the smell of oil and blood a stench that would stick to our clothes and haunt us forever I looked around at my troops their faces etched with shock and disbelief This was no ordinary horror no simple brutality of war This was a grotesque display of our own fragility a harsh reminder of our insignificance against beings so colossal so alien The notion of retaliation flickered through my mind a brief irrational spark quickly extinguished by reality What were our rifles against such enormity Against such ignorance of our very existence It was futile a tragic farce The Dehqan its face twisting with what seemed like regret didnt understand what it had done It hadnt intended to kill it probably didnt even grasp what death meant to us But that small comfort did little to ease the sting of our loss This moment this horrifying lesson would replay in my mind for the rest of my life It wasnt just outside the normit was beyond the realm of human understanding taught by a being that didnt even realize it was a teacher Alis voice barely a whisper cut through the tense silence They do not see us as threats We are too small too insignificant But their paths are theirs alone we must not block them Like Alis words were gospel the Dehqan kept to their slow roll their huge shapes breezing past our convoy without so much as a sideeye They trooped with a smoothness that didnt match their bulk melting back into the black they came from as quiet as they showed up After the dustup the convoy was dead still everyone silent as the creatures passed Wehad to chew on thfact that their iron and drills wouldnt have meant squat to those massive shadows It was a real gutcheck a slap in the face of our own smallness in a sandbox that hid secrets way older and bigger than any of us couldve figured After that brush with the Dehqan the first light of dawn felt like a bit of a breather but it didnt last none Rolling back into base the silence in the convoy wasnt just quietit was heavy like a thick blanket squashing any attempt at normal jawing The minute we passed the gate the S6 crew was all over us Assignments and classifications officers lined up pokerfaced like the mountains wed just left behind My team spilled what wed seen every last detail but it was like talking to a dang wall They wrote it all down only to bury it deep in the classified files Ali disappeared in the shuffle went down a different hall and I dont even wanna know where hes stuck staring at the ceiling but I know he aint sleepin aint none of us sleeping sound Thanks for the intel Sergeant one of the brass hats drawled voice flat as a pancake But we gotta see this from what it might mean to moralefor your safety and the missions Typical brasssittin on secrets that could blow up in everyones face not givin ahshit who gets hurt Grunts we aint big on secrets we keep em cause were used to brass playing their games and throwing the board when they didnt win but this was another level Knowing about them giants out there who didnt even see us as a blip on their radar it kinda shrinks you Makes you see just how tiny your spot in the big picture really is To them we were less threatening than the dust our trucks kicked up They shipped me off with a fat pension said Id been blown up that my thinker wasnt right no more Same deal for my crewall discharged under every excuse in the book shell shock health snags you name it We tried to talk about what wed seen but all we got were shrugs and more pills and yammering about dehydration or heatstroke All bull I know what I seen and they seen us toonot as threats or even somethin to mull over More like how youd spot a leaf driftin down a creek just passin by here for a sec and then gone That kind of thing sticks with you It changes you knowin theres things out there so big so indifferent Sittin here now years later that night is still as clear as crystal Them giants up in the hills the smell of ancient earth the sound of their stepsa deep echoin thud thats still ringin in my bones Theyre out there walkin paths we cant even start to wrap our heads around keepin secrets that aint meant for us to know No matter how hard the top brass tries to bury it or how many times they say we were just seein things that night under the stars with the Dehqan was the darnedest realest thing Ive ever laid eyes on They didnt just send me packin with a pension they tried to silence a truth too mighty to squeeze into their tidy little records But you cant unsee them faces the eyes the everythin of it all and you cant shake off the feeling of being totally utterly insignificant Not really Not sure if any yall even give this a listen think thiss real but we better hope they just keep seeing us as ants I dont think theres anything we got thatll even shake the shit off their boots much less hurt em Upvote Downvote comments The Feather 1 mo ago The Feather I mean didnt really have a choice He stated staring at Jackie Did you Unblinking Jackie attempted to stare back into his eyes but Wavered Shaken Unsure Small Finally Jackie managed to blurt out a No The man who was speaking him smiled his demeanour remaining coiled ready Exactly The two men sat in a car in the middle of the garbage dump surrounded by mounds and monuments of discard and debris A seemingly inconspicuous place but to Jackie felt like the centre of a black hole With Franks nonsmile right in the centre Pointed right at him like the tip of a sword The weight of what Jackie was being told began to sink in Frank was pressing the weight of his authority onto him with nothing but a word and a look He realised that in this exchange he was the dog and Frank the leash He had been working for Frank for 3 years now and in the London Metropolitan Police Service for 5 Months before this he was Franks star pupil right hand man If Frank wanted a coffee Jackie was the man who got it He started to think about where hed put a foot wrong where hed made a mistake If this was it truly the end Then what was it all for Hed passed on some information to his superiors but nothing solid enough to convict Hed taken this role as his personal project to prove that he stood for Law Order no matter the price If he had to get his hands dirty in the process then dirty hands he shall have Now what did he have to show for it A widow an orphan and a job half done Hey is everything ok Frank asked Jackie snapping him out of his internal spiralling conversation He looked at Jackie with roughly 10 more concern in his face and 20 more in his voice than necessary Yeah yeah of course Replied Jackie obediently Petrified Falling Abyss Obliteration Long as I know you didnt mean it Ah no harm done init Eh Do me a favour and take me home will you said Frank relaxing back into the passenger seat and looking forward his entire demeanour softening as he gazed disinterested out the window Jackie blinked He did his best to not let his immediate total relief show But he was absolutely not believing what he was hearing Take me home did he just hear that right He must have because he was sitting there as if he had just been told the proverbial court case had dropped and he was going to walk free which was alarmingly close to the truth No worries Boss he said coolly and began to drive the car out of the lot They drove quietly for what felt like 10 or so thousand hours At one point Jackie almost spoke but instead elected to turn on the radio Which Frank responded to by changing the station This was nothing out of the ordinary Frank liked to be in control of the radio They drove for a few minutes before Frank finally broke the silence Pull in here I wanna take a piss He said gesturing generally to the side of the road staring directly out the window not looking at Jackie Jackie hesitated Scanned Calculated Scared He pulled in Frank did largely as he said he would do he got out of the car Walked into a brush on the side of the road unzipped himself and took a piss A rather large one at that Jackie found himself noticing As Frank began to walk back to the car Jackie felt a sense of unease a sense of being watched To accurately state it a sense that someone was in the back seat he neglected to check out of anxiety about to shoot him Jackie panicked thought about whether to check out of panic and risk Frank seeing him crack or to calculate whether it was even worth it to check or not If hes dead hes dead He didnt check Frank got back into the car his very large mass weighing the car back down as he sat himself back in it with some effort Jackie also couldnt help but notice You enjoy the show Frank asked staring at Jackie blankly What was all Jackie managed to stammer out Eyeing me up and down like im a fucking tart while ive me lad out Fucks all that about Frank pressured Jackie here Jackie could feel it The slight difference in aggression gave him away it wasnt assertive it was rage he was baiting him Jackie thanked every god he had ever seen or heard of for his police training in that very moment He acted without thinking then his training doing the legwork He laughed Frank hesitated looked at Jackie for a second as Jackie continued to laugh hysterically A few seconds passed with his laughter punctuating the silence Jackie rocking the frame of the car with his shaking Frank abruptly responded by laughing even louder his booming positively jolly tone seeming to rattle the car windows The weight of choice and oblivion leaving the air more and more with every exaggerated Ha Ha Ha coming from Franks chest Jackie was safe he could taste it The relief washed over him You almost had me you old fucker Jackie said slapping Frank twice on the thigh Which wouldnt have been out of the ordinary Im only windin you up son Come on get me back home like a good lad said Frank Jackie started the car again and drove the pleasant route home from the junkyard Taking in the scenery of the small London borough in which they secured their little empire He watched the houses and trees and gardens flick by the drivers window as he drove He couldnt help but feel pride conflicting pride He was just short of admitting to Frank that he was a policeman and that he had been undercover so they could share a laugh that Jackie had gotten one over on the old man He identified within himself that was his familiarity to Frank almost betraying him again Like the time in Glasgow he needed to be more careful of that Jackies thoughts drifted off slightly as he stopped Checking both sides of the intersection before taking off down the alleyway It led down a small road which led again to a large industrial estate that they had sometimes used for merchandise assembly As he waited he began to think of his childhood What would become of his own child Were something to happe Bang Black Glass Cracked Goo Red They never fucking check the back seat do they Dean Fucking oblivious said Frank mildly irritated betraying his own pain He liked Jackie No they dont Guv replied Dean obediently who had been in the back seat up until this point hidden underneath the bottom of the passengerside foot space This space served well for this sort of thing Lots of roads no one around Dean was cleaning blood from his very old very notstylish spectacles Frank threw his head back he couldnt betray his facade really but he liked Jackie Truly and honestly He allowed himself an uncharacteristically long sigh which caught Deans attention Take me home Deano Yes Guv he responded Frank found in that moment two things he was getting old and it embarrassed him Secondly that he preferred Boss to Guv Seeking Feedback Upvote

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrWpTTlgqqxQt9s Upvote Downvote comments Dark mansion 1 mo ago Dark mansion We had been driving for four hours when we saw the sign for a small hotel and decided to stop It was already dark outside It had been pouring since the very beginning of our trip lightning was cutting the sky we were tired and could hardly see the road so there was no reason to continue our journey We turned from the highway to a country road but the hotel was nowhere to be found We had been driving for a long time along the country road we were exhausted and nearly fought with each other when the frightening silhouette of an old dark mansion suddenly appeared in front of us Is it here What a creepy place I thought it would be a small family hotel I looked anxiously at my husband The mansion looked uninhabited WellIt does look creepy but Im really tired and I need a rest he answered tiredly and we all walked together towards the Victorian house Having opened the massive oak door we felt a stale smell of dampness and dust but it was warm there and the record with music from the late 50s was playing quietly I could also hear the wood crackling in the fireplace but the fireplace itself and the record player were not visible We had been wandering around the hall and looking at old portraits on the walls when I noticed a very old calendar from 1958 I wanted to take a closer look at it but suddenly out of nowhere a man in a tailcoat with a small sloppy bow tie appeared in front of me Afterwards I kept trying to remember his face but I just couldnt He silently directed me to go to the reception desk where my husband and my sister with her husband had been waiting for me for some time Where have you been for so long We are tired and want to get into a warm bed my sister began to get annoyed But just a minute ago we were all looking at the house I was interrupted by the silent receptionist who with a gesture hurried us up to our rooms The whole situation and atmosphere in the mansion gradually gave rise to anxiety in me The receptionist gave us two small rooms on the second floor and quickly left My husband fell asleep as soon as touched the pillow but I couldnt sleep I think he had been watching his tenth dream when I suddenly heard footsteps in the corridor I thought that maybe my sister in the next room couldnt sleep either When I approached the door I was horrified to discover that the door was open although I had closed it and there was no one in the corridor I had hardly convinced myself that it was just wind and at the same moment our window swung open with a loud creak My heart nearly stopped and started beating as if it would burst out of my chest When I found the strength and went to the window I discovered that it was completely calm outside There was no wind no thunderstorm only a dark night a lonely moon and the ominous silhouette of a dead man at the edge of the forest incredibly similar to our receptionist I started screaming and crying from what my husband woke up terribly scared I told him and my sister that this house was cursed and the receptionist was actually a ghost but no one believed me I tried to persuade them to leave this place right away and in the end they agreed When we were leaving the hotel there was no one at the reception the weather had calmed down and dawn was beginning We reached our destination the next day but this story haunted me or rather the fact that everyone still didnt believe in the damned mansion A few days later on our way back during the daytime we decided to look for this mansion one more time but we never found it Upvote Downvote comments The Call Part One Follower 1 mo ago The Call Part One Follower The day the world plunged into darkness was the day I found my light I can never say that I have lived an authentic life No I hold myself to no such illusion I spent my days to the ungodly hours toiling in my cubicle and squandered my turpid existence in insubstantiality and other means of escape while the planet churned deteriorating in its wayward axis Even in that I dont think myself unique Just another cog in the machine whose purpose I know not Even the memories I have of my childhood all seemed insignificant even false As if I was a frail apparition projecting from the thin and fragile film of an unremarkable past But as the glass of fate ruptured in the great cataclysm deforming our collective imagination of the world and its destiny so did a beacon rise coaxing forth legions of soulless beings such as myself It happened alongside the birthing of the Dragon from the heavens Burning rocks rained down upon civilization shattering lives and orphaning dreams One such form crashed upon my street Fear struck me as it did everyone But from this stone that came from the sky echoed a call that so helplessly entranced me With my hand wounded by a shard I aimed to touch this now seeming monument And as I drew near it glowed with ripples of flames like singed paper on its obsidian surface tracing out glyphs I hardly understood but whose meaning plucked at every fabric of my being The touch was both electric and scorching It cauterized my wound and permeated deep within myself imparting me with a singular purpose But I never had a will of my own and I still did not possess such even as I stepped onto the path the glowing scar on my hand directed me I was being called By whom I did not know To what end my reasoning escaped me Yet I followed venturing through the ruins left by the Wyrms terrible wings and hellish breath Although my travail only proved extremely harsh and deadly my newfound aim allowed me to suffer neither the paralyzing dread that has stricken every heart nor any severe injury that could have otherwise incapacitated me My embattled journey pitted me against countless foes spawned in the dragons arrival But be them monsters or men I cared little what manner of being I had to slay with whichever bladed and blunted weapon I can fashion While humanity wept and cowered hiding away gnashing and grieving I climbed the fallen remnants of modernity like peaks of majestic mountains braving the evils that stalk the skies the land and the waters Only to find you My Master Ascendant youre such a sight to behold Finding you is as liberating even as it binds me for all eternity at your side You the one whose heart the dragon stole The one who swore to bring an end to this tyranny I swear to you my whole life Every talent that I have will be used in the service of your cause Let me suffer a million cuts and a hundred thousand deaths if doing so will bring you a step closer to the fulfillment of all our destiny Ascendant my Master I a pawn among your legion will march with you

cup and then place it on the counter Slightly annoyed Mark looked around Elsinore Station coffee shop But for the view outside it wouldnt be hard to mistake the place for a small Starbucks back on old Terra Firma Espresso machines spitting out steam like suddenly disturbed pit bulls A small homemade batch of probably tasty pastries under a glass surface A few metal tables sporting metal chairs with blue plastic rectangles for backs three of which were occupied by what looked like super tall college students staring hard into their laptops fat headphones covering most of their heads But then there was the view Instead of an urban intersection with cars waiting for their light to turn Uranus Big pale green Uranus Mark remembered the feelings hed had when he was a kid back in Philadelphia looking up at those tall buildings Or looking down from milehigh ComcastMeta One the head spinning eyes watering vertigo That experience does not prepare you for being face to face with a planet floating in the deep black of space Uranus The butt of all juvenile jokes It was too big to all fit in one viewport When Mark walked right up to the viewport and smashed his face against it he could still only barely make out the right limb of the planet As he watched that limb slowly migrated up the rim of the viewport and for a moment Mark could almost feel himself rotating downward while the planet stayed still But only for a moment The SNEEZE SPIT HISS of an espresso machine brought his attention back to what tall Uranus girl was doing She had already placed the paper filter into the steel funnel and filled it with those sweet semicoarse grounds and was just starting to pour the scalding water Mark watched the thin stream of dark joy snake from the bottom of the cone down into his cup For a few moments Mark could almost convince himself that the drip of coffee followed a straight line instead of the slightly antispinward curved arc that all falling objects followed on a rotating space station And those few moments brought his imagination back to when he first tried the coffee from Miranda Mark are you getting all this Mark wrenched his eyes away from the pale green plastic canister that had arrested his attention and looked at a display of various video feeds and metrics Mark certainly had not been getting this Uh sorry what Mark yelled Windy RogersChan one of

clearly Ccard is gone and was missing before Alex opened the panel Thanks Mark replied Windy Back to work pal Mark considered the issue First the damage was easily repairable since their ship carried a stock of all the regular cards Second more importantly this is now the third L4 job where theyd run into a missing Ccard These things dont fall out on their own Maybe the manufacturer forgot to install it or a previous fix team forgot to replace it But then the laser would fail to stay aligned from the get go A more likely cause was that someone removed it on purpose But wasnt it hard to think clearly about a Solar Systemwide ring of satellite saboteurs when you havent had your coffee yet Mark hadnt had coffee in three Earth days The coffee maker was broken and needed new parts to function Marks team could fix any problem on a laser communication satellite but couldnt fix the coffee maker Mark absolutely thirsted for coffee Especially for some dark roasted Miranda which he had never tasted before yet sat perfectly ground in that pale green canister he was holding with both hands Miranda coffee beans A long growth low field variety On Earth coffee is grown high in the mountains The higher up you can grow it but still remain below freezing the denser the bean Denser beans like those from Ethiopia or Columbia are the sweetest and most acidic And also the most coveted Growers had tried reproducing those conditions in controlled environments on Earth but with mixed results There was something about being high up that produced fantastic beans which included sharp swings in temperature low pest pressures intense light and lower oxygen content but also something else A je ne sais qua that advantaged those Colombian and Ethiopian farmers It may have been that those beans just wanted to get outside the Earths protective geomagnetic field Because oh did the flavor profiles expand once we started growing coffee in space The first offplanet cultivars were grown on the Moon by American colonists The taste may not have been as delicious as the best Ethiopian brew but the profile was so significantly different that Lunar Beans became a bit of a delicacy sought after by terrestrial connoisseurs Today we know that coffee beans respond differently to all growing locations in the Solar System Botanists still dont understand the exact configuration of conditions that produce these novel flavor profiles but it seems that as long as the farmer is skilled at growing the bean the taste is governed by the geometric position of the growing bean relative to the Sun and other celestial bodies The job would take another hour or two to complete as Mark imagined what those beans would become once brewed As Mark tasted the anticipated sweetness of the coffee he fantasized about various brew methods On Earth he could just grab a French press and brew the perfect carafe He could almost see the 175 F water being poured into the dry grounds watching them swirl and dance as the carafe filled Or maybe a cone filter watching the dark soil rise to the top while the pot below filled with the black ichor a pungent odor wafting into his nostrils Hell Mark would use a regular drip coffee maker or even Heaven forbid a percolator at this point Anything Mark heard Windy rattling off some description but he wasnt listening He was staring at that pale green canister Imagining which fruits he would taste after getting hit with that first acidic sweetness Enough The only thing Mark was missing here was gravity There was an old cone drip funnel down in the mess hall which they used while the ship was accelerating between planets Instead of dripping into a mug Mark could use one of the old NASA space cups Colloquially dubbed the pussy cup by some guys in the laser communication mechanics union it had been designed over a hundred years ago to hold coffee while in freefall using the liquids adhesive properties But it did look like a cross between a squids backside a vagina and a rustic teapot Mark snapped the magnetic bottom of the can to the stainless steel console and leaped towards the hatch He passed through three more portals before arriving at the mess hall It was quite sparse on the surface and looked like any other floor But the cabinets held all kinds of food stuffs packaged in varieties of plastic bags tubes and cans Enough to sustain a crew of three for many months in space It also housed supplies like the steel coffee funnel micropore cone filters measuring cups liquid syringes and of course some pussy cups He strung the setup to a big mommy hook clipped it to a strap on his pants and hurried back up to the command deck Once there he carefully arranged everything sitting normal to the forward panel Cup coffee funnel cone filter Then he placed the measuring cup water tube and coffee can lovingly next to the apparatus Finally he programmed the ships computer to run a series of maneuvers that would last ten minutes before returning exactly to the current position Mark got into position finger hovering over the GO button Suddenly remembering his crew out in the harsh black of space he checked their stats and their image in the cameras All good Uh guys dont be alarmed Im going run a test on Banshees side thrusters Should only take about ten minutes In the video feed Mark saw Windy freeze Mark She was staring into the camera now eyes digging deep into Marks conscience What are you doing Its OK wont take long Dont worry Marks finger hit GO At first it was hard to tell anything was happening But then Mark started to feel pressure on his body as he got pressed gently against the front panel The ship had started to tumble end over end slowly gaining rotational speed When Mark felt enough pressure he started to smile and popped open the coffee can The most wonderful symphony of smells burst into the atmosphere Cherry lime lilac oak Mark almost cried as he carefully spooned grounds into the cone filter When the ship got up to speed he began to pump steaming water over the coffee Then Mark started feeling dizzy Mark what the fuck are you doing he heard Windy ask The first drips came down from the funnel They didnt come down straight but in a clear arc splashing onto the panel next to the flesh colored cup Getting dizzier Mark pushed the cup under the stream and continued to fill the funnel with water The dizziness grew quickly and then gave way to nausea Mark sat next to the makeshift coffee setup and tried to be still while adding hot water to the cone The ship was at full spin now Mark could hear his crew yelling angry words through the intercom but he was concentrating so hard on watching the coffee drip down and on holding back puke that he could no longer parse the meaning of the words The stream of coffee bent very strongly in the antispinward direction Mark thought back to the warnings that all rotating space stations had on the way from hub to rim that warned newcomers to move slowly at first or risk sickness Mark always thought it was because of the disorientation animal confusion brought on by the eyes perceiving the odd motion of objects outside the station But now watching the arc of brewed coffee he though of the juices sloshing around in his own head trying their best to follow their freefall geodesic paths as Mark moved up and down turned his head moved his arms around And that only made the nausea worse Finally the coffee neared the top of the pussy cup so Mark stopped adding water He could feel the ship begin to slow its spin and prepared to be weightless again The strong aroma of nutty dark fruits still filled the cabins atmosphere and Marks nostrils but the sensation was no longer pleasant As the ship slowed to a halt coming again to its former rest position Mark reached for the cup He could now make out what Windy and Alex were yelling various descriptions of what violent things they would do to him when they got back in the ship Mark ignored these mundane unpleasantries as much as his pounding ears would allow and brought the object of his toil to his lips And then he barfed Bart The baristas voice jolted Mark out of his imagination out of the past As he grabbed the white cup he mumbled The names MARK Oh sorry said the smiling gawky girl Hey be careful its really hot Sure thanks Mark said with a smile as he turned back to the table he had claimed near that expansive porthole He sat down and popped the plastic lid off the cup and watched the pent up steam waft upwards toward the ceiling vaguely intending to arc antispinward Then he turned his attention back to the coffee Oh Miranda So perfect and so peerless are created Of every creatures best Mark lifted the cup to his nose took a deep breath and let the intoxicating odor fill his soul Then he took a sip Ow Goddamn That coffee sure was hot Mark put the cup on the table and looked back out the window at Uranus Once you burn your tongue thats it You cant unburn it Upvote Downvote comments A Weight of Unimaginable Consequence a short story by Outlanders FYI discusses suicide 1 mo ago A Weight of Unimaginable Consequence a short story by Outlanders FYI discusses suicide Suicide thankfully is a decision that carries the weight of not only ones life but ones future Strangely enough it isnt an easy choice to make one way or the other Due to the nature of the question those who would contemplate it are almost always leaning a certain way The choice to live is defined by things People places hobbies feelings and above all the possibility for things to improve Suicide would mean leaving everyone one has ever know everything one has ever done and all the things that would happen in the future It would mean leaving a trail of shattered lives following ones departure as countless people agonize over the inevitable thoughts that follow such a tragedy The thoughts of blame of sadness frustration anger powerlessness emptiness A decision of such magnitude it often poses the very same question the victim struggled with to all that were affected Despite all the terrible things that would happen if one chose suicide it does offer a single thing that nothing else in the universe is capable of giving An end No responsibilities no negative emotion nothing Ever again This end to oneself is so horrifyingly alluring The horror of suicide comes from the primal part of oneself that wishes to stay alive no matter what put up against the more intelligent part of oneself The very question suicide poses are ones mind attempting to convince one to die An attempt to make a decision on its own and thus forcing oneself to either fight ones own mind atop the inherent struggle of a situation that would lead to such contemplations or to succumb to the peaceful tranquility of nothing and no one To look up towards ones future or down towards the end one so desperately wishes for Today I choose to look up however there are many harder days ahead of me Upvote Downvote comments Ever Since I Was A Little Kid a random short story contains loredump 1 mo ago Ever Since I Was A Little Kid a random short story contains loredump Ever since I was a little kid I struggled to make friends Perhaps its because I look a bit intimidating with the red eyes dark hair and a voice quite deep for someone with a dolllike face Some of the kids wished to have such features as it would make them look mysterious but at the same time they despised others who have them those red eyes and dark hair Perhaps its because I cant fit in with the others sort of Again while most made fun of me for my looks they wish to have at least one or two people cared for me They would do group projects with me and bought vanilla milk from the vending machine outside of school But these same one or two people would move to another school after some time I had never managed to get in contact with them even if one of them would send me a few printed photos of her fluffy rabbits with funny notes at the back before she stopped sending a few years ago and my mailbox had been a bit empty And then I had to deal with some ostracizing and unwanted teasings And no the teachers are even worse When I was a little kid I got straight As and later on got a few Bs to full on Cs Many of them wondered why Id gone so low when I was struggling with life and Im kidding when I say studying is a chore to me Id do little feet taps and sometimes Id get lost in my mind but then its because studying was that boring The urge to get back to my bed and doodle some of the cringiest meme material urgh I just I just I wish I could be a person A person everyone likes Yeah I have a typical sad backstory In short I have no one I guess I have my parents But then my father has passed away and my mother is sick Both of them carry diseases and both of these diseases are genetic Still Im still alive and well but I dont know when I could live up to the life I want

quiet even grotesque truth in the trees I am both happy and disturbedperhaps even disgustedthat I am alive today You see Im a musician one who prefers more sophisticated music But on this day I was just going for a stroll Whenever I hear music I am entranced It has been that way since I was a babe Beware lest you make the same mistake Behind the tree line as the leaves begin to blot out the sun and the woodland creatures begin to peer at you queerly you must be careful Quiet even Perhaps you should heed the advice and never be there at all There was this tune a silly little tune but my ears were in love and my heart was curious Was this a woman Perhaps a soulmate I thought to myself How embarrassed I am to recall I followed this tune the type that makes you want to dance But as I got closer my skin began to crawl the hairs on my neck stood and I began to feel I should turn back But you see I am a man of logic A man of science What ridiculous thing could I be scared of but my own imagination The air was moist and smelled of the berries that grew here The wind blew the leaves in a rhythmic fashion Why its following the tune itself For a moment I thought Yet I shook the feeling again The bushes shook with both wind and the scampering of little creatures of all types A fox crawled from a rabbit hole and scurried into the thicket Even the birds stopped singing to listen to the tune I found myself feeling dizzy certainly due to exhaustion or dehydration I was never good about drinking enough water Thats how I rationalized the spell that had already been placed upon me No I drew closer and my heart tried to run the other way a tug of war for the soul Always listen to your soul for I did not I could see that there was a clearing ahead As I approached my eye caught some toadstools and as I looked around I noticed the fungal friends surrounded me in but a circle I laughed to myself coincidences have always entertained me I continued to the clearing Once I arrived my heart jumped to my throat my eyes watered and dried my blood turned to tar It was against nature the laws that man had set into place It was an abomination I immediately questioned myself the sciences the stars even God There was an atrocity before my eyes and I knew not what to do The dances they made were inhuman but that is due to them being far from human Something familiar yet at this moment alien I knew better than to scream I fought not to faint and the urge to vomit When you see the unknowable the unthinkable things that seem simple in thought until you encounter them in life I stopped myself from doing these ridiculous things as these things I dont want to call them rabbits or hares They are but demons in disguise I told myself It was more comforting to me than the tribe of longeared creatures I saw Yes just demons They danced around a fire playing an instrument made from the flesh of creatures which appeared to me alien though it may have been but an amalgamation Their pipes blew and the fire danced These wouldbe cute rabbits created an instinctual fear within me Flight fight or freeze my adrenaline told me Certainly I was not going to fight and the urge to flee would not come Commanding each individual muscle fiber to move I began to retreat keeping my eyes on the horrific sight Thats when I saw her A woman a human woman being brought toward the fire on a spit They intended to cook her as rotisserie They had rubbed her in oil and coated her in seasoning She wailed She screamed then her eyes caught me I knew that was it HELP ME OH LORD HELP ME JESUS CHRIST DONT LET ME DIE My poor woman I am a weak man All of the creatures these rabbitmen turned to me their eyes void of soul My heart stopped That woman was not my problem I turned to run and run I did directly into two large rabbitmen They began to shush me one beat me with a club over the head Blood trickled over my eyes as I fought to get away One of the goblins tackled me to the ground Herbivores No Carnivorous demons they are I scrambled I bit and twisted You see Im very slippery I wrestled myself free fighting to ignore my concussed head It may have been at this point that I soiled myself They all came at me leaving the woman behind She gnawed her ropes until they broke and looked at me There was sorrow in her eyes maybe a hint of conflicting thoughts but truly she felt she had championed The fiend herself I fought to get away I knew not what to do I would not have made for good food I was not porcine or mutton I kicked and bit and thats when the instrument landed next to me Why it was a woodwind a reed made of beasts teeth I grabbed the instrument and began to play It came naturally to me They all stopped Their soulless eyes staring into mine I continued to play my song a song of fear of passion and to my surprise they began to dance My gut was correct always trust your gut my friends I played a merry tune and the creatures were lost in the sound They danced perhaps saw me as one of them they grabbed each other and twirled and hopped They chittered happily a disgusting language I slowly backed away playing louder as I did so they would not notice Thats when I threw the instrument and ran Oh how I ran I just knew they would catch me I left the clearing stepped through the toadstools and ran I did not stop no I experienced an endurance I knew not possible My feet were faster than my body as I leaned back a bit Finally I was out of the tree line I turned to see I had not been followed When I try to sleep I remember I told myself it was a bad dream a hallucination but the knot on my head and the vomiting told me I was concussed Had I fallen Did I forget Is that what caused the dream No it was real and that terrified me more than the experience itself What is out there What else will mankind never know I sat at my easel for I knew I may forget maybe due to some magic which Id never believed before I painted a piece that many found ridiculous I never told them it was true But I did tell them of a great place to think behind the tree line Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments The Man Who Turned Into A Monster 1 mo ago The Man Who Turned Into A Monster There was once a man who turned into a monster It started as a good idea and he convinced himself it was necessary for survival He lived in paradise but didnt see it that way To him the world was merciless and cruel to anyone not properly equipped and prepared He saw himself as weak and vulnerable because he had no protection So to defend himself he looked outward for ways to stay guarded from any potential danger he might encounter He was naked so he needed to be clothed To meet this shortcoming he stripped the palm trees of their leaves so no one would find him exposed He felt powerless so he redirected the waterfall from its original destination to power his machinery for the daily task His ideas worked at first However as the sun kept shining its radiant beauty became vengeance day by day and beat down upon the bare earth It wasnt long until the trees and vegetation dried up without the proper resources After the fish were gone the mammals followed after One day the man could cover himself no longer with the leaves of the trees because they had all withered away He could no longer empower himself without the strength from feeding on his crop and the fowl of the land Looking out into the world he saw it barren from the utopia he knew He finally realized that the only protection he needed was from his mind but the man who turned himself into a monster found out when it was too late Upvote Downvote comments 235 AM 1 mo ago 235 AM Its 235am I lay in bed I lay in bed My eyes are open the hallway light is turned on There is no one home and even

ditch I got it Phil just relax will ya Find a place to pull over we will just wait for a call to come in Phil said finally pulling rank on me Ok ok you spaz I found a pull off area a mile further down the road and parked We were just outside of New Jersey in Warren County Phil would always request to work all the rural areas he did not like working the city much Let the junkies die in their natural habitat He would say then followed by Why waste ours and the hospitals time when they will just be back out there doing it again I was a new EMT and got assigned to Phil as my paramedic I preferred the outskirts also so I just nodded my head and did as I was told I cant afford another career change The rain started to pelt the vehicle even harder drowning out the sound of the old ambulance engine Phil had his cap down and was trying to sleep I turned on the radio to the Mets game Tune that crap off Phil grumbled Its the World Series you ass I shot back Its the Mets no one cares about the Mets this is a Yankees vehicle only But they are playing the Sox I pleaded Phil lifted his cap looked at me stern and said Turn it off I rolled my eyes and switched the station A muffled Walk this way by Aerosmith and Run DMC started to blare out of the blown ambulance speakers Phil just shot me a dirty look I switched to the next station Papa Dont Preach by Madonna What are you a 15yearold girl he said while leaning in to change the station Phil clicked it over to a news station talking about John Gotti and many of his associates that were on trial for racketeering and murder charges The radio Jocky was spouting out names like he was reading from the Godfathers wedding invitation list Gambino Corle Campione Valentino and Maranzano The list just went on Ha those Dago Wops finally got what was coming to them feel like they could run my city Phil said smirking Hey at least they dispose of the bodies so we dont have to deal with them right Phil Phil shot me another dirty look Shut up Mikey Just then we got a call on the radio a 4 car pile up about 15 minutes away My eyes lit up Can we get this one Phil We wont make it kid let someone else get it He said pulling his hat back over his eyes Its 4 cars we can at least head that way to help Be my guest kid just get us there in one piece I hit the lights and sped off I needed some excitement Riding along with Phil all night tends to make for a dull shift The rain seemed to match my excitement and started to come down even more fierce than before I could feel the gust of wind challenging the speed of the ambulance swinging the back of the vehicle back and forth Slow down kid I looked over to tell Phil to relax when out of the corner of my eye a blue dress with white flowers in the middle of the road caught my eye I slammed on the brakes and jolted the steering wheel left trying to evade the blue sun dress The whole ambulance started to hydroplane followed by a loud thud sound on the side of the square ambulances shell I started to feel some resistance of the vehicle sliding while at the same time the tires tap dancing from being slightly lifted off the ground Finally we came to a complete stop I looked over and Phil was already out of the Rig Oh boy did you fuck up kid Phil belted out with amusement I met him on the other side of the ambulance to see him staring at a mangled body twisted a contorted The left arm was flush behind the upper body where the hand could be seen almost grasping the right shoulder The left shoulder bone was caved in where you would see what they call the broad of the shoulder Friction from the tire marks burned holes in to separate parts of the once skyblue dress The body was barely twitching I was stunned my brain was mush and my heart felt like it was in my stomach Grab the gurney and get me an extra sheet Phil barked I rushed to the back of the disheveled ambulance feeling relieved that Phil was taking the lead I grabbed the gurney and sheets and headed over to see Phil administering something into the womens vein in her arm then quickly putting the syringe back into a small black leather doctors bag What is that Phil I asked come on lets get her on the gurney he snapped Phil rolled her lifeless body in the sheet as if he was rolling her into an area rug like you see in the movies I went to strap her in until Phil batted my hand away annoyingly Just get her in the back and start driving once loaded up Phil told me to stop if I seen any cars on the side of the road About a mile down the road was a Colbert blue Volkswagen bug leaning forward in a ditch with the front end wrapped around a tree I pulled over Phil shouldnt we be calling this in or getting her to the hospital Wont do any good she has expired But she was twitching when we got to her I said with fading hope in my voice Yeah well I administered enough fentanyl to kill the most experienced junkie lets hope you hitting her did the trick so she does not wake up overdosing My eyes got big and I was immediately nauseous and confused at the same time You injected her with fentanyl But Why Do you want to explain what really happened here tonight Phil said half smirking You will be back flipping burgers or pressing license plates in the penitentiary if anyone finds out what you did Phil looked up at me with a stern but also opportunist look in his face You owe me one after tonight kid Phil unveiled the lifeless body from the sheets and laid the shattered body into the front seat of the car How is this going to pass off when her body has all those injuries I said hoping Phil would change his mind Phil looked at me and gave me another one of those smirks again only this one was more sinister before I knew it he grabbed the poor girl by the back of her head and smashed her face through the already cracked now shattered windshield The clear shattered glass started to bleed red before he pulled her back and slammed her face for a second time this time her face sticking to the windshield Her face was held on by every shard of glass penetrating her forehead and cheeks As I watched the blood splatter all over the windshield I could not help but to start vomiting I could hear Phil laughing behind me You ok kid You need me to drive Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments Wear the raincoat 1 mo ago Wear the raincoat This is a true

everyone across San Francisco rain feathery light and mulishly stubborn rain Skipping the excuses I disregarded the weather instead of dressing for it My consequence was a soggy half hour bike ride punctuated by red lights and oil slick puddles that left me moody and dripping at the doors of the commuter rail station I had arrived at the starting line of an hourlong train ride soaking wet There is one rapid transit line that connects San Francisco to the mountain of tech jobs waiting south in Silicon Valley Trains leave every 20 minutes during rush hour destined for the same list of weigh points congested with opportunity salaries and promises of building a better future These commuters exercise their laptops like Roy Rogers rode Trigger into rugged American optimism framed with commercial appeal I wouldnt drip and shiver next to one of these respectable architects of the future without first making a punitive attempt to wring myself out But before I wrung I had to dump Ponds had collected in each of my cowboy boots Working a sodden leather boot off a waterlogged sock while standing on one foot in the same condition is about as good as being lame I must have made a pitiful sight under the awning of the 4th and King CalTrain station I harbor confidence in this assessment because above the civil noises of several hundred commuters rattling through a cement and glass hive cut an observation Im having a better day than you It was a mans voice clear and convincing My own stubborn pride smacked a smile on my face and lifted my head up to search the crowd for the source My uncomfortable grin was pleading that the commentary steered more toward laughing with than laughing at I found the author of the comment He guided a cart neatly stacked with empty bottles and crushed cans still worth their refund fee He didnt break stride moving easily through the congestion in the station I would exist as an afterthought of an artifact in his rearview mirror for only another second if that The crowd reshuffled and we were detached The rest of the day wrote nothing to memory It could have been lovely or lucky or more likely sour and soggy Fire hose to my head I couldnt tell you when the rain stopped It might have been that minute or lunchtime or it might have continued until yesterday for all I recall All the good and bad of that day got smeared drowned or eaten by another anxiety older or newer The day was forgotten except for the man and his comment So desperate to keep turning over such few facts I still wonder why his comment stuck Lucid scrutiny dismisses him as the cause of his own memorability sadly I know nothing about him So his permanence in my mind must root in assumptions He tells himself the truth and listens Consider the weather that day he kept himself dry That was more than I did showing up distracted by my own slippery condition Consider his collection of recycling he recognized value in a resource many overlook and dismiss as a nuisance That is an impressive amount of determination and paying attention Consider his comment he must know the damage of a bad day And still he has an enthusiasm for life In some interpretations he had drawn the short straw of life and decided he still wanted to play the whole game He must have hope I wonder what for If I knew his hope would I have turned back for a raincoat I hope he did have a

episode E drove me crazy until I turned 19 It wasnt just because she had piercing eyes which she did or a thick dark skin that seemed impenetrable or a contagious laugh that always drew attention to her She had all those physical qualities and more she attracted anyone like a drone bee to its queen But as my feelings for her intensified they started to cloud my mind with pain and suffering She was quite a catch and I felt compelled to explore the depths of my emotions Looking back now in my early thirties I wish I had known better Perhaps I wouldnt have lingered so long with the insecurities that developed along the way I have to admit to myself I was naive paid the price for it and still wish it wasnt part of my journey or for those that will follow in my footsteps Anyway things seemed promising when I first laid eyes on E I had just repeated a class and the thought of failing was agonizing I didnt have high hopes for anything positive to come from my studies Then she entered the classroom or the stream we had been assigned to I had already settled in silently enduring the shame hoping other students would focus on finding their seats and not on me the unfamiliar face among them Even though E wore a headscarf and her legs were concealed in the long skirts of our school uniform my 16yearold mind saw past the uniforms ugliness The rules of our Muslim school were straightforward but in that moment my hormones overrode my sense of decorum The prevailing notion was that nobody should discover my feelings as long as I kept my mouth shut and my desires concealed

fifteen minutes ago with the pilot stating that it would only last a second or two It grew more violent until there were people trying to pick themselves off of the floor because of the sudden downward shift that happened a moment before that launched them from their seats Well be fine it cant last forever Austin said over the wall of noise that now filled the cabin A sudden tilt to the left had the passengers screaming and crying as the plane banked hard and didnt straighten out The wind around the fuselage roared and metal screamed from outside the plane The pilot was saying something over the intercom but no one could make it out Her heart raced and her body became stiff Austin threw himself around her shielding her from carry on bags that were falling from the overhead compartments A suitcase came out and hit the man in front on them and she seen him go limp his arms floating up She squeezed her eyes shut A crack of thunder ripped though the plane and she felt her stomach contract The jet engines whined higher and higher as if they were crying out of fear Mel Mel she heard someone screaming her name She opened her eyes and seen that Austin was shouting at her

had run down her face She seen a gray beach and now heard the waves pushing in from the sea She blinked and felt the grit of sand next to her eyes Storm clouds rolled overhead and the wind slammed into trees that loomed just beyond her The branches jerked back and forth while their leaves were swept from them and carried away Hot white pain seared through her lower stomach The baby She tried to

pain and fatigue was now tugging at her Exhaustion was setting in and it was growing dark outside The pain returned and she gritted her teeth in a yelp She groaned as her stomach tightened in a hard ball of flesh and muscle Her breathing became quick and shallow and she fell onto her back An aching pain that started in her lower back began to march up her spine Her auburn hair clung to her face and she tasted seawater She spat out the hair and bit down at the returning contraction A twig snapped in the trees but she couldnt move not with this much pain She kept panting breaths her hands balled into fists in the sand Then it came A pain so great she felt her mind slipping Her stomach knotted one last time and the urge to push came stronger than she had ever felt Tears streamed down her face and she gave everything she had and pushed Melting pain Flesh being pulled apart and ripped Her eyes widened and she couldnt make a sound She couldnt breathe Something large and wet passed between her legs and then a great relief followed Her muscles went limp Her breathing went long and slow Her pain was still very much present but she was so numb now that it hardly mattered Then she heard the cry The cry that her and Austin had looked so forward to for 9 months The cry that sparked some internal instinct inside her that never existed A jolt of energy and determination filled her veins and she pulled herself into a sitting position Her gut muscles protested at the movement but she wasnt stopping She made it up on her elbows when she seen the little boy laying in the sand between her legs mouth open and crying out The little legs kicked in agony and the hands pulled at the air The purple face was contorted in pain and terror The cord attached at the belly of the newborn was pulsing The babys scream came again and she felt a piece of her chest crack So she screamed HELP HELP SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME The cry was pitiful and in vein Her throat burned and the phlegm that had dried to it came loose She choked and spit it out beside her About ten feet from her stood an ape The dark outline of the muscular creature sat impossibly still The fur was drenched in water but the eyes were glued to Melodys She didnt have time for fear or the energy She looked at the ape and noticed something in its eyes that made her stop The apes eyes were utterly black and leathery yet they were soft It was a primal look but a compassionate one as if watching something horrible happen The babys cry sounded again and Melody whipped her head to it She looked around her and found a rock She reached for it and brought it down hard on the cord connecting the two A squirt of blood shot out Another hit Another The cord was ripped apart by the rock and leftover blood poured out in the sand She reached forward once more her whole body overwhelmed with exhaustion and picked up the newborn Its sand covered skin felt milky in her hands as she brought it to her chest She opened her shirt and rested the baby on her breast She lied back defeated and tired Spasms worked their way through her stomach and thighs The aching pain between her legs throbbed with each beat of her heart The realization of everything slowly began to set in The plane Austin The baby and her body The baby cooed on her chest and balled up She looked down at the matted black hair and began to weep For Austin For the baby For herself She sat there for what seemed like a full day The clouds gathered above her thick black and rolling with the high winds of the sky The wind had picked back up and the sun began its descent somewhere behind a great cliff behind her When she could feel the last of her life trickling away she looked over to where the ape had sat It was still there It mightve even moved a little closer she wasnt sure She didnt care She reached out a trembling had to it Its eyes watched her carefully Her hand fell to the sand and she said weakly Please At her voice the ape took a step forward then stopped Its eyes going from her to the baby After a moment it shuffled slowly over to her The beast stopped beside her and scratched itself on the chest It snorted and began to sniff the air Its black mangled hair shifted under its movement She reached out and touched the leather hand of the beast It didnt move She met those soft eyes once more and tapped on its hand Take him Take him Dont let him die was all she could muster before the boundaries of her vision shrank and blurred into complete blackness Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments My friend named Anna Ad

Rebellions rise up against tyrants Entire communities starve But for the people of the once lush world Gaia these harsh realities were things of fiction With tribal communities surrounding their cultures around the balance of nature they had found harmony This is the accurate account of how us humans destroyed that delicate balance recorded from the eyes of the natives Let this be a lesson to future generations and may God forgive us for what we have done I pray history will not repeat itself because the next time it happens it may not be an alien world but our own Translated from Cettet written by one of the natives of Gaia Faern It Came From The Stars We saw it streak across the night sky The ball of flames was so large it blocked out our two moons Mur and I were gathering fruit when it happened I suppose I should explain what Mur and I are exactly in case you are not one of the Shalitnat Mothers Children I am Faern a Dastread We are animallike people Our faces are long and elegant with long ears that hang Our bodies are covered in short fur in varying shades of brown tan and gray Many of us have horns or antlers We are tall I suppose compared to the hairless ones that came from the sky and we have long tails unlike them as well Our hands have four digits instead of their five with short claws though rarely do we use themMy fur was is a light brown in shade with a lighter underside and a tan face My head is decorated with small antlers I say decorated because they serve no real use apart from just that Decoration A pretty thing Our devotion to The Mother makes it so we never need to use them Violence is abhorred unless to defend against predators Violence against another Shalitnat or any other being is left to The Mothers judgment But I digress Mur was my dearest friend She was a Khukhed a small nimble creature Khukhed are similar to us I suppose but different as well They are little four legged creatures with large eyes and shorter faces They too have hanging ears and heads decorated with antlers or horns but while our tails are strong prehensile tools theirs are long and thin ending with a tuft of fur They move about with a sort of hoprun motion with their back legs longer than their front I always found it adorable Murs fur was white with black patches her left ear nearly completely enveloped by a spot Her horns curved cutely around her ears and her large eyes were the brightest blue Id ever seen They were always my favorite That color will always remind me of her Upvote Downvote comments Story created on Chat GPT using the prompts of

League stuck on other side of galaxy on a planet where the inhabitants are only sixinches high Write in the style of Shakespeare In fair cosmos where we lay our scene Where Justice League doth venture bold and keen Upon a distant planets tiny shore Their noble quest hath led them evermore Lo Tis a realm where humans small abide No taller than a hand in size they hide Yet in their hearts courage doth brightly shine Though stature small their spirits are divine Twas Batman noble knight did lead the band With Superman the hero of the land Wonder Woman with strength and grace refined And Flash whose speed left foes far behind Upon this planet strange they found themselves A land of wonders as if from faerie shelves But danger lurked in every blade of grass And challenges did swiftly come to pass Perchance a village they did chance upon With houses small like toys neath golden sun The villagers did marvel at their sight For heroes grand had come into their light Yet troubles brewed for in this tiny land An evil tyrant held an iron hand His name was Zargoth cruel and unjust His rule enforced with fear and mistrust The Justice League with valiant hearts aglow Did vow to rid this land of tyrants woe They rallied villagers both young and old To rise against oppression brave and bold But Zargoth with his minions dark and vile Did seek to crush rebellion with a smile His armies marched with spears and shields arrayed To quell the hopes of those who dared to aid In battle fierce the Justice League did stand With courage fierce they fought hand in hand Superman did soar above the fray While Batman led the ground troops in the fray Wonder Woman with lasso bright and true Did bind the enemy their plans undo And Flash with speed unmatched by mortal man Did swiftly thwart each evil cunning plan But victory came not without its toll For heroes brave did suffer heart and soul Yet still they fought with honor undeterred For justices sake their fervor never blurred At last the tide did turn the tyrant fell Defeated by the heroes fierce and well The villagers rejoiced their freedom won Their battle against tyranny was done And so the Justice League with hearts elate Did bid farewell to this small wondrous state Their mission complete they soared cross the sky In search of new adventures far and nigh For though their journey took them far and wide Their deeds of valor

Remember It had been three years since I had felt any emotions remotely close to this A feeling so deep that its almost impossible to describea feeling that scared me but also excited me the feeling of being wanted It was a dreary Friday afternoon in mid2016 I watched as the clock ticked closer and closer to 200 I was eager to head back from my internship and get to the one thing that managed to bring my emotions back to life I sat anxiously looking at my phone every couple of minutes waiting for the clock to strike 200 Finally 200 came I frantically grabbed my keys and wallet and headed out the door As I walked to my car the dark heavy clouds littered the sky and the smell of rain came over me I felt the cool rain on my face while it peppered my heather grey shirt I picked up my pace and continued to walk to my car I grabbed the soaked handle of my mid2000s coupe opened the door and sat down behind the wheel I put the key in the ignition shifted into gear and pulled out As I drove silently through town memories of past texts started popping into my mind I started to mentally dissect past messages trying to figure out what our relationship was Dismissing the messages and chalking it up to me reading into it I began to reflect on our time together as friends Its hard to describe the feeling Anytime we were together things felt simple we could talk about almost everything and joke about almost everything but the one thing I loved most was how she made me feel physically It was unlike anything I had felt before It was a deep feeling like a boulder was sitting on my chest I felt nervous but at peace Again its hard to describe but a feeling that I have yet to replicate I made it215 I pulled into the parking lot my brakes screeching as I backed into my assigned spot I put the car in park and yanked up the ebrake As I sat watching the droplets of rain race down my windshield a loud dingding echoed from my phone Hoping it wasnt an I dont need a ride or Im taking the bus text I opened my phone The message reads Are you here Not wanting to answer immediately like a desperate loser I waited a couple of minutes before responding Yes let me know when youre on your way out Not a second went by before she responded with a simple Ok The minutes passed as I stared forward waiting for my fellow classmates to erupt from the exit doors Finally I saw the students start pouring out I watched and waited until eventually I saw her emerge from the crowd Laughing while walking with her friend she looked at me in my car and waved with a huge grin on her face I looked back at her smiling as I returned a small wave As she approached my car I felt my heart beating faster and faster She opened the door and climbed into my passenger seat She looked up at me smiling as she said Hey How was your day I started up my car and cautiously backed out of my parking spot We exchanged some casual conversation as I navigated my way through the busy rainy lot As we pulled onto the main road I noticed that something was different Her demeanor seemed more reserved than usual We looked back at one another as we continued our conversation We talked about how after I dropped her off I had to go back to the school to load up for the state championship for our swim team She had just joined the team that year and surprisingly was supposed to be there too However she wasnt able to make it I always liked driving her home through the back roads because it gave us more time to talk laugh and just be together Eventually we made it to her house I slowly pulled up to the curb put the car in park and then looked at her She stared back at me This time there wasnt the silly banter before saying something like Thanks Ill see you on Monday Insert stupid joke This time it was serious That was when I knew This was the moment I had waited for I would finally be able to tell her how I felt But the fear and anxiety of losing her rushed into my mind Silence I couldnt say it We sat for another moment staring into each others eyes listening as the thunder rumbled in the distance and the rain continued to cascade down the windshield Finally we broke our gaze The rain began to lift she reached for the car door the tension in the car was almost unbearable She looked at me opened the door and said OK well have a good time Youre going to do great I wish I could be there with you I wish you could be there too I replied She crawled out of the passenger seat shut the door and then looked back at me with the same gaze as before I returned the look started my car and watched as she disappeared behind her front door She knew Fuck I muttered as I pulled away from her house What now I thought Based on the tension we both felt in the car I knew she felt the same way that I felt about her I continued to drive down the winding road gripping my steering wheel tighter and tighter I kept glancing back at my phone waiting for a text something that would ease my nerves even a simple Thanks for the ride would have sufficed Nothing I slowly pulled into the empty parking lot to load up for state I threw the car into park turned the key off and opened the door to start my trek to the van Right as I grabbed my bag from the back seat and shut my door the rain started pouring out of the dark heavy clouds Trying not to fall I sprinted to the van I swung the trunk open threw my bag in then climbed through the side door and found my way to the back seat I sat waiting for the rest of the team peering out the window watching as the rain continued to drench the ground I couldnt stop thinking about her I couldnt get that moment out of my head Why didnt I say something I thought Why didnt she say anything My mind continued to race with these hypotheticals Finally I saw some of my fellow teammates emerge from the rain My good friend and teammate entered the car we exchanged a Whats up damp from the rain he plumped down into the seat beside me Eventually the rest of the team slowly trickled into the van Once everyone was in we were off Im normally a very talkative guy always trying to make others laugh but I sat silently as the van navigated its way onto the highway My friend well call him T looked at me and could tell something was up He tapped on my shoulder I turned to look at him he said Dude whats going on with you Nothing I replied He responded with I know you man youre never this quiet T knew that I had been texting and giving this girl rides home for about a month now In fact T knew her before I did and was actually the one who introduced us when she joined the team I reluctantly started to brief him on what happened Surprised T laughed and said Are you kidding me You didnt say anything I could tell you were into her Why didnt you tell her how you felt Was it really that obvious I thought I looked back at him and said Yeah uhh I mean I didnt think she felt that way about me but that moment in the car was just different man I could tell she felt it too T responded with Why dont you just text her Its not that easy I dont want to seem desperate I said T scoffed Really he said If what youre saying is true then I doubt shell take it as desperate Ok I said I reached into the pocket of my track pants to retrieve my phone I turned my phone over hoping to see a text Snapchat or something from her I clicked the lock button and the bright display lit up Nothing no new messages Damn it I said under my breath T looked at me and said What Did she say something No I was hoping she would have That would have made things way easier I said with a nervous chuckle Just send something Jesus youre being weird about it said T Ok ok Ill send her something I swiped my finger across my smudged screen to the third page selected my social media folder and opened Snapchat I opened my chat feed to see if I missed anything from her Again nothing I swiped back to the camera lifted my phone and took a picture pointing to the front of the dimly lit van I didnt want to immediately address the moment we had in the car so I sent the picture with some stupid caption joking at the expense of one of my fellow teammates Sent Ok shell see it and respond and then things wont be weird I thought The last thing I wanted was to mess up our friendship by telling her how I felt about her romantically I sighed locked my phone and shoved it back into my pocket Whatd you say said T Oh uhh I just sent her a picture of the car with a caption about how weird our teammate is Really You didnt say anything else You didnt mention the whole thing that happened in the car Annoyed with how much of a coward I was being I responded with a disappointed no As we continued the drive the car grew darker and darker and the rain continued to beat down It had been about 45 minutes since I last sent the Snapchat I didnt receive any notifications so thinking that I must have missed something I unlocked my phone and opened Snapchat only to see that she opened the picture and didnt respond My heart dropped It felt like I had been kicked in the stomach Fuck Fuck Fuck I thought She always responds why didnt she say anything Did I make things weird in the car Everyone knows friends becoming lovers isnt always a good idea and 99 of the time the feelings arent reciprocated and the friendship comes to an abrupt awkward stop I peered back down at my phone closed Snapchat and with a deep sigh of defeat clicked the lock button As I wrestled to get my phone back in my pocket T looked at me and said Anything Nope Nothing I responded I turned away from T and laid my head against the cool window my heavy eyes began to close as I drifted off to sleep DING DING DING DING rang the ajar door I opened my eyes squinting as the warm white lights shined down on my face Were here yelled the coach I lifted my head from the now foggy smudged window Where are we I mumbled to T Were stopping to eat before we head over to take a look at the pool Perfect I groggily replied Rubbing the sleep from my eyes I stretched and yawned feeling the stiffness from the awkward position I had dozed off in I fished my phone from my pocket to see if she had sent anything Again nothing What the hell I thought I feel like things werent that weirdam I overanalyzing this I locked my phone shoving it back into my pocket T stood up from his seat and began to make his way to the side door of the stuffy van I gathered my things and followed stepping out into the damp chilly air The rain had let up leaving behind the lingering scent of wet pavement I looked at T and said She still hasnt said anything Normally she responds within minutes Its been like two hours I exclaimed Dont worry about it said T Maybe shes just sleeping I think its fine Ok yeah this is dumb Im just going to try to forget about it I replied As the last of the team exited the van the side door slammed shut I looked up at the huge buildings towering over the tiny collegethemed restaurant as I walked alongside T entering the restaurant This way please said the hostess as she navigated our team through the loud crowded restaurant She pulled open two huge barn doors revealing a small private room for the team to dine in I meandered through the cramped room squeezing through chairs as I found my seat at the table I picked up the menu from the enormous oak table as I took my seat The room was packed erupting with conversations and laughter Though I was normally not one for being reserved I sat quietly in my seat with thoughts of her still weighing on my mind We ordered got our food and began to eat After stuffing myself with greasy bar food I was ready to get to the pool to take a look around As we sat waiting for the check I felt a buzz come from my pocket I dug my greasecovered hand into my pocket to check my phone It was her A notification from Snapchat She sent a chat I sat silently as I stared blankly at my phone Shit I thought Shes going to mention what happened Not wanting to fuck up my night I dropped my phone back in my pocket We finally left the restaurant to find the van parked on the curb We walked down the wet sidewalk riddled with cracks and puddles I opened the side door to the van and climbed into the back seat I sat down and watched as T plumped down to my left Once the van was all loaded up the coach yelled Alright were off to the pool then were going back to the hotel The door slammed shut the van started up and we were off Not much happened on the road over to the pool as it was only a couple minutes away All I can remember was sitting nervously as the unread chat overtook my mind We get to the pool hop out of the van and approach the entrance As we walked into the building which smelt of chlorine and was riddled with cool white fluorescent lights I turned to T and muttered She responded Alarmed T turned to me and said What When About half an hour ago I said What did it say said T I dont know I havent opened it yet I replied Really Just fucking open it Fine I responded I pulled my phone from my pocket as we walked through the building entering the pool area I reluctantly slid my clammy finger across the unlock button and proceeded to type in my passcode My heart was racing I opened Snapchat and clicked on the message Hey I have something to tell you I sat staring blankly at the screen Shit Shes going to mention it I thought I sat for a second opened the keyboard and replied Sure whats up She promptly opened the text and responded with I know youre busy now but I couldnt stop thinking about earlier I paused my stomach dropping I looked at T my face red he said Are you good Yep I said with a small shake in my voice I glanced back down at my phone to see that she was typing again My heart was pounding out of my chest concerned for what the next message would say I couldnt keep my eyes off the screen I was yearning for the response About a minute passed before she finally crafted a long message that read something along the lines of I know things felt a little weird in the car I have liked you for a while now and in the car it took everything in me to not kiss you I felt like you were feeling the same way but I didnt know I cant stop thinking about the car I dont want to mess up our friendship but I thought I should tell you how I feel Overjoyed and with a smile spread across my face I promptly responded with I wanted to kiss you too Ive been thinking about the car all day Im so glad you felt what I felt I wish I would have done something I really like you and I wish I could have said that in person I was really nervous haha Thats ok she responded I cant wait for you to get back I want to see you right as you get home We continued to exchange thoughts of how we felt about each other It was amazing That was the feeling I felt so happy so relieved and now I felt wantedlike really wanted Euphoria I immediately briefed T on what was said Thats awesome I could tell from when you guys first started hanging out that something would happen I scoffed Well I didnt I never thought Id be able to get a girl as hot as her I said with my high school brain The evening proceeded as I continued to chat with her The messages got better and better each one making me feel stronger about how I felt about her I was ready to get back home The championship meet came to a close and it was finally time to head home We crammed back in the van to make one last stop at the hotel before heading out I promptly walked through the dimly lit midlevel hotel to the elevator and clicked the up button lighting up as I pressed it I walked down the hall held my white key card to the door pulled the handle and entered Since I planned to see her right away I quickly undressed and jumped in the shower The warm water rained down on me as I ran my hands through my hair lathering on shampoo I grabbed the washcloth still damp from the night prior I swiftly washed my body I rinsed off grabbed my towel from the rack and dried off I started getting dressed I knew that we only had about five minutes left so I quickly put on my clothes scooped up my hair product with my finger and ran it through my hair I brushed my teeth and sprayed myself with my cheap cologne I walked out of the bathroom with my hair still damp I rushed to stuff my drawstring backpack with my waddedup clothes and damp swimsuit I briefly checked around the room to ensure I hadnt left anything behind I swung my backpack over my shoulders as I grabbed the cool metal door handle I rushed to the elevator and rode to the bottom floor After exiting the elevator I lightly jogged across the glossy tile floor of the hotel lobby Pushing the revolving door I eagerly walked up to the van and jumped in About time said the swim coach As I was the last one down I shimmed my way to the back of the van and sat down on the light grey cloth seats The coach turned the key pulled out and started our venture back home I reached into my pocket and looked at my phone reading over the messages sent from the night before still dumbfounded by the fact that she felt the same way I felt about her We continued to exchange messages about how excited we were to see each other To make the trip feel shorter I laid my head against the window closed my eyes as I thought about her and dozed off Click click click click the seatbelts clattered I slowly opened my eyes and felt the van jolt forward as the coach shifted it into park This is it I thought I cant wait to see her kiss her feel her I pressed the large red seatbelt button and sprung from my seat I bolted forward pushing and shoving my fellow teammates as I exited the van I gave them all a brief goodbye and started walking to my car I opened Snapchat and sent her a message Where are you I said Im working Im about to go on break Do you want to pick me up I just want to see you she responded Yes I said I can be there in five minutes She responded with a simple I cant wait I drew closer and closer to my car trembling with excitement I swung my door open and climbed in I started the car and began driving Speeding through the suburban roads excited to see her My heart pounded faster and faster as I grew closer and closer to pick her up Finally I arrived at her work I sent her a quick message saying Im pulling up Coming she replied I pulled up to the curb and watched as she exited Though she was dressed head to toe in her work attire she still looked beautiful as always I unlocked my doors as she approached my car She grabbed the handle and pulled the door open She leaned her head in smiling and said Hey Im so happy to see you I returned the smile and said You too Ive been thinking about you all day She jumped into the passenger seat and directed me to park in the corner of the lot I pulled the car into drive and cautiously navigated my way through the parking lot I pulled into a parking spot and shifted the car into park I looked at her she looked back at me with her freckled face and dark brown eyes The aura from the days prior began creeping back into the car She drew me in with her gaze as she reached down and laid her hand on my leg I raised my arm and pushed her jetblack hair from her face I rubbed my thumb against her cheek and said Youre so beautiful Ive been waiting so long for this Me too She whispered We sat for a moment still locked in on each other She began to rub her hand on my leg as I combed my fingers through her hair We grew closer and closer now less than an inch from each other we both gently closed our eyes and drew closer as I felt her soft lips meet mine Fireworks It was an explosion of emotions a rush of warmth and electricity ignited between us It felt amazing The kiss continued for a few minutes before drawing back to look at her Her beautiful eyes looked back into mine as we both smiled We chatted for a bit about how much we meant to each other She pulled me back in for another kiss this time longer She continued to rub my leg as I ran my hand down her back feeling the side of her breast brush against my arm The kiss grew deeper and more passionate as each moment passed Buzz buzz buzz rang her alarm from her pocket forcing us to pull back from one another It was time for her to get back to work We looked at each other once more Still baffled by how beautiful she was I found it hard to break away from her stare Finally I turned my attention back to the matter at hand I stepped on the brake put the car in reverse and began to back out of the spot I continued as I slowly pulled up to the curb Im so glad youre back I cant wait to see you again she said Me too I cant wait I exclaimed We leaned in for one final kiss before she closed my car door and retreated to work walking through the sliding glass doors as she glanced back at me with a huge smile spread across her face Finally I felt wanted loved and complete There are monumental moments in a persons life that stick with them forever This was one of those moments Even though this happened almost a decade ago I still remember it like it was yesterday Unfortunately I lost the original Snapchat messages exchanged between the two of us Sometimes I wish I could read them again just to replicate the indescribable feeling they made me feel that day As for the rest of the story we dated for about four months but like most good things they must come to an end It ended how most high school relationships end I went off to college and she stayed back home We tried to date longdistance but between not being able to see each other and other drama we werent able to make things work In the end I think it was for the best People have to move on but memories like this this vivid this impactful dont come often I do think about her I wonder what she thinks of me now I wonder if she cherishes that day as much as I do Dedicated to her I loved you so much You cross my

opinions on this short story I made 1 mo ago Any opinions on this short story I made The sun had long dipped below the horizon leaving the city shrouded in darkness Detective Angus Adler stood at the edge of the crime scene the flashing lights of police cars painting the street in a bright glow He took a deep breath the familiar smell of blood and asphalt filling his nostrils The victim was lying down on the pavement a young man in his twenties his eyes wide open in a frozen stare His chest was covered in blood a single stab wound visible just below his ribs Angus knelt beside him his gloved hand hovering over the body hesitant to disturb the scene Any witnesses he asked not expecting an answer The officer shook his head Not yet sir But were examining the area Angus nodded his mind already racing through the possibilities Maybe another gangrelated killing or a vendetta that backfired He knew he wouldnt have answers until he had more information As he stood up a chill ran down his spine He felt as if someone was watching him a sensation he had learned to trust over the years He scanned the dark alleyways and empty streets but saw nothing out of the ordinary With a sigh he turned back to the body This was just the beginning of a long night Angus spent hours at the crime scene trying to find anything that could give him a lead He found nothing The killer had left no fingerprints or traces behind Nobody knew the man and nobody was looking for him The only information the police could find was a name James Davis He was the mysterious man who was killed on April 6th 2021 It was night everything was blurry his head was hurting and he couldnt think straight He was in the dark alleyway where James Davis had been found dead It was cold he could feel the fresh breeze brushing his hair when he raised his head to look at the moon He looked down and found himself staring at a bloody knife in his hand a wave of shock and horror washed over him He tried to remember how he had ended up here but his memory was foggy fragmented He could recall bits and pieces a struggle a voice pleading for mercy but it all seemed distant unreal He dropped the knife the clang of metal against the pavement echoing loudly in the silent alley He stumbled backward his heart pounding in his chest There lying on the ground before him was James Daviss lifeless body just as he had found it that night As he looked down he saw his own reflection in a puddle of blood A deep voice echoed in his head You cant escape the truth it will come back for you Angus woke up drenched in sweat his heart pounding in his chest It took him a moment and he realized that he was in his own bed safe He sat up running a hand through his hair as he tried to shake off the lingering sense of dread It felt so real standing in that alleyway Angus shuddered unable to shake a feeling of unease lingering from his dream He looked at the clock on his wall indicating 130 am Detective Angus stepped into the dimly lit bathroom He flicked on the light switch and the harsh brightness flooded the small space For a moment everything seemed normal But then he looked down at his hands They were covered in blood A scream tore from his throat echoing off the tiled walls Angus stumbled backward his mind reeling How could this have happened He felt as if he needed to go back to where this all began He grabbed his coat and headed towards the dark streets of Chicago As he was walking towards the alley where James Davis took his last breath he felt as if someone was watching him The same feeling he had on that previous night As Angus arrived he smelled something off the smell of fresh blood everywhere He rushed towards the crime scene worried about what he would find Something worse than anything he could have imagined In bright bloody writing the walls of the alley were painted with the same words everywhere YOU will pay for YOUR sins Upvote Downvote comments A little story about love being found in odd places And how long distance can make you see things differently Plan 1 mo ago A little story about love being found in odd places And how long distance can make you see things differently Its a little funny I think when I pause to consider just how deeply sentiment has found a way to seep beneath my skin As if it were an ever staining ink that bleeds right into my veins and becomes a part of my dna Today its all about a bottle of Advil How silly is that Who else would clutch a bottle of simple pills in their hand and feel their heart flutter at the thought of those hands those hands I love above all others opened this bottle Those hands have a history imprinted into this plastic and paper label Muscle memory was formed upon the white smooth surface along the carved in divots allowing for just enough tension to be formed to easily open the bottle The pills within this granted you relief they brought an end or dullness at least to something I wish I could whisk away So I am thankful to it just as I wrap my own hands around the polymers exterior and imagine the history formed upon it To me it is like brushing finger tips with past you with the person I have loved for so long It is a simple bottle yes but in the remove of our circumstances it becomes an item so sacred one would imagine it brought from a bejeweled tomb or some other archeological marvel This simple bottle will likely never see this kind of admiration again I wonder on that as I place it down getting down low so I can eye it off face to face Perhaps my love for this object is not folly at all instead it is a fools errand to live with ignorance towards such things as so many others do For finding meaning in such an item brings no harm to anyone The bottle continues to function as it should and my heart feels afloat each time I reach for it A world built with ever more love cannot be a worse off place Upvote Downvote comments Blinded 2 mo ago Blinded This is my short story about

instant said It is done Geouf of somewhere the elements have bestowed your wish you now have the power of dick force lightning LILY Such a human request Crude and disgusting Still elemental magic had

pants now burned on the groin area and the old lady disappeared in a distracting puff of smoke with a Kabum of lightning My mind raced for a split second and focused on the area where the old woman was a second ago Trying to make sense of what just happened the only thing through my brain was I just murdered that lady a thought that lasted about 3 seconds before the woman appeared unscathed behind the smoke screen YOU FILTHY IGNORANT HUMAN YOU DARE TRY TO STRIKE ME DOWN AND WITH MY OWN MAGIC she was alive and faes existed Uh How I asked ignoring her lashing out its Impossible I mustve

survived Only then as they counted the survivors did they see Clara clutching her side They watched as the blood dripped down her legs paralyzed by fear and unable to help She looked up and smiled at them as if it was a last goodbye As she opened her mouth her eyes began to shut Her lifeless body fell to the ground surrounded by a pool of her own blood The group members stared at her for what felt like an eternity before realizing what had happened She was the only one smart enough to escape the one who sacrificed everything though she had the most to lose She was now lifeless bloody and surrounded by people she only knew for a few hours though it felt like their whole lives But they knew the unfortunate truth The fact that they would have to leave her behind Knowing that she sacrificed everything while the remaining survivors wouldnt sacrifice anything for her They walked away looking back every so often as her body became colder They covered their ears as they could hear the screams from those left behind in the house Forever burdened by the guilt of those who were left behind and unable to be helped We have to go back cried Ezekiel For what So we can end up like Clara argued Rachel As the words left her mouth only then did she realize what she said The group looked at her as their faces became disgusted Wait I didnt mean it like that Rachel tried to reason If we go back we are for sure dead Their screams are nothing but a sirens call We have to save ourselves We made it this far The survivors faces turned to disappointment I would rather die knowing I tried to help than live with the guilt of what we did Jackson said harshly You cant be serious Its a death wish Its not our fault theyre incompetent They had all the time in the world We tried to help them They didnt want it Were not saying you have to go with us but were going back so either you come with us or you dont We honestly dont care As the rest of the survivors headed back to the house Rachel began to swell with anger All her life she felt like she was drowning yet no one wanted to save her She would cry for help though the lifeguard couldnt swim Now they wanted to help now they wanted to stand up and not stand to the side No Its not fair Why do they get to be saved while she had to suffer Rachel reached into her back pocket and pulled out a small pocket knife It was slightly dull yet still sharp enough to do damage They couldve been heroes all along but they waited till now They dont deserve to be heroes They dont deserve anything Fine Rachel said as the group turned towards her You win she said smiling with the pocket knife hidden in her hand She proceeded to walk up to Ezekiel quiet and unsuspecting She then took her pocket knife stabbed him in the stomach and twisted it like a key locking the door to life Ezekiel screamed as the others looked back and saw what she had done They started to run but with one having a sprained ankle and the other having severe asthma This was a game of survival of the fittest and at the top of the pyramid was Rachel Rachel knew damn well she wouldnt have to stab them in a place that would immediately kill them just in a place in which they would bleed out long enough to die She knew that Audrey would probably die of asphyxiation by the time she got to her so she began to run after Jackson his sprained ankle making him incredibly slow She giggled as she got closer and closer But suddenly it was silent Jackson stopped thinking she had ran the other way after Audrey He looked around and Rachel was nowhere in sight As he took a breath he suddenly felt something cold touch his back He winced as the knife pierced through his back watching his blood soak through his shirt Why Jackson cried He fell to the floor in pain looking up at Rachel You guys dont deserve to be heroes but I deserve to even the scales She stared at him with a sinister smirk I have finally learned how to swim but unfortunately you cant if youre dead Rachel walked away and started toward Audrey Fortunately for Rachel Audrey had made the poor decision to run away without an inhaler on hand She slowly walked up to her body collapsed on the floor wheezing and coughing Rachel looked over Audreys body laughing due to her being unable to catch her breath Wow the feeling of not being able to breathe must suck Rachel told her Audrey tried to gasp for words failing every time Tears rolling down her face Rachel crouched to the ground and put her hands sweetly on Audreys cheek and wiped her tears Rachel whispered You all might want me dead and believe me I want to be as well but it looks like Im still alive But dont worry its okay I can take you out of your misery Rachel then took her knife and slashed Audreys neck no different from opening a package creating a necklace of blood Shhhhhh There is no need to breathe in the underworld I have set you free Youre welcome She looked up and saw the house hearing the siren screams of those still inside She then glimpsed at the bodies she had killed and the body of the one who didnt deserve to die With her knife still in hand and her clothing covered in blood she slit her wrists and began laughing uncontrollably She then fell to the ground and stared at the sky above her the clouds coming and going and the sun shining bright She smiled as the world came to an end and her life

some thing blocked out the sun 2 mo ago I was there for the 2024 total Eclipse some thing blocked out the sun Now Ive never been one for conspiracies So when I heard that the 2024 solar eclipse was the end of the times I laughed it off Its just another attempt for the media to scare people I told my colleagues But they had fallen for it Just like the 2020 plague or the war overseas I always kept myself rational a down to earth individual who you can rely on in any dire situation Im an atheist and realist by nature Ive never bought into the paranormal Dogman sightings astrology astrophysics all that But my family was excited During 2017 a similar event took place and they all raved about it The cool glasses the alien themed festivals It was great I fortunately managed to avoid it all You see Im an underground technician within Indiana state prison Its not a glamorous job but I get benefits and paid vacation And thats enough for me But due to my anniversary taking up the last of my vacation days taking off wasnt in the cards during the Eclipse And Im thankful for that My wife expected for me to take off and enjoy it with her Once in a lifetime She said But work needed me And now here it is 2024 and a second Eclipse is taking place Once in a lifetime truly Even so I couldnt get out of it this time I had sick leave during our anniversary and well we didnt end up going anywhere Now Im being forced to celebrate some silly eclipse Now I know what an eclipse is An excuse for parents to get their kids out of the house barbecue go to the pool or just enjoy nature You put on silly glasses that make it look like the sun disappears I get the reasons and the nuance behind them but I absolutely hated wasting my time Im a man Im supposed to provide not sit around engaging in some silly festival that doesnt even have rides Once we got outside I could see my kids playing there was a warning on Fox News Dont look at the sun written in bold ink my eight year old child could have told you that but apparently the sheep who like to follow what they hear without ever picking up a news paper have gotten themselves blinded in the past Darwin doing his best work Here My wife said she offered me a pair of Eclipse classes I took them and stuffed them into my pocket she frowned at me but didnt protest Its all well and good for my wife and children to run around with ridiculous eyewear but me Im the man of the house Atleast one of us had to be presentable I sat down in my lawn chair admiring the crisp cut grass and manicured work My wife and children gathered with our neighbors They oohed and aahed at the sky The sun was as bright as ever to me Ridiculous But who am I to stop them I smiled softly Atleast theyre happy With that thought I began to read my paper It wasnt long before I noticed something the shadows on my lawn seemed to deepen as if solidifying into an abysmal mass I glanced up and noticed the sharpness of the shadows around me My families perspective shades appeared darker as if they intended to pull them in I stood up and thats when I noticed even the trees around our complex their shadows appear to spiral into a million fractals It was horrifying I stood for a long moment before darkness fell In a flash everything went black It was as if night had fallen in broad daylight What little light remained painted an eerie picture I looked up only to see a ring of light my mouth fell open in shock and disbelief What madness had befallen the world I had to get my family out of there I looked back only to see them laughing and cheering their glasses on oblivious to reality But as the ethereal colossus passed over head all I could do was stare It was as if an eye blinked And suddenly light returned I screamed and I ran It has been several hours now My family has changed they they dont believe me I locked myself in my bathroom and I dont know what to do But as the sun appears to be getting dimmer outside I can only offer this The Eclipse isnt a childrens story There is some thing blocking out the sun Upvote Downvote comments Share your short works of literature Welcome to the Reddit short story hub Write your

permanently disabled as a result Just to pile on 1 week after his accident my wife of 19 yrs was diagnosed with youre gonna die in 6 months breast cancer Well that sucks I was very fortunate that I had made myself a good living at a great company working for people I loved and who loved me They allowed me to take all the time I needed to get my loved ones situated I assumed any and all responsibility for my wife and my brother It was the only thing to do One day early on after he gets home I come over he tells me that his vacuum cleaner is broken Hes a clean freak I tell him That sucks No it doesnt Well hes got me there Shit I go to WalMart head to the household appliance section Fuk There are literally 25 different vacuums on the shelf Fuk I got no time for this shit After carefully weighing the pros and cons of each specific model I make a decision I begin celebrating this one little positive thing thats happened for awhile Im high fiveing myself silently dancing in the aisle on my way to bin 34 thinking to myself the whole way I am fucking awesome In troubled times one needs small victories I get to bin 34 to retrieve my prizeEmptySHIT Gloom Despair and Hopelessness all hit me at the same time My knees begin to buckle as I slowly collapse to the floor My only thoughts are to curl up in a ball in total surrender This is not going to be pretty Before my first tears hit the ground I notice on the box in the next bin over in big purple letters against the batmanlike yellow exploding graphic screaming Now with Continuous Suction Action My path was clear if I was gonna spend good money on a vacuum cleaner I want one that sucks all the time It seemed silly to buy one that only sucked some of the time 21 years later that vacuum still sucks Upvote

Stay Feedback is appreciated A melodical series of chirps accompanied by the rustling of leaves in the wind is interrupted by a set of light yet firm footsteps that put the rhythm to rest An ethereal figure bathes in the rays of the gentle sunlight She dons a dress made of leaves her hair cascading like a string of vines on a log of wood The nature around her perks up as she walks as if beckoning her presence A small squeak interrupts the womans walk her bright green eyes drifting down to the grass below her A pair of beady brown eyes stare back belonging to a small bundle of white fluff that bumps into her incessantly The woman coos and coddles the small rabbit like a mother would do to her baby opting to sit down to enjoy the small creatures company The woman plays and laughs to her hearts content mere minutes passing as she does so But since when did this small baby rabbit grow so big It can no longer fit comfortably in her hands A shimmer of gold peaks from around her peripherals The woman lifts her gaze from the rabbit to her surroundings Gold Everything has turned gold No longer are the trees and the bushes a vibrant green hue they now adorn the colours of Autumn Ah Time is such a fleeting thing is it not the woman speaks to not one individual but millions The trees the grass the rabbit at her feet the bird and her children in that tree over there She speaks to all of them and on behalf of all of them for she is Gaia Mother Nature Unlike most Gaia is unaffected by time and will remain alive as long as nature is also alive Gaia knows that creatures of flesh and blood will perish in the face of time Gaia knows that this rabbit at her feet will eventually succumb to deaths embrace and yet she cannot help but be saddened by this Gaia kneels down and embraces the rabbit before her savouring the warmth its body provides before it runs cold To her days are mere seconds and months are mere minutes It is Autumn No longer is there a musical tune being sung by birds nor is there a cacophony of leaves swaying in the wind Everyone must be preparing for the Winter as should you little one Gaia gently bids the rabbit goodbye only for it to stomp its foot anchoring itself in place Gaia urges for the small animal to seek shelter seek food for the Winter Many minutes pass as Gaia argues with the angry fluffball beside her its shiny white coat blending into its surroundingswhat Gaia curbs their argument and looks around her to see the golden hue of the trees have been drowned out by a sea of white Winter is here A wave of flakes blows past her as if afraid that it will harm her porcelain skin The Winter cold does not bother her nor does the summer sun for they are all apart of nature However the same does not apply for creatures of flesh and blood such as the poor trembling rabbit at her feet Gaia makes a vain attempt to shield the defenceless creature from the icy winds that assault its fragile body only to pull herself away She cannot directly intervene Gaia looks on helplessly the winter winds feeling awfully cold all of a sudden Gaia can do nothing but watch as the rabbit trembles in the middle of a turbulent storm of snow The rabbit can no longer move the deathly cold immobilising it Gaias body feels cold yet her face feels warm Why Gaia feels fresh hot tears dribble down her cheeks obscured green eyes meeting a pair of hazy brown eyes The rabbit is now on its side curled into a pitiful ball of fluff Although Gaia cannot physically touch the rabbit she can feel it The slowing symphony of this little ones heartbeat A sharp sensation slices through Gaias heart cutting though it like butter Gaias lip quivers as she helplessly watches on as the fire inside of the rabbits body dwindles with each passing moment Life is like fire brimming with colour and blazing with intensity But all it takes is for a single blow the roaring of the icy winds intensifies before slamming into the frail rabbit on the ground to snuff it out A scream claws its way out of the depths of Gaias throat ripping itself free Gaia can feel it in her body and in her soul She is now permitted to touch the animal no the corpse before her Gaia coddles the sunken chest of her fallen child to her own coddling it once more now that its warmth has run cold Gaia sits there crying into the rabbits snowtainted fur which for the first time felt like hours A small squeak interrupts the womans mourning Gaia lifts her tearstained face from the rabbits fur only to be met with a pair of beady brown eyes Gaias heart leaps out of her chest as a tiny bundle of fluff jumps into her arms Gaia looks around the trees and bushes have returned to their original vibrant green a familiar melodic piece being sung into the open air Spring has finally arrived A smile graces Gaias face a fond look passing over the pile of bones at her feet as she picks up the baby rabbit in her lap This is life Gaia knows that life and death go hand in hand unable to exist without each other Gaia knows that life is fleeting and that she mustnt intervene nor be perturbed by its end But Gaia cant help but always think back to Autumn specifically every time that this cycle repeats The calm before the storm the gold before the white She wipes her eyes Gaia isnt sad because she knows that Nothing Gold Can Stay Seeking Feedback

cobblestones of the Appian Way I pedaled my bicycle with determination sweat beading on my brow as my legs pumped furiously The rhythmic clicking of the gears and the hum of the tires on the road provided a comforting soundtrack to the macabre thoughts that consumed me I couldnt help but ponder the horrors endured by those crucified in ancient Rome their agonized screams echoing through time Such suffering I whispered to myself feeling an odd kinship with these longdead souls My heart raced as images of their torment filled my mind each more gruesome than the last As I rounded a curve my eyes were drawn to a curious sight a wooden pole protruding from the earth accompanied by a sturdy beam lying nearby The scene looked eerily familiar as if it had been plucked from my darkest musings and placed before me like some twisted stage set Is this I muttered dismounting my bicycle and approaching the strange sight The ground was uneven beneath my feet and I stumbled slightly as I drew closer my curiosity piqued Hello I called out unsure if someone might be nearby The wind rustled through the trees providing no answer I glanced back at my bike then turned my gaze once more to the wooden structure It seemed almost alive as though it held within it the memories of countless souls who had suffered upon it Could this really be a cross I wondered aloud my voice shaking with a mixture of fear and fascination The thought sent a shudder down my spine and I hesitated for a moment before reaching out a trembling hand to touch the rough wood Who would leave something like this here I asked myself unable to tear my eyes away from the haunting symbol of pain and suffering The wind picked up stirring the leaves around me and sending an inexplicable chill through my body Perhaps its a sign I murmured my thoughts racing with the possibilities What could this sudden encounter with such a potent symbol mean Was I meant to discover this relic or was it merely a cruel trick played by fate As I stood there transfixed by the sight before me I couldnt help but feel a strange connection to the crucifixion victims of long ago Their anguish seemed to resonate within me their cries echoing in the depths of my heart And though I knew the path forward would be fraught with pain and sorrow I felt compelled to explore this dark chapter of history further drawn inexorably toward the shadows that lay beyond the light I felt the rough texture of the beam beneath my fingertips and the air around me seemed to grow heavier with each passing moment Unable to resist the strange allure that pulsed from this grisly relic I made a decision that would forever haunt me Maybe maybe if I could just feel it for myself I whispered trembling as I peeled off my clothes until I stood there in my white briefs The wind bit at my exposed skin but I hardly noticed the anticipation of what was to come consumed me entirely Slowly deliberately I laid myself down upon the wooden beam stretching my arms outward as if they were being pinned to the cross by unseen nails The rough wood dug into my back but I welcomed the discomfort eager to experience even a fraction of the pain suffered by those who had come before me Closing my eyes I surrendered myself to the darkness within allowing my thoughts to drift back through the centuries to a time of unimaginable suffering a time when men and women were nailed to crosses and left to die in agony all in the name of justice Forgive me I murmured not knowing to whom I spoke but feeling the weight of my actions nonetheless Forgive you for what A deep mocking voice shattered the silence and I bolted upright my heart pounding in my chest But before I could make sense of what was happening the world around me shifted and I found myself in a place beyond my wildest nightmares Gone were the verdant hills and ancient ruins of the Appian Way Instead I am stripped of my clothes wearing only a white loincloth stretched out on the wooden beam that suddenly felt all too real The air was thick with the stench of blood and sweat and the sounds of weeping and cries of anguish filled my ears Whwhere am I I stammered my voice barely audible above the cacophony of suffering that surrounded me As I struggled to comprehend what was happening the grim reality of my predicament began to sink in I had been transported to the Roman era and I was about to be crucified The tears that welled up in my eyes were not only for the agony I would soon face but also for the foolish curiosity that had led me to this terrible fate A cold sweat drenched my skin as I gazed upon the grim visage of the Roman soldier approaching me his eyes devoid of mercy My breaths came in shallow gasps each inhale laced with fear and despair A cacophony of thoughts raced through my mind none offering any solace By the gods this cant be happening I muttered to myself desperately searching for a way out of this nightmare Silence barked the soldier brandishing a whip that cracked through the air just inches from my face Please I dont belong here I pleaded but my words fell on deaf ears They had made up their minds I was to be crucified like the others who shared my cruel fate Enough The centurions voice carried a tone of finality silencing my protestations My heart pounded in my chest as I watched the soldiers approach the prisoner next to me He trembled in terror struggling to maintain what little dignity he had left Please have mercy the man cried out his voice breaking under the weight of his anguish Mercy is for the weak sneered the soldier driving a heavy iron nail through the mans wrist and into the beams unforgiving wood His screams tore through the air echoing in my ears and searing themselves into my memory As I stared into the eyes of the man being hoisted onto the post beside me his feet nailed to the wood I couldnt help but feel a crushing sense of fear The moans of the crucified tore through the air like a symphony of suffering their anguish palpable as I glanced to my other side Row upon row of crosses lined the Appian Way each bearing its own pitiful cargo men writhing in pain stripped of their clothes and dignity Help me please one man begged his voice barely audible above the cacophony of despair His body slick with sweat and blood shuddered with each labored breath I closed my eyes trying to shut out the horrifying scene but the images were seared into my mind Keep moving a Roman soldier barked shoving the prisoners in front of me down the road Their shoulders slumped beneath the weight of the beams they bore their naked bodies covered in cuts and bruises They stumbled forward eyes downcast resigned to their fate Cant go on a prisoner at the head of the line gasped collapsing under the burden of his cross The Roman soldiers laughed cruelly kicking him until he struggled back to his feet Get up you filth Or well nail you right here one of them roared spittle flying from his lips The sun glared down mercilessly casting long grotesque shadows of the crucified men across the dusty road The scent of blood mingled with sweat filling my nostrils as I contemplated my own impending fate My heart hammered in my chest a mixture of fear and morbid fascination coursing through me Hey you a gruff voice shouted yanking me back to the present moment A burly Roman soldier pointed his finger directly at me his eyes narrowed with malice Your turn one of the soldiers growled at me Any last words Please listen Im not supposed to be here I choked out between ragged breaths but my desperate plea only elicited cruel laughter Neither are any of them he replied gesturing at the other prisoners awaiting their fate I opened my mouth to protest but before the words could escape the back of the soldiers hand collided with my face sending my head sprawling to the side The taste of blood filled my mouth as I struggled to regain my bearings Thought you could just watch did you another soldier sneered towering over me Think again Please I stammered my voice barely audible This is all a mistake Save it for someone who cares the first soldier spat He leaned in closer his breath heavy with the stench of wine Youre going up there whether you like it or not Look at him tremble the second soldier mocked grabbing a fistful of my hair and yanking my head back Maybe hell wet himself before we even get started Laughter erupted from the other soldiers their cruel taunts cutting through me like a blade Pathetic one of them jeered Just like the rest of these scum Leave me alone I cried out my fragile resolve crumbling away under the weight of their relentless torment But my pleas only seemed to amuse them further feeding their sadistic delight Your suffering has only just begun the first soldier whispered into my ear his voice dripping with menace By the time were done with you youll be begging for death The cold steel of the spike pressed against my right wrist sending shivers through my body My heart hammered in my chest as I looked into the eyes of the Roman soldier who held it Please I whispered but he ignored me and raised a hammer above his head Our eyes locked for a brief moment and then the hammer fell The agonizing shriek that tore from my throat was gutwrenching as the merciless spike impaled my trembling wrist pinning it brutally to the unforgiving wooden beam The searing pain was beyond comprehension sending shockwaves through my entire body I could feel hot tears streaming down my face and sobs racked my trembling form as I struggled against the relentless grip of agony Shut up the soldier barked grabbing my left arm and holding it in place My breaths came in short ragged gasps and my vision blurred from the agony Stop I choked out my voice barely more than a whisper Please stop Save your breath scum another soldier sneered Youll need it The hammer descended again and I couldnt hold back the scream that tore from my throat as the second spike penetrated my left wrist The world around me seemed to dissolve into a haze of redhot pain and I struggled desperately to remain conscious Alright lift him up one of the soldiers commanded and I felt hands gripping my body With a sudden jolt the weight of the crossbeam was lifted off the ground connecting it to the perpendicular post Suspended between heaven and earth I dangled by my wrists the pain from the spikes threatening to overwhelm me completely A barbarous chill descended upon my body as the soldiers fastened my feet one atop the other to the unforgivingly rough wood The first strike of the hammer sent an electric current of searing agony through me a shockwave that seemed to echo up into my skull And as each subsequent blow rained down the pain intensified to a scorching inferno engulfing every inch of my being in unrelenting torment Look at him now someone jeered their laughter dancing cruelly around me Not so tough anymore is he Letmedown I managed to gasp each word a struggle But my tormentors showed no sign of mercy their faces twisted into expressions of cold callous amusement Get used to it one of them sneered Youll be here for a while As I hung there powerless and in agony the cruel laughter of the Roman soldiers echoing in my ears my mind raced with thoughts of despair and helplessness What had I done to deserve such a fate Was there truly no hope of escape from this nightmare The sun blazed mercilessly above me its rays searing my exposed skin as I hung from the cross My feet throbbed with unbearable pain their soles pierced by long cruel spikes that pinned me to the wood Each labored breath felt like an impossible battle against the weight of shame and suffering crushing my chest The coarse splinters of the wooden cross bit into my flesh each minute movement sending fresh waves of agony through my body Look at you now a Roman soldier sneered his face twisted with sadistic delight Begging for mercy wont save you I tried to ignore him focusing instead on the task of drawing air into my lungs My chest was so constricted that every inhalation felt like a Herculean effort Desperation clawed at my throat suffocating me further as I gasped weakly for breath Cant even speak I managed to choke out my voice barely audible amid the groans and cries of my fellow prisoners Ha the soldier barked amused by my pathetic display Dont waste your breath scum Youll need it As the minutes dragged on the pain in my wrists and feet intensified threatening to consume me entirely Yet somehow I clung to consciousness unwilling to surrender to the darkness that beckoned at the edges of my vision Please the man beside me whimpered his own suffering evident in his strained voice Have mercy Mercy another soldier roared his laughter harsh and mocking You expect mercy from us Youre nothing but filth beneath our boots Stay strong I urged myself silently desperately trying to block out the soldiers taunts Youve made it this far Dont give them the satisfaction But as the hours wore on my resolve began to waver The unrelenting pain combined with my increasingly desperate struggle for breath threatened to break me completely I was no longer certain I could endure this torment any longer Gods I prayed silently if youre listening give me the strength to survive this hell As I hung there suspended between heaven and earth I knew that I had reached a crossroads Would I allow my tormentors to triumph or would I find some way to persevere through the unimaginable agony Only time would tell The sun bore down on us relentless and unforgiving I squinted against its glare my vision blurred by the sweat that stung my eyes The grim tableau of crucified prisoners extended in both directions our collective suffering amplified by the stark nakedness that left us exposed to the elements and the jeering eyes of our captors Please a man to my left choked out his voice barely audible over the cacophony of groans and sobs that filled the air I beg you let me down The Roman soldiers sneer twists into a malicious grin as he towers over the writhing man at his feet His eyes are ice cold devoid of any empathy or mercy as they rake over the pitiful figure before him Ha Want down now do you He taunts relishing in the mans agony You should have thought twice before following that traitor Spartacus and daring to challenge the might of Rome My heart clenched with pity for the poor soul beside me but I had no words of comfort to offer Each breath was a battle my lungs straining against the constriction of my chest My thoughts were consumed by the agonizing pain that shot through every nerve fire licking at my flesh where the splinters of the cross dug into my skin Look at them squirm another soldier barked his laughter low and malicious Like worms on a hook Pathetic his comrade agreed spitting at our feet Nothing but filth Gods above I prayed silently my voice little more than a whisper in my own head Give me the strength to endure this or grant me the mercy of death A sudden gust of cold wind jolted me back to reality My eyes slowly opened and my vision cleared revealing that I was lying with my hands extended on top of a wooden beam Was it all just a dream I whispered my voice shaking My body trembled with the aftershocks of the ordeal sweat dripping down my brow Get a grip I muttered to myself pulling my clothes towards me As I dressed the vividness of what Id just experienced continued to haunt me each agonizing moment playing out in my minds eye The taste of blood and humiliation lingered in my mouth my wrists still throbbing as if they bore ghostly wounds Ridiculous I scoffed trying to brush away the lingering thoughts as I fastened my belt and stepped into my shoes It was only a dream Excuse me are you alright A passerby called out his concerned gaze fixating on my disheveled state I must have looked like a madman sprawled on the ground and drenched in sweat Uh yeah I stammered forcing a smile Just needed a moment to rest thats all The man appeared bewildered as he saw me lying on the ground my arms spread wide wearing nothing but white briefs I couldnt help but feel embarrassed and ashamed Okay then he replied hesitantly clearly not convinced Take care Thanks I managed giving him a weak nod before mounting my bicycle With a deep breath I pushed off pedaling hard to distance myself from the eerie site that had triggered my nightmare Or had it been something more As I cycled my thoughts churned relentlessly struggling to make sense of my ordeal Had I somehow tapped into the collective memory of those who had suffered such a brutal fate Or was my imagination simply running wild fueled by my morbid fascination with the past Does it even matter I asked myself my voice barely audible against the wind You lived through it whether in your mind or some strange twist of reality Either way I continued my determination rising like a phoenix from the ashes of despair I wont let this experience define me I will use it to fuel my understanding and empathy for those who have suffered and to remind myself that life is precious and fleeting Never again I vowed my eyes locked on the horizon as I pedaled faster and faster will I take life for granted Never again I whispered my voice carried away by the wind will I forget the lessons learned from the crucifixion Upvote Downvote comments The Incident at Gallows Hill The Incident at Gallows Hill The children of Salem visited Gallows Hill on a night when the moon was as thin and sharp as a barbers blade They were after a snip of hair where it was said witches held their magic Everyone knew Mary was a witch It was proven when her neck resisted the quick snap of the hangmans deadfall She writhed and trembled for nearly twenty minutes before her body hung lifeless Many witches hung in Salem that year but it was Charlie who eventually spoke up with the dare of taking a witchs lock And on a still autumn night they snuck away from their beds and into the woods Charlie leading with his mothers scissors and a small glass jar Charlies courage left him when he saw the silhouette hanging from the tall oak the figure swayed with its head cocked queerly to the right Fear weighed in his footsteps The thought of his mothers voice warm and loving called him back to the safety of his bed but she went silent as he felt burning stares of the children behind him They measured his courage in each frozen second the word coward echoing in his mind He put the scissors between his teeth and started to climb the oaks trunk An earthy rotlike smell greeted him as he inched his way onto the hanging branch Ahead was the rope the ghoulish figure hanging below He steadied himself above the corpse trying not to think of the head tilted at that awful angle of a hidden hags grin waiting for his hand to leave the branch A gust of wind howled through the leafs causing him to pause and hug against the rough bark For a moment he thought he saw the witchs head turn just a little He watched her carefully until the body again held still Steadying himself he gathered his courage and reached out shyly with the scissors Other children would later recount that they saw Mary reach up and grab Charlie in the moonlight but they fled in horror too quickly to be certain Charlies body was found the next morning at the foot of the tree His neck was broken An empty jar and a pair of scissors lay at his side No snip of hair was found Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments STATIC HORRORMYSTERY uGirik1234 avatar uGirik1234 STATIC HORRORMYSTERY NOTE MARKS A SCENE CHANGE The moon loomed overhead bathing the massive expanse of the forest with its light The scent of damp grass wafted through the air as fireflies sparkled in the darkness of the forest Kuntal Mondal the forest ranger silently made his way through the forest his eyes scanning the environment In one part of the pines and firs a small clearing could be seen Within the clearing stood a bunch of weathered tents They were marred with yellowish stains while the bonfire beside the tents danced with the breeze Kuntal squinted after noticing that many things were scattered around the clearing including clothes sticks beer cans and also a solitary walkie talkie He was frustrated with the whole thing Not only had these people illegally camped in the forest but they had also left a mess Kuntal took slow calculated steps towards the walkie talkie making sure he didnt make a sound He pocketed the walkie talkie hoping that someone could reply from the other end Is anyone there he said through the device eyeing the trees around him He could have sworn that he saw something there I repeat can anyone hear me Suddenly a Pit Pat echoed from the depths of the forest Pulling out his handgun Kuntal jerked himself towards the direction of the sound expecting someone to lunge out of the depths Sweat trickled from his forehead as he heard more Pit Pats in front of him He gasped as a strange figure materialized from the distance The creature towered over Kuntal its massive bulk casting a long ominous shadow across the clearing Its body was disproportionately large with thick muscular limbs that seemed capable of crushing anything in their path It crawled on all fours its limbs all twisted and contorted while its slimy skin filled the air with a horrid stench Its massive mouth opened revealing many protruding jagged teeth ready to engulf Kuntal He wasted no time before firing his handgun yelling loudly for help The creature was taken aback by the gunshots that pierced its body but it made no signs of retreat With no other choice he took out a flare lit it with blurring speed and held it up his hands trembling The creature stopped momentarily recognizing the heat of the flare but it continued towards Kuntal with a deafening highpitched scream Kuntal took a few steps back before throwing the flare directly into the creatures mouth In an instant the creatures screams filled the air as it scrambled helplessly all over the place Kuntal gasped as he saw the belly slowly expanding Kuntal did not want to experience the sight anymore He wheeled himself around before running fullspeed into the forest not heeding the pain in his hips He did not know where he was going but as long as he was out of that things reach it was alright As he ran through the forest avoiding bumping into trees he heard a deafening explosion from behind which was followed by sounds of many things dropping to the ground each impact making a gross slimy sound Kuntal looked behind him and gagged the creature had blown up into a thousand pieces its slimy remains scattered throughout the ground some even stuck on tree branches More slime oozed out of the scattered pieces filling the air with a stench akin to one of rotten eggs That thing exploded Kuntal said grossed out by the whole ordeal He was glad to be alive for he had only heard stories of other rangers encountering the beast but he had never faced it himself Kalikan Forest was known for stories regarding strange creatures like whatever Kuntal had faced But skeptics had never believed stuff like this always countering the tales by questioning the absence of carcasses photographic evidence and successful expeditions meant to find these creatures However Kuntal knew better as did the other rangers of the forest They were well aware that these creatures were intelligent capable of hiding themselves when necessary The lack of photographic evidence was mainly due to the fact that no one survived encounters to take pictures and even if they did they never returned to share them Furthermore if these skeptics denied the existence of these creatures then nothing could explain the cause of the many disappearances throughout the years Still Kuntal had only been here for a week so encountering something like that put him off quite a bit despite hearing the stories from other rangers Kuntal had run quite a long distance before he aligned himself with a trail a mud path leading to a watchtower in the distance It loomed over the forest casting a long shadow across it This was Tower Moonshine one of the three ranger towers in Kalikan forest and this one belonged to Kuntal He rushed to the watchtower brushing the sweat off his face before starting to climb the spiraling staircase that led to the viewing deck of the tower I have to warn the others he thought as he raced through the stairs his hips begging him to stop I should have never gone there alone When he had finally reached the top of the tower he took in deep breaths trying to cleanse the memory of what had just happened his heart pounding on his ribcage He took a brief rest letting his hip pain subside before he went into the interior turning the doorknob with his sweaty palms The ceiling lights cast its glow over the room illuminating it A small bed was tucked away in one of the corners while a large table was placed on another side On it lay a computer a large radio and a coffee machine while many crumpled sheets of paper lay scattered on the floor mingled with soda cans and water bottles Kuntal booted up the radio its static buzzing through the air Is anyone there This is Tower Moonshine come in he began with a shaky voice Is anyone there I got bad news This is Ranger Tower Riverine What is the problem Kuntal replied a voice through the static Kuntal let out a sigh glad that someone had responded Mike the camp I went to search it was empty Kuntal said recalling the strange sight And then this happened He proceeded to explain the whole encounter with the creature even recalling the memory caused him to tremble The other ranger calmly listened till he had finished Are you sure that you have not lost your mind Mike said his voice carrying the tone of worry rather than skepticism Kuntal answered rather angrily No and if you doubt me then I have wasted your time Kuntal was simply frustrated He feared that nobody would believe him but he had to try Look I do not doubt you Mike said sadly I was simply concerned Plus we already knew that stuff like this roams around the forest Now if what you say is true then we have to warn Pralay Did you bring any evidence of the fat boy It will be harder to convince the Pralay without it considering that hes new Fat boy Mike this is serious Kuntal said his anger rising And no I did not get any evidence However I did get a walkie talkie from the campsite Have you tried to get a reply from the other end I tried but thats when the thing stepped in Let me give it another shot Hold on Kuntal took out the walkie talkie and said If anyone can hear me please reply Come in can anyone hear me Shivers went down Kuntals spine as a shaky gravelly voice came from the talkie Hello Derek are you there What the hell happened Kuntal hesitated for a moment before saying This is not Derek we are the forest rangers Tell us where you are we saw your bonfire near the camp but no one was there Where is Derek How do we get to the den Just tell us where you are We will come and find you And what is this den If we knew where we were we would have got to the den already Screw you man We are gonna try to get back to camp Wait no Dont return to the camp Kuntal yelled desperately but the connection was cut leaving the room in silence except for the sound of the wind beating at the windows Well that did not go well Mike let out a audible sigh I am gonna warn Pralay Good night Kuntal Good night Kuntal said grimly putting his hands over his forehead He thought that he could have handled that conversation better Fear crept over him as he retired to sleep It had been a long day and despite all of the things that had happened he quickly broke into a deep slumber Dreams swirled in his mind dreams of a strange creature akin to the one he had seen before with the only difference being that the creature was smaller There were numerous of them looking towards him curiously Slowly they closed in around him leaving him no chance for escape He let out a scream as the creatures lunged at tearing him into pieces He scrambled around before suddenly he fell into the void Kuntal woke up realizing that he had fallen into the floor His heart was beating at a intense speed while his brain was still processing the meaning of the nightmare The sunlight crept in through the window grasping Kuntal with his warm hand Birds chirped noisily outside mingled with the gentle rustle of leaves The combined scent of grass and flowers filled his nostrils immediately easing his heart Nature was the only thing keeping him going in this strange forest The peace was shortlived however as the radio started to beep Kuntal rushed to turn it on filling the air with static This is Ranger Tower Moonshine what is it he said waiting expectantly but no answer came This is Ranger Tower Moonshine come in This is Ranger Tower Riverine Kuntal what is it You woke me up man No I did not broadcast the signal Mike Was it you Pralay No answer came Come in Ranger Tower Hillside are you there Pralay are you there Kuntal said once again receiving no answer If he does not pick up the radio I will slap him when I see him next time Hes probably sleeping Mike said laughing at Kuntals outburst Anyways did you get anything else out of the walkie talkie I slept early yesterday Kuntal said shivers going down his spine He did not want to recall the dream again But who was broadcasting to the radio I dunno it probably picked up some random frequency Before Kuntal could reply a shaky and gravelly voice spoke through the radio We have found the den Derek We stole the rangers stuff and it was enough for supplies and Martin helped us with it I hope you are hearing this Derek Please come to the den quickly its just beside the river we discussed about in camp I will leave you a map at this tower if you are lost The connection cut off before anyone could reply leaving Kuntal to be puzzled I have a really bad feeling about this There was a long pause Kuntal did not like this at all Not only were these people avoiding them they had also apparently stolen supplies from rangers Mike finally broke the silence and said We need to check on Pralay They said something about stealing stuff from rangers Meet me at Tower Hillside Later that evening Kuntal had reached Tower Hillside which was a couple of miles away from his tower There he met Mike standing near the staircase leading to the viewing deck He was looking up at the tower with a gun in his hand Kuntal took out his own gun before looking up at the tower The towers light came through the windows illuminating the surroundings slightly A bone chilling mist raced through the air making Kuntal shiver Something isnt right Mike said sniffing at the air Kuntal had not realized it before but a horrid smell wafted through the air resembling the stench of rotten eggs Come on Kuntal Stay behind me I dont want you to get hurt No I will lead Kuntal objected but Mike had already started ascending up the stairs With each step Kuntal grew increasingly alarmed tightening his grip on the gun When they finally reached the viewing deck Mike stopped Kuntal with his arm stretched out Stay there he said before taking slow deliberate steps towards the open door Shivers went down Mikes spine as he looked inside the room The bed cover was torn apart with cotton spilling from the pillowsYellowish stains marred the walls and the chair lay upturned one of its legs broken The tables usually equipped with radios and a computer were completely devoid of these things However a strange piece of paper lying on the floor caught his attention Kuntal You might wanna see this Kuntal gasped entered into the chaotic room and wanted to comment about it but Mike stopped him and handed him the piece of paper Kuntal furrowed his brows as he realized that it was a map of the forest with a particular point near the river marked with a red dot This must be the den that they were talking about said Kuntal stroking his chin but Mike was concerned about something else Where was Pralay Surely he did not let himself be captured by whoever ravaged the place Pralay must be in that den and so are the thieves he said to himself Should I really risk going there or just leave it to the authorities No Mike Kuntal replied shaking his head Bringing the authorities into this mess means bringing questions to us And we already know that they aint going to believe a single thing about my story Mike let out a deep sigh before stepping out onto the viewing deck Suddenly a small creature very similar to the one Kuntal had seen before popped out of the shadows lunging at Mike with terrifying force Mike got knocked over and he started to wrestle with the creature SHIT Kuntal cried aiming his gun at the scrambling creature It was too risky to shoot he could hurt Mike Hold still Mike The creature enlarged its mouth revealing the set of jagged teeth slime oozing out of its body Kuntals heart skipped a beat as he shot at the creature hoping that it would not hurt Mike The bullet found its mark piercing through the slimy body yet it seemed relatively unfazed only giving a glance towards Kuntal But in that very instant Mike used all his strength to lift the creature up and drop it onto the ground below How he managed to lift it up he did not know himself It exploded into many pieces on impact its slimy parts splattered all over the ground Kuntal let out sigh relieved to see Mike safe Mike snarled as he brushed off the oozy slime off his shirt This is a mess How did it even get up here he said eyeing the creatures decrepit corpse Are you hurt Kuntal asked not heeding Mikes question No dont worry about me Kuntal We have to find Pralay and see what these fools are up to We need to investigate that den It is our duty to save him No Kuntal said raising his voice Mike dont you see how dangerous this is It will be foolish to even try something like that Let them be I am going away from here I will be giving my resignation tomorrow morning After all we have been through Mike began clenching his jaw You decide to leave me here alone Why Are you not resigning too Mike Surely you understand how unsafe this is Yes Mike said glaring at him I understand how dangerous this is But it is our duty to save Pralay we cant just leave him out there We dont even know if hes alive Mike Kuntal cried He did not want to spend a day more in this forest after seeing all these attacks Lets just leave Mike Do you remember when we signed up and the employer said that the last rangers only lasted a week Whats to say that they met the same fate There was a short pause Mike stared at Kuntal lowering his brows I will go to the den Thats final Kuntal shook his head slowly As your friend I cant leave you here I will come but if we cant find Pralay then we go back immediately Then lets begin Mike said starting to descend down the steps The moon was shrouded by dark clouds thunder reverberating through the air Small drops of rain showered on the forest creating many puddles of water throughout the ground The rain created constant ripples on the river flowing beside the forest while frogs croaked loudly singing their song The rain splattered on Kuntals face brought by the chilly wind Mike was in front of him scaling through the environment and getting his feet stuck in the muddy ground Damn the rain he cried loudly receiving a angry shush from Kuntal As they got closer they could see a small opening on the side of a large rockface sticking out of the ground Kuntals heart fastened its pace as he saw drops of slime dripping from the top of the opening He wanted to turn back but kept going lead by Mikes undying fire of determination Mike entered the cave while Kuntal followed hesitantly As soon as he stepped inside his shoe got stuck in the slimy booze splattered on the floor He struggled to get it out eventually leading him to leave the shoe and carry on barefooted They cautiously moved past the slimy mess before they were greeted by the darkness Mike took out his flashlight and the the beam of light further into the cave Mike narrowed his brows as he the flashlight revealed a long tunnel with more slime stuck on the ceiling They barely fit into the tunnel making their way through it half bent Kuntal felt the wall closing in on him tight spaces were not kind to him His breath felt labored while his ears seemed to catch strange Pit Pat noises mingled with the Drip Drop of water As they made their way the tunnel got increasingly humid with sweat trickling from their faces their shirts more wet from their sweat than the shower of rain they had been through before If Pralay is here Kuntal thought He wont be alive Kollas looked back at the way he came from and felt a pull towards it yet he kept going Suddenly Mike stopped leading Kuntal to bump into him What is it Kuntal whispered his voice echoing through the air Why did you stop Mike turned back his eyes widened he held out the badge of Pralay the embossed copper gleaming under the flashlights influence He must be here somewhere whispered Mike pocketing the badge He proceeded to walk through the tunnel but Kuntal was hesitant Not only was the tunnel growing increasingly smaller it was also getting hotter Still he went on After what felt like hours of stumbling they finally reached the end Little did they know that the opening would lead them to the most sinister place imaginable Mike swiftly crawled out of the opening followed by Kuntal Kuntal panted for a while It had not been easy crawling through that tunnel But instead of inhaling fresh air a horrid stench greeted him instead Kuntal stumbled back as he saw what the flashlight illuminated Dozens no hundreds of spherical blobs were clustered throughout the cavern Slime hung on the ceiling in thin strands their nets supporting more clustered blobs Kuntal gasped as he noticed that the blobs housed tiny creatures which were a miniature version of the creatures they had encountered before Mike simply stood there frozen in place with his hand covering his mouth Beautiful isnt it a familiar voice said Kuntal and Mike took a few steps back noticing a young blondehaired lady her voice was the one they heard from the walkie talkie So Derek did not come It was a shame really Who are you Mike demanded his hands near the gun strap And what is all of this added Kuntal Oh this she said casually pointing to the clusters of blobs Why they are eggs of course Eggs You mean that this is the home to those damn creatures Kuntal said feeling frustrated himself And what hand do you have behind all of this Why did you come here I thought that was quite clear she said her voice musically toned I wanted to visit Derek and all of his friends So I set out with a couple of my friends to visit him Who is Derek Well that is what saddens me she said her smile turning into a frown You killed him Blew him up with that flare or atleast thats what his brothers say Mike and Kuntal stood there frozen in shock The silence intensified the sound of multiple splotchy footsteps reaching their ears Kuntals breath caught in his throat as he saw numerous of the small creatures surround them their fat slimy bodies glistening under the flashlights influence while their teeth shone brightly Nothis cant be Mike stuttered looking at all of the creatures What have you done to Pralay Oh Pralay You mean the ranger Well he was the payment for Dereks death Here he is The creatures brought out a twisted contorted body with its organs exposed blood spewing out of the body The blood mingled with the slime inflating strange blobs of slime their cells interchanging with each other to form clusters of blobs One death gives the rise to many lives the lady said smiling menacingly Kuntal gagged feeling his heart drum intensely while Mike broke into a run going back towards the tunnel opening but it was too late Mike was surrounded by the creatures as they circled around him with great pace slowly closing in Kuntal let out a horrified yell as the creatures extended their jaws tearing Mike apart in a thousand pieces Hundreds of blobs sprouted out of Mikes decrepit corpse as tears streamed down Kuntals cheek This is where your story ends ranger Youre just a pawn in a much bigger game Ive been tending to these creatures for years and theyll only get stronger Your role may be over but youll still serve my purpose Youll help me spread these mutated creatures far and wide Kuntal yelled desperately as the creatures closed in upon him bringing him to his demise And with his death his story remained unfinished with no echo of his memory remaining That was not everything The lady collapsed onto the floor her eyes widened Hundreds of the tiny creatures tore out of her body slime oozing out of her nostrils and ears More creatures came out of Mikes decrepit corpse The creatures met in the middle with them rhythmically speaking in a high pitched voice They spoke in their own language but I will tell you what they said You have done well the group that came out of the ladys body said to the other group that came out out of Mikes body What was the rangers name again Oh right Mike Yes Mike did well we controlled his mind just enough to bring the other ranger here Anyways once they hire the next ranger make sure to settle yourselves on one of their minds They proceeded to chant in a chorus their voiced echoing through the air THANKS FOR READING Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments The Mango The Mango There was once a man who was bet a million dollars to shove a mango up his ass It was said as a joke of course even within a room full of many others and barely ten minutes after it was said everyone in the room completely forgot about it But the man got home that night and he was laying in bed unable to sleep with a million dumb thoughts floating in his mind like a windmill And suddenly the dumbest thought of them all came back to mind Could he truly shove a mango up his ass he thought Is it even possible So despite the time being 11 pm he got out of bed and he found a single open bodega and there was a single mango left there yellow and ripe He thought it was quite magical and a coincidence of great meaning He went home and got down in the shower bending over on all fours and put lots of lube on the mango But the mango simply wouldnt fit up his ass So he rinsed the mango off in the shower water cut it up and started to eat it Waste not he thought Shortly afterward nibbling on the seed an idea struck him A seed he could easily fit up there So he shoved the seed up there and he went to sleep The next morning he bought some grow lights which were battery powered and also shoved them up his ass Soon afterwards a whole mango had grown right there inside of his ass A magical experience Growing something so complex and beautiful inside of himself He went up to that joker from the beginning of all this and pulled down his pants and directed the joker to stick his finger up inside of there Reticently he did He felt a mango up there And a million dollars was given to the man right that very moment Unfortunately for the man what couldnt go in also could not go out and he quickly developed a bowel obstruction requiring an emergent bowel operation That alone cost thousands of dollars in care and lost time But the problems he inherited from this operation cost him much moreexactly one million dollars over the course of his life So the man in the end came out with nothing but the experience of having a mango in his ass an experience of which he always looked back on and smiled which changed his philosophy and altered the course of his life And on his deathbed his last memory in this realm was about growing that mango inside of his ass and he left this Earth thinking his life was quite fruitful Upvote Downvote comments Short story Short story Can anyone help me with the formatting of the short story

of the water the scream of strained muscle begging to be free from resistance Keons rifle clicked empty There near the bank Your turn Hurry up before they reach the wall Keon took the light Seo Joon picked up his rifle aiming unsteadily Hed never shot anyone Make this shot farm boy and you can have one of my rice balls Keon said smiling The outline of a womans face came into focus as Seo Joon steadied his aim He pulled the trigger and watched her fall and roll lifeless into the river Well well Not bad Keon said handing him his reward Seo Joon sank his teeth into the rice a feeling of horror and hate muted by his own growling stomach Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments The Man The Man Here is the man Drifting through the vast emptiness of space where his only spectacle are a multitude of twinkling stars He floats in the void ragged and tired though was born with an undeniable power he himself cannot wish to comprehend Wrapped with linen cloth what once was his willing spirit is now scattered into fragments of a lost boy Here is the man His folks are known to lights of the world but in truth his mother was a musician now dead and his father a reckless drunk The life as damaged as his was rot with death and destruction And now he lays there staring vacantly at his ancestors turned into magnificent balls of flame Hatred fear and death permeate in his conscious heart still in him is hope Here is the man He sees the stars fall from the far east The night you were born 73 his father told They called them the PERSEIDS Your mother and I saw you as our miracle boy The man follows the falling stars with a tear streaming down His father never spoke the mothers name altogether the man does not bother He had a brother in that world hell never see again But in him carried the legacy of a blues lover and in him carried optimism and a brighter outlook Here is the man and hes neither big nor strong but in him brews already the eagerness to save the world from its demise Though outwardly his soul is shattered inwardly he is renewed Hope coursing through him around him He will win For the lives he lost he will win For the lives he killed he will win Beyond the grave he will win He is the harbinger of good news The presence beyond worlds And those who witness will stare in awe saying BEHOLD HERE IS THE MAN BOBBY FACE I do apologise for the name drop lol Im planning on using this for one of my books And if youre wondering yes this was inspired by the opening monologue in Blood Meridian Seeking Feedback Upvote Downvote comments My Fathers Before Me My Fathers Before Me Seeking Feedback rHFY My Fathers Before Me good chance of onion ninjas I found the chest when I was seven playing in the house while my mother tended the family garden My father had left before sunrise as he did one day every year I never thought to ask where he went on that day school had just let out and summer was on its way in the adventures with my friends were more important to me Summer was short and school would return before we knew it Plastic sword in hand prepared to defend my ship I walked through the house looking for stowaways and found the treasure in my parents closet Gold coins attached to ribbons placed neatly in a wooden box with a silver necklace carrying an angel and another necklace bore my Fathers name on two plates between them a casing battered and dull My Fathers treasures were so great why hide them Resting underneath the wooden box was a green jacket folded neatly and proud a patch on the sleeve ringed in bright red and a thin border of white in the shape of the plates that bore my Fathers name There was an odd knife in the center the blade held high from two snow capped mountains eight stars at the top three on one side of the knife five on the other Below was an eagle on a green shield Shinny brass buttons held the coat closed each had an eagle with stars above its head the talons held arrows in one claw a branch in the other and a banner in its beak Pins on the lapels read support on a blue banner silver hands held an eight pointed red star On the right were little rainbow ribbons pinned above the pocket bronze leaves on a few stars on some more a knotted cord on crimson and white an M on cream and light blue a 4 on blue yellow and red What did these mean The right side had our last name below a red arrow that held a ships wheel and a shield with a winged wheel Spearhead of Logistics scrolled beneath On that sleeve a black tab Airborne stitched in gold and a bald eagle screaming on a black shield I put on my Fathers coat and found another underneath The shoulders bore white diamonds ivy leaves at the corners The ribbons were as bright but different in pattern Green and yellow with three red stripes green and white with a silver scroll read 69 something that had not ended Another coat rested beneath that one and another further still all smartly packed away but ready to be donned again I put them all back the way I had found them my Fathers treasures were vast but were hidden for a purpose At dinner that night the colors and symbols still danced in my mind Dad what does Airborne mean That was the first time I saw my father cry My mothers eyes went wide but my father just shed tears his dinner forgotten You were in the closet werent you He asked How did he know Mom had not seen me and hed been gone all day I placed everything back where I had found it to the best of my knowledge Ill tell you tomorrow He said and picked up his plate before walking to the kitchen I couldnt sleep that night Was I in trouble What would he say The minutes ticked by like hours the silent darkness passed uninterrupted until the first light of day peaked through my window He knocked softly at my door no time was left for worry and fear The door opened and my father looked down at me still tucked into bed The coat I discovered hung proudly from his shoulders as he sat on my bed Get up and get ready he spoke softly today you will walk with me I pulled on my pants and threw my shirt over my head before picking up my shoes and entering the living room My grandfather was there wearing the second coat I found A tear in his eye as he looked down on me Kind of soon for him isnt it My grandfather asked He has to know sooner or later My father replied We walked across town my father on my right his father on my left laughing and talking about when my father was young People stopped to watch this little parade silent and knowing the truth I was about to learn On the edge of the town was the graveyard grey markers on a field of green but a flag flew proudly in front of a few This is where my father went once a year just before June This is my father my grandfather said in front of a stone polished and carved with our family name My father handed me a gold dollar like the one in his hand My grandfather place a gold dollar on the stone and stepped back to salute My father followed him every action the same and I knew what to do On the way home we stopped at a diner for breakfast People would pass to say thank you between bites of pancakes and eggs My father only nodded and my grandfather smiled I knew nothing needed to be said in reply and my Fathers treasures took on more meaning than gold and silver ever would The thunder of artillery rolls across this new world far from the star that I knew as a child My grandfather rests next to his father now in that green field of stones so far away My father still walks across town to lay a coin on their markers and when I get home from this world I will join him My faith is in my rifle and the armor I wear The man and the woman beside me are more precious than money or power The adventures of my youth are replaced by the realities in front of me as we fight for a treasure more valuable than gold and silver a future for our own sons and daughters a legacy we will give them like my fathers before me 276 upvotes 33

looked back on the town as the water receded the town or lack there of showed it self nothing left no buildings the port gone just a patch of mud with so little debris floating out to sea So much worse than anything the Scylla ever did MAY BREEZE The warm air filled the may sky Outside there was a quiet corner It was filled with people reading writing and even drawing Every once and awhile different kids would come over and talk to friends Teachers stood watching the students move around making the loudest of noise But of course the quietest spot was the reading corner All the quiet kids some were with friends having quiet conversations Some were reading in pairs others independently But when that cold breeze would come the trees rustled Grass swayed and hair moved in front of focused faces just to be quickly moved away to be able to continue reading One more chapter was probably the most said thing besides shh The teachers would come in check in every so often just to have to walk back to siting and enjoying the peace Napalm It felt frustrating in Chongqing I was rather stuck in Hechuan I got accustomed to lajiao spice there I was a Midwesterner at the age of 22 I was raised in Illinois I became a manica Ferris wheel on fireI was hiding under a bed in a hotel Bold like napalm Sometimes I can never stop Even when I was 18 in a ward arguing with staff Always want to fight things Thats why I refused the meds and went on a plane from America to China I was going to be an English teacher And like a light switch the change and SSRIs turned me into a mess It would be my first time experiencing psychosis My biggest issue I never imagined I would be stuck illegally in a country suffering a psychotic episode in my early twenties Transplanted as pollen I was left with a backpack and a cellphone With a downloaded app called WeChat I had arrogantly quit a university job in a fit Spent the past months full of energy and not sleeping and neglecting myself including not eating to work on a novel Not considering myself normally religious I had obsessed over occult ideas during that time Spending nights reading Aleister Crowleyhaven taken a rusty pocket knife to carve a pentagram on my chest for spiritual protection I did not have funds to fly home My visa was connected to my previous job which meant I had now made it void I was an illegal resident now in China I used a nifty app called WeChat as a messaging app it allows users to find people near them that are also looking for others It was like a virtual pond All kinds of people including sex workers trying to make things happen It could with luck be used to find people looking for people in terms of other kinds of work It was helpful on many occasions for finding gigs working at English training schools and also finding work as a private tutor for people WeChat also works as a digital wallet Mania makes me irritable Enough to tell a boss to fuck off Thoughts ricochet within me Bumper cars collide Being stuck and angry sucks I scrolled and scrolled on a Huawei phone Absolutely pissed off at this world Pissed at the times police wanted to take me away for being a mess Sometimes women get pissed Scrolling through their phones Angry at their cheating husbands It really is not that hard to have flairbe a damn white oddity Like moths to a porchlight Particles of sand through hands This is when I first started the habit of it I rather go by a rather empty name of Taishen with further explanation needed but now is not convenient But I assure it is interesting enough and has some importance Habits are various in nature in how they attach to and eat at marrowlike atom bombs flashing as rays evaporating DNAsets in a way less than human as putting myself in the cage of bad things taken upmy time as a former heroin addict is left as stretch marks on me in various ways The same goes for the first time I found myself making arrangements with middle aged married women while desperation of waves whiplashed me like sandpaper hands coming at me to leave me in a tiring state of abrasion I had spent a night snuck away into a hotel Found someone on a business trip Instead of registering I waited to sneak along into the hotel elevator amongst a group of others attending the hotel as I had no card I headed to a designated room number Originally I was sitting in a park Playing on WeChat and found someone in their midthirties Pictures were exchanged and I said no She brought up paying for the hotel if I arrived I agreed and went along When I met I washed up after her and we used our phones to awkwardly translate what we would do Room service knocked I found myself hidden under a bed as I was not registered to be there It seems unusual that it was around this time I had started working on a story of my life as a heroin addict when I got caught up in my worse manic episode ever experienced during my age of 22 Finished half that story before never going back to it after my manic episode had ended Now I am here writing about it and wondering if the same can happen again in the process of this work It feels extremely cliché I would write a novel about struggles with heroin addiction It has been done many times Its just lame of me I feel like my thoughts are bit off I left the hotel the next morning with the little money I did have on a debit card Turns out the woman was from Taiyuan It is a city in the northern part of China in the province of Shanxicoal country with the worst air pollution in China She has a colleague in Taiyuan that takes courses at an English training center I was able to contact this place in the morning via a shared contact on WeChat given to me by the stranger I met that night Before I knew it I was sending my information and documents in my backpack at an internet café in a faxwith the intent that the woman agreed to share my information to the training center as she shared my contact to its hiring manager It would land me a job that day that would help me out of my situation Things turned not quite out as I expected though I was shifted like a ball to somebody else to contact for a training center geared to teaching children I took what I had and ran off to a train station after taking the public transit Unfortunately I was shit for money and could not afford a high speed rail pass The slow train would take thirtytwo hours to get to my destination I would have taken a room with a bed but all I could afford was a hard seat for the travel Things were getting better for me in the circumstance considering I had found someone willing to take me for work despite my visa situation The thirtytwo hour train ride was horrendous in some ways but mostly I was in excitement despite the circumstances Im always giddy when disappointed I moved up and down the aisle of the train I could not speak mandarin but it did not stop me from trying to interact with everyone I talked many ears off during the train ride I went up and down the aisle trying to interact as a moth to porchlightsI could not stop even if I had wanted to I found great enjoyment the times I did get to sit across a table from somebody my age heading to Taiyuan from Chongqing They were a university student returning to their hometown Another passenger who sat beside me was an elderly man with hard boiled eggs he was eating one after another one I highly enjoyed each and every conversation that I had It was like my head was a lightbulb wanting June bugs to bang against it with the intensity of Roman candles shot at my mouth of nicotine tinged teeth If you find someone in Shanxi it is practice to pay the family money before you can get married You would also have to already own a home and a car told my new friend across in their seat from mea university passenger friend named David Not necessarily what I was looking for When is the next stop for snacks When the train stops I am able to get out and to have a walk onto the platform to buy various goods from the vendors to take back with me to eat along the ride to Taiyuan I had all my important documents tucked in my bag This included my health clearance and obviously I made no mention of my mental health diagnosis or history to the doctor who had to evaluate me My diploma and TEFL certificate were tucked away securely A TEFL is a certificate that stands for Teaching English as a Foreign Language it qualifies me to teach English as a second language abroadit had only took a few months of taking a course online that I had paid for to obtain It is easy to be happy when you can trick yourself as your own con artist Mania can make you deceive yourself One can be doused in napalm and still not fully recognize what is actually going on Same goes the flicking of psychosis Even when I have nothing I find myself in my radiating irritation the most qualified of thingsthe velocity of my rhythm sets me out of an orbit The pressure cooker keeps me moving like a propeller at times I finally arrived at Taiyuan I arrived at the station to be greeted by Ryan my manager and his assistant Jennifer We had our hello and introduction and they helped me get to a taxi that would bring me to my new apartment I finally had a residence again Apparently they were desperate for a teacher The last teacher was from New Mexico and apparently they pulled a midnight runthat is when a teacher in the middle of the night disappears onto a plane back home without any notification of it The apartment was okay On the fourth floor with no elevator so it was a bit of a climb up a dark stairwell not lit correctly My job was a training center that had a location near Yingze Park in the center of the city I was to be paid in cash via envelopes I would assist in teaching kindergarten all the way up to high school aged students there in private lessons paid by their parents I would also be assigned by my company to various primary schools in the city I would take public buses to various schools paid by the company I worked for to give English lessons as I bounced around to various classrooms and schools in the city Often I would receive a phone call to avoid going to work that day if my boss got inside input that officials would be doing raids to check foreigners visas that day A taxi ride would always be a thrill Caused me nerves at first but I came to love the flying in dangerous ways along a busy road I remember a driver beeping their horn away as they drove onto the sidewalk to pass people They treated the pedestrians as if they were in the wrong I came flying in front of a primary school at its front gates I was going to start teaching a first grade classroom and a kindergarten classroom The way schools are set up is with a wall around the entirety of the exterior of the school There is a gate at the front where one or two security will be waiting to let people in and out of the complex of the school I walked in front of the gate to greet the security It was my first time with an assignment at this school The guard said they had never seen me before and wouldnt let me in Not a big nuisance while I called my boss who then called the school to sort out the situation I miss the classroom so much I ended up teaching in China for five years at various training schools After returning to Illinois I still taught as a primary school teacher in a public school I often feel extremely ugly from inside to my outside but something is attractive there This does not come just in terms of flirting and relationshipsmania makes me a genuine lightbulb that flickers in a way that encourages the insects to meeveryone looks like a June bugthis is what I have come to understand about life But that ugly does kind of stay like rot in a cavity that leaves a bad taste in the mouth that smells foulhoping nobody catches the smell near meit must tie into my struggles with bulimia over the years The same goes for my years as a teacherin relation to the whole lightbulb phenomenonIm positive it is tied to mania and hypomania The younger students always were fixated on the information I was teaching to them I kept over the years methods taught to me and selftaught that I found extremely effective with younger students when it comes to teaching Everything was physical in learning in terms of intensity and ambition When teaching my first grade classroom I would create flashcards for the vocab we would work on and implement in creating new sentences with We would chant these words together in a way that made me a clown while teaching Students would yell out the word that I presented with intense enthusiasm As I walked by students it was expected that while they yelled out the word they would also physically hit the card Later I would also work on physical gestures and acting out of vocab words and they would follow the actions and phrases with me I would often eventually turn the class into two teams When students got an answer right I would behave comically and full of energyI would give them a high five and pretend they were so strong with it that it hurt my hand in the process with much exaggerationthe students always seemed to never get tired of this act One game I would play involved drawing two stick figures with happy faces on them Each figure would represent one of the teams for the classroom I would draw a hungry alligator under the figures Their faces would also be comical in appearance and full of exaggerations Each figure had a parachute placed over them and four strings attached During the game the students would race to say the word correctly represented on the flashcard or the correct word for the gesture I was making The team that was not the slowest would lose a string on the parachute If a team lost all four strings they would fall to the alligator who would eat them The students found it hilarious with my actions involved in it I would also draw tears and a person praying to represent anticipation and worry of falling down each time they lost a string I had a tooth game too I would draw too large faces for each team The team that could answer the flashcards and gestures the quickest would have a tooth drawn in their mouth The team with the most teeth would win and it would look rather funny as the mouth grew and grew with an abnormal and extreme amount of teeth I often did other physical and interactive games like having students run to the word I showed a card to or gesturedeach word would be attached to a point in the classroom on a wall I know it sounds grandiose but the parents always seemed to think I was great at my job The word vulnerable means so many things to me That word is like the coal to form the generator that makes the guiding energy for the ethics I follow in my lifeI hold very strongly to these values that have developed on how to liveI can express it more later but I greatly attach a kind of Christian value system to it which makes sense considering I was raised in a Lutheran household and always went to church Sunday school and went to my courses and went through my confirmationeveryone is a bit of a mopsome pick up clean water and others dirty or a mix of itwaiting to find the people to drain them voluntarily or involuntarily I was born vulnerable I walk pigeontoed and grew up tripping on my feetI speak with a soft feminine voice Bipolar disorder makes somebody vulnerable There was much vulnerability in being eighteen and hospitalized involuntarily for my first manic episodetied to a stretcher I have almost a sense of us vs themthe vulnerable and those that harm the vulnerabletake advantage of the vulnerableI feel this is a very much Christian in the idea of the unfortunate are more holy than the rest of the bunchchildren are like that in terms of being born into a cruel existencea cruel existence I felt at times in my life and so many domaking sure harm does not come to those in need gives the light of purpose to go bright inside like a Christmas tree in my brainthis light of happiness and warmth I never expected I would fall in love for teaching due to the antidepressant effect provided It would become my career for a decade Some grow up wanting to be a teacher I became one by accident desperation and being saved Sometimes I inflate on selfhate like a helium balloon that needs to be tied to a wrist The vulnerability equation is imprinted on my brain In my early teens I started struggling with bulimia and image I remember when my mother caught me in the act I was not offered help but criticized I was called a girl for my problems and threatened to be taken somewhere to be fixed of my confusion I dont identify as transgender I identify as a man that struggles with bulimia and happens to have feminine qualities I attribute it to circumstances that happened to mea justification for the pain at timesan attack on aspects of bisexuality After a long day of work I did what my young self often did I went clubbing with friends I feel like even if I hide aspects of myself such as being bisexual people can spot it regardless Im extremely secretive about it and not comfortable displaying that vulnerable aspect of myself My friend from England went with me He was about six years my senior Big guy Tall The clubs name was Maoye I always enjoyed the free drinks available to foreignersit was done to attract Chinese clients as the idea was foreigners being there would attract people Amongst the hot and sweltering crowd a man grabbed ahold of me I felt stuck I was taken off guard Pushed and cornered While on me I managed to push him off But it all serves as a reminder of the vulnerability of my life A nail was placed into my handa constant burn and reminder of that vulnerability Part 2 From selfhate I can also be so grandiose I am like a Christmas tree that is lit up Sparklers so pretty that you cannot let go of them even if it burns your fingertips and hurts From heroin to sex you can smother the pain You drain the ocean to fill a void in these times It ties to mania as well That restlessness and irritability is extinguished by the paradox of throwing kerosene to everything burning Im so grandiose to hide my insecurities I mistake my misfortune as a mark of something ugly virtuousthe neon of vulnerability pulsating like a star within me Swelling on a pain Bad habits I want you to judge me and tell me whats wrong with me Give me a verdict Stress a trigger for mania and I was stressed from the incident I had experienced at the club I bloated like a tick to distract from locusts of thoughts that could not shut up with their commotion I had been sleeping around more than before My brain was Christmas tree lights I accelerated on a generatorI made a mixed episode worse Tease a disaster when you are heightened like a blimp Full of hydrogen Hoping to burn up ad rain down like napalm When the pretty candles on the Christmas tree are left untouchednot looked at like a kettle on burner that has been forgottenthe dry neglected tree will into a house fire Ive had four attempts in my life so far When I attempt I dont cry for help I feel too vulnerable Im afraid Hate police and wards Downing pills My past failed attempts made me aware of everything done wrong before The sleeping pills alone might not do what I was looking for at that time I bought an electrical cable This way if it failed I would still be unconscious and choked out by the cordfail safe plan to end my life The words coming out of my mouth slowed down I started getting second thoughts Stuck my face towards the toilet bowl while on my knees Sticking my fingers down my throat Leaving blood vessels bursting in my eyes Went stumbling outside and waved a taxi down and asked to be taken to the local hospital Never expected finding myself checked into a psych ward in a foreign country Nietzsche has a quote in reference to chaos in life and how it is needed to create a starthis reference holds so much value to me Sometimes stars hit together just right to create fate out of the worst of things The ward lead me to meet the woman made of paper She would one day become my wife I would have two daughters with her Forge together as soldiers to face the obstacles in life Someone who would save my life during a future attempt when I was found unconscious from an overdose The smartest and toughest woman I have ever known Someone to build trenches with I liked it when she stuck that needle in me for an IV It must correlate to being a heroin addict The pushing of something in my vein correlates to happiness and purity The woman made out of paper was my nurse in the ward I was stuck in What attracted her to the mess that is me I will never understand fully The woman made out of paper is named Lilu She was one year older than me and one of my nurses at that ward in Taiyuan She was from Zhengzhoua city in the province of Henan that is based in the center of China I am sure as the reader it would be nice to know why I call her the woman made of paper She struggled with her own demons She also deserves much praise for her resilience and brains When she was born she was raised by a family that adopted her and often neglected and abused her growing up Her biological family is distant from her even though she has an identical twinthey felt too poor to take care of her and made the choice that they needed to be less of one child as she also has an older sisterher twin got to stay with that family but she was given up and adopted I am sure this must bother her even if she never will talk about it to anyone in her lifeas she is one to refuse ever discussing emotions and feelings as this is not her personality typeshe is very much a fighter I think most would struggle with wondering why they were the one let go ofit also must hurt her knowing that the family would have a son and keep him Despite all these circumstances she graduated top of her class of four thousand studentsChinese high schools can be quite large serving a large regionthey often serve as boarding schools She was a smart and hardworking student Circumstances never made her stop trying to be the best and moving forward and she never made excuses for herself In university she also did well and got accepted at the most studious and hard to obtain nursing position at the number one hospital in Shanxi I have already ranted and gone on about my affection and feelings tied to heroin Drinking of entire oceans to fill voids Paper is a void It asks for calligraphy to be written on it to make braille This way when fingers run over skin it tells worththe reason for troublesit forms connection through those words of declarationthe whining for why things are the way they arethe filling of a void like a heroin addict needing a curetwo papers come together to write upon one anotheras a paper I am her typoI stand as a falling mess with nerves like tripwire I keep failing and losing my composer while she stands stronger as a declaration that has been written onwhen I was chased I listened to her and joined as one I wish and intend to always serve the woman made out of paper who has saved my life and has always been there for me being so strong despite circumstancesamongst the wind of turmoil in life I follow along her path It was love at first sight for her but not for me I had no interest in dating her at the time I worked across the street of that hospital in an office building for a training center as a part time job I would teach adults English who paid for private lessons near to Yingze park in the center of Taiyuan She signed up for classes for me to teach her and brought me food on almost every other day that she had prepared Eventually we found ourselves coupled fully In a pit I get to burn as paper amongst anothers paper Eternally With a life that will keep reoccurring Part 3 Liu A woman like Change lived on a moon Far away You can refer to me as Liu At the age of 19 I was diagnosed with a severe nerve pain condition It is called trigeminal neuralgia but you can call it TN for ease I was frustrated I had completed a degree in international finances from Chongqing University of Business and Technology The boom of the economy was not the same There was an urge to lay flatto not try as a form of opposition to everything going on in a waning economy in China All are elephants chained for an audience People love to peek and stare as though they are glass doors without hingesto be made feel useless I developed TN at the age of 19 and was now 22 It came as an arrow and quite literally to the face Its a rare nerve pain disorder often considered one of the most painful conditions known The illness involves intense nerve pain throughout the left side of my face It felt like someone was trying to pull all of the teeth on the left side of my face without anesthesia The pain can leave me falling to the floor unable to speak or move while screaming profanities while choked by pain A feeling of a knife to my face over and over again It leaves me in absolute shock Like Roman candles to the face An absolute hindrance The anticipation of not knowing when it will happen again is a nightmare at times The disease is often called the suicide disease apparently up to 26 try to take their lives In a state of panic during one of the nerve attacks I began swallowing any pill near to me I went to the hospital to have my stomach pumped when I was found comatose by my mother I want to be Change and on the moon and away from a world I have had enough of Gossip spread around the workplace that I attempted suicide over an affair with a married man There was too much guilt to return to the workplace COVID did have an impact to the economy I still remember my hometown having dirt and trees piled onto the exits and entrances to the city keep people in their places The work I did find felt beneath me China has what is called the great firewall that keeps something in and out of the countrys networks A VPN was necessary to access American TikTok as it was used as opposed to the Chinese version Feels humiliating the nature of the outcome for meI gave up in many ways like so many Chinese youth For work I would go to a local office building Amongst a long hall would be a room for live stream performers I would entertain with watchers while trying to obtain virtual gifts for actual money I despised itsometimes the conversation could be funny or interesting but it felt hollow I would paint flowers on my face and wear hanfu clothing while doing ASMR I had a mind of sparklers burning until it burnt and stung like waxlike I had the option to stop and cry and those tears stuck as wax and burnt or I soldiered on and grew accustomed to the pain I was an elephant chained The audience watched and interacted with me on the live I was a chained elephant when it was found out about my previous attempt and when the rumors spread Too many thorns in life Nails hitting at the wrong points like an equation for something terrible to eventually happen My favorite dish was Henan noodles I often cooked it with my mom It provides great memories of childhood I hadnt talked to my mother as much as before She moved to a job in Taiyuan Sometimes I would go up to visit her But it was harder as she worked more and more hours Sometimes voids build even when going through extreme nerve pain And with trigeminal neuralgia the pain was so intense that I would freeze and scream in pain It cannot always be hid It made me an elephant tethered Life can be like a pressure like no other Too much stress Makes one feel irritable with a mouth like a sprinkler of napalm when someone is too close Life feels like a lit fire cracker heldin the end it would tear my hand up Things kept building while the other side of my face began to hurt too recently This was rare and not so common My eyesight was becoming blurry too and it seemed I might have multiple sclerosis as the pain was on both side it was not common for my age and the blurry eyesight An appointment was scheduled and I felt terrified to know what was going on and wondered if it was best to not even know my health I walked out of the studio and had a cigarette My boss came out and joined to talk He was concerned about view count and wanted me to do things to increase it that made me feel uncomfortable He made a few comments I found incentive The boss sure liked to criticize and apply pressure He was not impressed with my work and thought I could do something different In China an application is used called WeChat This application has many uses People can display and share moments like a Facebook wall message each other send money video chat and even has a feature to find people near to you who are also looking for people near to them I was to attract people onto dates The idea was they would be lured in and the men would go to a set destination to a planned tea house that served snacks When the men arrived they had no knowledge of the setup the bill would be at an absurd rate and if the men refused to pay larger men would use their size to force them to pay up I was not sure at the time yet if I wanted the job Being worried about ethics and safety It was something I would have to think about My medical expenses were growing and I knew the nerve disease could be expensive to treat with surgery All I had was thoughts while looking at the moon Part 4 Taishen My former roommate in the ward I shared a room with had paranoid schizophrenia I was stuck in the same place due to mania and just had gotten my diagnosis of bipolar disorder I was so pissed being stuck there and felt I had no business being there I found my diagnosis to be an insult to me I was only 18 at the timetaken in on a stretcher Made me feel very vulnerable and irritated My roommate was having delusions related to Christianity and could not stop waking me up in the middle of the night to ask and talk about Jesus Left me beyond frustrated He was drifting from his wife and would go on and on about intending to leave her Felt he was spied and plotted against by her So we were both frustrated with being there The toilets were special They would flush what needed to be flushed but not certain things like pillsit helped to keep people from hiding they were not taking their medications He had tried to flush his wedding ring down the toilet but he did not realized it didnt flush I went to use the restroom later and saw the ring I told him He took it out He found it to be a sign form God that he is to stay with his wife and there was immense happiness in his eyes Tisishen Part Continued I was stuck at my current work at Maoye A mall in the central part of Taiyuan in Shanxi Coal dust central China Frequent dust storms leaving me having to wipe the window sills of dust piles collecting Life felt dry as the airnumb I never know what I want Drifting like paper in a breeze 23 and feeling empty Left the previous English training center I working at teaching adults Company started going bankrupt Boss was an asshole He was originally from Datong near to Inner Mongolia That boss ran the company horribly Was a coward of a boss He would watch the cameras and email complaints on my dress code and not talk to me in person A coward When the company was nosediving I got sent an email in the middle of the day stating my job would be terminated by the end of the month I worked in china as an American In china most jobs are based on contracts between employees and employers I was supposed to continue another seven months with my job The contract was broken when they emailed me saying they could not keep me due to salary Contracts can be broken due to performance but not due to finance issues I had already work for them a year on another contract The law in China states I was due to be paid a year and a half of salary My boss was such a coward to not speak to me in person and email the letter I marched in his office and got told to fuck myself I talked to the labor board at the local government office I was told was told that I that they would have to pay me a year and a half of salary for breaking my contract Those times were rather gray for me Clouds were heavy like gnats flying around the face My girlfriend at the time was a stern nurse The girl made of paper She stayed beside My fortress Put up for adoption by her family in Henan Where her adopted mother would put her hands in scolding hot water for punishment She marched into my bosss office and created a storm He refused to budge A few days later when the labor office contacted him he was willing to keep me for the rest of my contract The labor office said that because my job was offered back I could not be paid if I left my job as it would be my choice at that point Frustrating My wife had her uncles boss contacted from Taiyuan to go into the office She had some influence in the area She threatened to look over various certificates to get the branch in trouble My boss did not budge I decided to just go ahead and leave this English training center for teaching adults I went for a new company that paid more passed in the Moye mall on the other end of the city Now I would be teaching children again like I used Is this all I am A server It makes me think of a time right before I met the woman made of paper Stern from her experiences A fighter I like fighters I met fighters before Reminds me of a story A story I hold deeply to my heart There was a woman named Ming I met her through surfing on WeChat nearby searching for people looking for others nearby Older by a few years Met and became acquainted over messages Christmas tree lights in my head Perched to be exploited Balloon with the air let out Hissing all the time because it whines The inferno in me wants me to burn Because it feels right Christmas trees lit are under pressurethey know if they dry up the whole building will be in flames So you have to be festive when you decorateand avantgarde with who you decorate with Maximalist at heart with pleasure Nomads tend to wander to find a better part of the steppe With a phallus as a Swiss Army Knife Paddling in northern China building a trench 22 year old Midwesterner with psychosis looking for a frigate to save him from the deep end Impulsivity a catalyst for losing everything I dont care if youre married if you have a tunnel you can help me in the trench Two staged rocket Already psychotic Be a Launchpad So I can get even further from earth Ripple through the galaxy like I got a mission Even if its delusional Another N1 Get myself on disconnect in the vacuum Even if I come down Iike napalm I met Ming because I needed her and she needed meeven if she was married I was 23 and without security MY first job that I forgot from my boss Ryan was insane at times Working without a visa for a company was unbearable I felt obligated to my boss at that time he promised he could solve my issue if I worked hard for him And I did He was a bit corrupt too and not the greatest Always offering going to brothels with people to make deals happen including trying with me too I never went I did work hard for him though I wanted to escape my predicament and he knew all the right people to contact to fix my problems if I met my obligations Obligations could mean being asked to go to another training center to work part time and gather their curriculum for my school It felt unstable not knowing when I could get arrested or taken away Made Ming a perfect connection to come across I needed a friend that brought stability She was a radio broadcaster in the city Extremely wealthy She would take me on outings eating delicious cuisine in the city or among weekend trips to interesting places nearby I consider her one of the greatest friends I had Because of her it was getting to meet other connections at outings with friends at KTV and clubs in the city Like rhizomes growing out of a tree Sustainability It led to more rhizomes of connections Something I want to talk more about But I need to move the clock a bit To the start of this ramble I was working in Maoye I was on a legal visa at this time My colleagues were not legal They were often Slavic Russian Ukraine and other Slavic nations We had an office in the building setup on a third floor of a large mal with various classrooms for the foreign teachers to teach in They would generally have a Chinese teaching assistant to help them in the classrooms I taught students from prek age to middle school there In the middle of the setup of the floor layout was a large open office I would sit and plan lessons and grade amongst the Chinese staff and foreign teachers One day I grep of plain clothed officers came into the facility They were checking on teachers on the wrong visas The Russian teachers and others often could not fluently speak English or qualify for the correct visasthey didnt meet the right requirements for work visas and would be on other various kinds of visas They stormed in and I remember my Russian friend hearing the commotion tore his shirt with his logo on it and threw it on the ground in a rush He ran shirtless down a stair well nearby flinging the doors open Fear anger got to fill their class schedule while they are all out hiding Final Taishen I met Change Do you believe in the transplanting of thoughts I do Like pollen My thoughts can transplant and Change can do the same too Mania got me again I wrote a poem when I was younger to express it Feeling bold and exacerbated Maybe I am just high strung Ricocheting off these walls like bumper cars A sparkler burning hot and bright Popping off like roman candles I am not always calm but I am high A kettle left on the burner and forgotten Watch me melt away into my ecstasy Where I dance and scream all in one Ill hit peak when crisis comes I hadnt been sleeping I took a second English teaching job and was seeing attending to seeing different people besides Ming Ming was kind and always took me on nice dinner dates I didnt have to worry about expenses and felt secure I was back on my smartphone looking and fishing for people nearby Change came in as a breeze from Luoyang to meeting a relative in Taiyuan Change was working for a boss in Taiyuan She would go on the WeChat application looking for men nearby Flirt to get them to meet her Like moths in dark they get to the lights Useless as a glass door You can peek through Pigeontoed Drained an ocean to fill insecurities Uncomfortable thoughts ricochet in me Like an ambush Giddy when disappointed I build trenches amongst the tripwires of life City feels like a tsunami Manners like a bloated tick Sipping the veins from any limb around me As a stranger to a moth a porch light pulling Desolate in lost thoughts Nights awake and bunkering in hotels Soft in my voice I hopscotch to handsfalling through like particles of sand With enough friction to set off an atom bomb To radiate right through me and hollow my marrow Amongst open nerves I can feel something so I play with the pain No matter how annoying As particles I transplanted through to her screen as we lay in our separate beds in the city Mania makes me dumb We flattered away Fused as particles Her intent was for me to arrive at a designated location to drink and eat late into the night1100 pm With this given location I would be taken down like an elephant via poachersthat was the intent At the location I was to be given an outrageous bill for the service and if I did not pay a group of big men would use their physical presence to get me to pay When I met her at the given location outside the door I knew the tricks I tested her Asked if she would be willing to eat at another location She thought she would eat me and I thought I would eat her My test was asking her to go to another place at the KTV nearby where I knew somebody that worked therea karaoke locationthe LED lights shining and me and her staring at the direction of them She hesitated and insisted on the location next to us I said I had to gobefore I left to contact if willing in the future to go to the KTV Where a perpetual hydrogen bomb would go off on our fused particles Short story please give feedback FN The Dragon Goddess of Transformation This is my first time posting one of my short stories I would love to get some feedback on what works and what doesnt Isyldra hatched under a canopy of emerald leaves the warmth of the rainforest sun dappling his dull green scales He was a male dragon yet from his earliest memories an inexplicable unease stirred within him As he grew so did the dissonance between his physical form and his inner self The other dragons his brothers and sisters reveled in their shared identity their roughandtumble games of hunting and fighting But Isyldra found solace in the delicate beauty of the rainforest preferring to collect vibrant flowers and listen to the whispers of the wind through the leaves His gentle nature and love for all things beautiful earned him scorn and mockery from his peers their harsh words piercing his heart like poisoned thorns But Kestrel a seafoam green dragon with vibrant pink eyes understood She was a whirlwind of contradictions a harmonious blend of fire and ice Her eyes usually a vibrant pink would occasionally shift to a deep emerald green reflecting her complex nature Kestrel had been Isyldras closest companion since their hatchling days the first to witness the hidden femininity that blossomed beneath his dull green scales She was fiercely protective of Isyldra her claws sharp and her breath hot when danger threatened but beneath her tough exterior lay a heart of gold Kestrel possessed a rare ability to connect with others her infectious laughter and genuine interest drawing creatures of all shapes and sizes into her orbit She made friends with everyone from the smallest insects to the most imposing beasts her open heart and unwavering loyalty forging bonds that transcended species and social barriers Isyldras mother a crystalline dragon named Elara was a breathtaking sight to behold Her scales shimmered with every color imaginable reflecting the light of the sun and moon in a dazzling display Strong yet nurturing tough but fair Elara embodied the perfect balance of power and compassion Her voice a gentle melody held the wisdom of a thousand lifetimes and her presence radiated a warmth that could melt the coldest of hearts She was a fierce protector of her children her crystalline scales shimmering with an intimidating glow when danger threatened but her heart remained a haven of unconditional love and acceptance Elara believed in the power of color to heal and inspire and she dedicated her life to spreading beauty and joy throughout the world Elara had always been a pillar of unconditional love and support She would often soar to the heavens whispering prayers to the stars for the wellbeing and happiness of her hatchlings Her unwavering belief in Isyldras unique spirit had instilled in him a quiet strength empowering him to embrace his true self Determined to discover his true self Isyldra embarked on a solitary journey Kestrel always in his thoughts his mothers love a guiding light in his heart He sought the wisdom of the ancient tree spirit who revealed the secrets of transformation hidden deep within the rainforests heart Isyldra underwent a series of trials each one designed to challenge his perception of self The first trial involved navigating a dense thicket of thorns a physical manifestation of the pain and struggle of shedding societal expectations The sharp barbs tore at Isyldras dull green scales each puncture a searing reminder of the harsh words and mocking laughter that had haunted him for so long Scales once a symbol of strength and protection now crumbled and fell away revealing the tender flesh beneath A wave of nausea washed over Isyldra the vulnerability leaving him exposed and raw He felt a deepseated terror a primal fear of being seen for who he truly was Every instinct screamed at him to retreat to rebuild the walls he had so carefully constructed around his heart But a flicker of defiance sparked within him His mothers unwavering love Kestrels fierce loyalty the tree spirits cryptic guidance they all echoed in his mind urging him forward He took a hesitant step then another his claws sinking into the soft earth drawing strength from the ancient rainforest that had nurtured him since birth With every agonizing step Isyldra felt a weight lifting from his shoulders a burden he hadnt even realized he carried The pain was intense but it was also strangely liberating Each fallen scale was a piece of the past discarded a step closer to the truth of his being And then a miracle As the old scales fell away new ones emerged glistening with an ethereal light They were softer more delicate shimmering with an iridescent sheen that reflected the colors of the rainforest A surge of joy coursed through Isyldra a realization dawning upon him he was not losing himself but rather finding himself The pain was a catalyst for growth a necessary step on his journey towards selfdiscovery The thicket of thorns had become a crucible of transformation forging a stronger truer version of himself The second trial required him to cross a raging river a representation of the emotional turmoil and the fear of the unknown that accompanied his transformation The water a churning mass of white foam and swirling eddies roared with a deafening fury threatening to sweep Isyldra away into its murky depths Each time he plunged into the icy torrent the current tore at his body ripping away more scales The sensation was agonizing both physically and emotionally Fear clawed at his throat the uncertainty of what lay ahead a chilling weight on his heart Every lost scale felt like a piece of himself chipped away leaving him exposed and vulnerable to the relentless judgment of the world Yet as the river stripped him bare it also revealed something extraordinary Beneath the dull green scales a symphony of vibrant hues began to emerge Pinks soft and delicate like the petals of a rainforest orchid swirled and danced alongside bold electrifying blues reminiscent of the sky after a summer storm These colors so long hidden and suppressed burst forth with a radiant energy that filled Isyldra with a newfound sense of wonder and excitement With each surge of the current a wave of terror was followed by a rush of elation He was not simply losing himself he was becoming something new something vibrant and beautiful The fear of the unknown transformed into a thrilling anticipation of the possibilities that lay ahead The final trial led Isyldra to a hidden waterfall a place of selfreflection and acceptance The cascade of water thundered down a symphony of natures raw power As she stood before the crystalclear pool at its base her reflection wavered and danced the waters movement distorting her image But as she gazed deeper as if drawn into a trance by the mesmerizing flow the chaos stilled The water became a placid mirror and her reflection transformed before her very eyes The dull green scales the mask she had worn for so long melted away like morning mist In its place a breathtaking mosaic of vibrant colors bloomed across her body Blue as deep as the twilight sky blended seamlessly into soft blushing pinks and the purest of whites shimmered like starlight Each scale was a masterpiece a testament to the unique beauty that had always resided within her A gasp escaped Isyldras lips her heart thrumming with a heady mix of fear and exhilaration She reached out a trembling hand her fingertips barely grazing the surface of the pool The water rippled again but her reflection remained a majestic dragon goddess her true self revealed Isyldra collapsed to her knees tears streaming down her face no longer tears of pain and selfdoubt but of pure unbridled joy Her inner self so long suppressed and hidden was finally free to soar As the Dragon Goddess of Transformation Isyldra soared through the skies her heart overflowing with a newfound joy and purpose The journey had been arduous filled with pain and doubt but the reward was immeasurable She had discovered her true self shed the shackles of societal expectations and emerged as a radiant beacon of hope for others struggling to find their own path Every shimmering scale on her body served as a testament to her strength resilience and the transformative power of selfacceptance Isyldra and Kestrel traveled together their bond deepened by shared experience and unwavering support They became a symbol of unity and acceptance their differences complementing each other in a dance of vibrant hues The rainforest thrived under Isyldras care its colors intensified its creatures emboldened by her presence The flowers bloomed brighter the rivers flowed stronger and the very air hummed with the energy of transformation Isyldras fame spread far and wide attracting creatures from distant lands seeking her guidance and wisdom She welcomed them with open arms her gentle spirit and unwavering belief in their potential igniting a spark of hope in even the most broken of hearts Under her tutelage they shed their fears and insecurities embracing their true selves with newfound confidence and purpose Isyldras influence extended beyond the rainforest her message of selfacceptance echoing through the mountains valleys and oceans inspiring a wave of transformation that swept across the world A Love Letter to Humanity cw suicide and violence May this letter find you in a spirit of anger My name is Dick Neilson renowned geneticist chairperson of the International Council of Freedom and Prosperity ICFP and soontobe mass murderer I greet you in anguish This letter will serve as my confession my suicide note and my billetdoux to humanity Come what may Shakespeare originally popularized that expression come what may in Macbeth which is a story about what happens when you let fate meddle with everything Hes dead and wont mind my borrowing it I would argue that trusting fate is the metaphysical equivalent of trusting a drunk chimpanzee behind the wheel of a speeding semi in rush hour traffic which is what humanity has been doing for centuries No more We have taken the wheel Part 1 Reality is a bastard and we are its many fathers In 2030 we overshot Earths population limit by several billion This was our core concern at the International Council of Freedom and Prosperity which was affectionately nicknamed The Old White Mans Club by leftleaning journalist Jim Freznik Hes not wrong for we are old and white and men Say what you will Our intentions were pure I digress War famine genocide most of it can be linked back to dwindling resources spread between too many people Like many scientists before us we dabbled And like many scientists before us we irrevocably reshaped humanity in our own image Come what may Ill put it even more bluntly I have stolen from billions of men women and children living in the western hemisphere There I said it The object of my theft the latter half of their natural lifespan Very few of them will live past the age of 45 I am 70 Like so many before me I have lived too long Before you crucify me know this In terms of eugenics I am Robinhood stealing from an opulent piggish era to give to an impoverished future And the outlook was very poor I assure you I could forgive the desecration of life and nature as a result of necessity But I could not and will not forgive its destruction in the glutinous pursuit of prosperity I am not sorry and please let me explain Part 2 The forlorn hope Even when I was born in the year of 1960 the Earth was bursting at the seams with useless people My father Alex Neilson was one of them He worked as an advertising man He never created anything or helped anyone in his life His mission was to tickle an insatiable hunger for material things mirages for people to chase with their money God forgive him because he was damn good at it The American Dream of the 1960s had a white picket fence because my father put it there Men like my father drove the consumerist feeding frenzy that decimated our planet but he didnt do it intentionally He was a natural born storyteller Like all good storytellers he was a romantic and a true believer which ironically made him more susceptible to the hunger than most His mirage was an abstract feeling success manifested in sparkling chrome luxury and speed the Cadillac When were finally rich Im going to take you on a ride to the coast in our brand new Cadillac he would say to my mother laughing and then kissing her on the cheek It was a wonderful dream or so it seemed And then finally on a warm summer day in 1969 he got his wish We went to the dealership to see the Cadillacs To my nine year old eyes they looked the same a blue one here cream with green accent stripes convertible topped to me it didnt matter I did not see the mythos that had enveloped my father I saw only a car Over tireless hours of talking to the salesman we went over each feature in painstaking detail The millimeter thickness of the leather upholstery the pearl inlay on the dashboard knobs trunk size upgrade options and on and on He settled on a cream convertible with green accent fenders and leather upholstery to match I expected him to be overjoyed on the ride home Instead we drove in silence When we arrived home I watched him inspecting the machinery in the driveway running his fingers across the fenders This one isnt quite flush he said bending down to examine it closer Dick come here Do you see that I looked at the fender and then at my father and then back at the fender It looked normal to me and that is what I told him No no Its not quite flush Ill have to call the dealership in the morning and have them work it out Ill never forget the look on his face the inability to reconcile the material object with the myth the mass produced pile of metal with the fantasy It was as if a Cadillac had died and left its Earthly pulp decaying in our driveway I didnt understand it then but here is what I think my father realized in that moment there is no such thing as a Cadillac and there never was The mirage had moved further down the road only the the hunger remained It may have been the hunger Or it may have been my parents crumbling marriage But life would get the better of him as it has a way of doing And when I was only 17 he went out to the garage started his beloved Cadillac and went to sleep He was only 58 PS To my knowledge my parents never did take that ride to the coast Part 3 Corruption of my youth After my father died I took to emptiness and made it a part of me I simplified my room to a single mattress and pillow I got rid of decorations posters comics childrens games I was determined to change the world It was my obligation I stayed away from women and booze and drugs and worked diligently in my text books To this day I have not slept with a woman although I had many opportunities My reasons are no longer concerned with studiousness however It comes down to a more practical matter of resource conservation Human couples consume three times the amount of resources than singles with their pizza date nights Caribbean cruise vacations Costco shopping etc Humans get fat and happy when theyre together Its biology the desire to mate keep the species going and prosper It is our undoing The closest Ive ever gotten to a woman was in college Her name was Julie I was not attracted to her but she was attractive like the way a finger painting or clay mug is attractive Her zeal for genetics nearly equaled my own We met as lab partners where our ideas fed off each other Soon we were frequent partners in study Thats when I first told her about CRISPR a dawning gene editing process of that time Want bigger muscles Just edit the gene Want to change your predisposition to breast cancer Just edit the gene It all seemed so hopeful Of course we know now that editing one gene causes a snowball of faults in others CRISPR was abandoned after UK scientists turned two embryos into cancer soup But in those days it looked promising especially to an young and ambitious geneticists like me and Julie We dug deep and together innovated what I still believe was the first CRISPR delivery system This would be our big break Our ticket to think tanks and world changing projects All we needed was live test subjects and I knew exactly where to find them The University of Ohios anthropology department had several chimps that were being taught sign language Chimp DNA is just a hairs difference from human DNA These I suggested to Julie would be our subjects Our Adams and our Eves I lied to the anthropology department about taking blood samples for genetic analysis to get close to the chimps Wed actually be giving several of them CRISPR injections that would change fur color from brown to blonde One injection and in a few weeks there would be blonde chimps walking around What would they think of that Everything went to plan The sedated chimps stretched before us I handed Julie the syringe with the CRISPR I watched her watching the chimps gently stroking their fur her gaze softening in an almost motherly way It was then that I knew she wouldnt be able to do it She took my syringe of CRISPR and left without a word We didnt speak much after that Last I heard of her she got married like everyone else Had a family like everyone else Doomed the world like everyone else Part 3 You cant make an omelette without breaking a few eggs There is an investigative journalist from Midland Ohio that wont be going home to his family For that I am sorry And although I will eventually be a murderer many times over this reporter was my first and most intentional It couldnt be helped Jim Freznek was a consumer watchdog reporter which ironically put us on the same side Although he didnt see it that way According to his Facebook he had a beautiful wife age 44 and a son age 5a happy family by all appearances He was good at his job His face frequented local news reports about storms traffic jams ribbon cuttings smalltime saltoftheEarth stories He caught his big break when a fracking company moved into Midland and turned the local drinking water into cancerous sludge That was his rocket to an investigative reporting position for CBS His big break the event that set our paths on an inevitable collision course Come what may I imagine he literally jumped out of his seat when he got an email from a whistleblower at our virus research center in Wuhan Of course we knew who the whistleblower was We hired a lackey to audit the movement of specimen inventory He felt lucky to be there and was woefully under qualified That was the whole point We needed things to be loose But we underestimated him He caught on And so he sent the email and sealed Jims fate Its regrettable I didnt plan to kill Jim when he came to my office In fact I planned to tell him everything The damage had already been done The wildly contagious virus had already escaped Wuhan and infected most of the world And my suicide was already top of mind and in motion No real damage could be done Jim would be my chance to explain everything my righteous vessel for sanctification When he walked into my office he carried the air of a man who already knew all the answers How wrong he was I denied nothing and then I expounded His face grew pale and flat as I explained how wed engineered a virus to compromise DNA How wed let it spread to billions of men women and children How it caused a fatal mutation in heart tissue at the age of 45 But I also explained our situation how the Earths soil was going barren from industrialized farming That glaciers would be gone by 2100 That wars violence and super storms would only get worse as temperatures became unbearable He sat there for a long time stoic It was a lot to take in Im sure And then he leaned forward and said My wife just got over the virus and she turns 45 next week I expected outrage I expected self righteous judgement I did not expect him to jump across the desk and place his hands around my neck which is what he did I tried to relax into the consequences of my sin honestly I did Jims hands squeezed My heart palpitated into my neck Every vessel of my blood fought for oxygen This was it the valley of the shadow of death I was ready but my biology was not I gripped deep into the carpet for resolve Then I felt the handle of a stray letter opener and in an instant I had driven the blade deep into Jims neck I hadnt done it consciously of course A survival instinct had taken control once again betrayed by biology I watched in horror as Jim went still on my office rug My chance for redemption bled out before my eyes His death will forever be my deepest regret We were on the same side fighting the good fight to stop the pillage of the Earth and its people We had very different ways of going about it His was a long game too long We did not have the time Part 4 An ode to harsh medicine They say suicide is the cowards way out In my case that couldnt be further from the truth Im not a hypocrite thats all I will be among the first to relieve the Earth of my burden bravely walking into uncertain darkness to lighten the load for the hard road ahead Come what may Because of what is being done today there is hope Everyone knows that this is a time for action Weve run out of road and everyone knows it No one wants change to come at their expense but there is no other way That is why Ive done what Ive done Despite what you might think I do not hate humanity On the contrary I love it I love it so much that Im willing to pay the check to preserve it I wish that I could cover the bill on my own After being sentenced to death for corrupting the youth of Athens Socrates one of the greatest thinkers and teachers of all time leaned over to his friend Crito and said Crito we owe a cock to the god Asklepios the greek god of healing Pay it and do not neglect it Then he drank hemlock and died I say to you that we also owe a sacrifice to the god of healing Let us pay it and not neglect it And so now as I drink my own hemlock literally I leave humanity feeling hopeful that our own healing has begun Dick Neilson Seeking Feedback HOME FOR SALE The boxes were gone Along with the people Soon realtors would be coming in eager to sell such a home without telling any of its secrets or tales The house had seen many families come and go This one that just left was on the better side of people to live there The one person hated the mourning dove in the attic The other person disliked how loud the floor boards creaked at night But even all of the flaws and desperately needed repairs didnt make them move It was a new job That job made them move all the way away Never to be seen again Now it will sit unfurnished until the ones arrive Then the home is looking at where the furniture isnt Forgotten Charlie was sitting in her room gazing out the window at the darkening sky The beautiful colours of twilight had become a dull grey like how she felt within She hadnt seen her parents in what seemed days although the clock on the wall seems to indicate only a few hours ago They appeared to be forgetting that Charlie was alive and it hurt more than anything else As she descended into the kitchen her steps were marked by creaking wood which gave way under her feet that were bare Emma her mother stood with her back towards the entrance cooking supper Charlie paused outside the door hoping for acknowledgement from her mother but received none In the lounge Mark sat engrossed in his book unaware of Charlies presence Mom Dad called out Charlie with a tremor in her voice No answer came forth Inside anger boiled and frustration welled up inside her as she marched to the dining table and knocked over a glass sending it crashing onto the floor without even getting attention from them What is wrong with you Why dont you see me She screamed through house walls Yet there was no response at all She was boiling with anger and frustration She went to the dining table and hit it up against a glass that fell on the ground breaking into pieces Her mother jumped turning quickly Mark did you hear that she called out concern in her voice What was it Mark asked looking up from his book I think the glass fell over on its own Emma replied hurrying to the table She knelt down carefully picking up the shards Strange theres no breeze in here Charlie stood frozen watching her mother clean up the mess she had made Emmas face was a mix of confusion and sadness as if she was struggling with something deeper than a broken glass As her mother swept up the last of the shards Charlie felt a chill run down her spine Something was terribly wrong Whats your problem Dont you see me She shouted loudly and her voice reverberated all over the house However there was no response from them Her mother hummed a sad melody as her father proceeded to turn a page in his book without interruption Charlie felt coldness run down her spine something was terribly amiss On that night she hurried back into her room seeking answers In desperation she got out one of her old photograph albums intending to find some solace in happier times While flipping through pages she came across an image which made her heart skip beats It had been a photo of both of them standing by a grave their faces full of grief deepness etched on their faces Her name was engraved on the tombstone Charlotte Charlie Evans The truth hit her like a sledgehammer and she felt the rush of cold air She had died months ago The accidentit was all coming back to her now The car crash on that rainy night the blinding headlights the screeching tires She had been so sure she would make it home safely but she never did Her parents werent neglecting her they simply couldnt see her She was a ghost trapped in a world where she no longer belonged It was frightening and at the same time liberating when she realized what this meant for her life Her face was soaked with tears as the depth of grief in her parents heart and own tragic end unfolded to her Charlie determined to seek reconciliation decided to pay her respects at the grave A silence fell over the night as she trod through dark streets into the cemetery The mists were dense and there was a gentle wind in the trees The parents flowers were already withered on her headstone that stood under an old oak tree Next to the grave she kneeled down and put a hand on the cold rock I am sorry Mommy Daddy She apologized silently Now I know better than I did before I love you so much The first rays of sunrise brought mild heat around Charlies body At that moment she looked up and saw them standing by cemetery entrance holding hands with their faces white but unyielding They were here for her they came back to cry again Emma wiped away tears from her eyes as she placed some new flowers on the grave which sparkled in the morning sunshineWe miss you darlingshe murmuredEvery single day we miss you Charlie felt comforted he felt at ease with the world They stared at each other as she backed away from the TV and watched them silently celebrate their memory She knew that their love for her and conscience would continue to be as strong as the hearts beating This is the finest way to end it thought Charlie as she gazed at her parents one final time before drifting away for good She learned that she was never there alone she wasnt And as she closed her journey towards the light she again said goodbye because she knew that she was a part of all of them and that all of them are a part of her Is this story bullshit I cant tell Butcher it please Green Lines and shit what a fucking trip Round view from up top the yellow circle is all I had I used to break on that table top Bboy did I love the feeling of my back rolling over bright acrylic yellow The color was fixed in my head pulsating in sync with my scapula a waggling left to right How a color fills a part of the body streaks of yellow wrapping my shoulders Streaks that feel like tending to a good itch Yellow abounds Green Lines always gave me the yellow The round shapes and the spin connects the bright with the body Another tactile color beaming Neurons gleam at my central nervous Far from any minds eye any milky sight I never thought they could tweak and calibrate this state It always seemed holy to me superhuman in a way I get blue too The Godly color It appears deep whirling in a playful manner Because why not It appears as a royal tapestry stretching out over walls cerulean and gold Flexing God seems to have an awful flex I revere nevertheless Im a sucker I know right Why should I pay this experience any mind It starts and ends by the push of a button Its a controlled stimuli Thats what it says in all those waivers Instant habituation will apply How am I to appreciate an habituation that is instant considering the very nature of the word implies time I dream I wake I have experienced two places Im at Green Lines thats three Instant habituation thats where I make my third appearance as a sentient being Im here almost every day I take a long stroll down streets that withhold from me their impressions Past sounds that muzzle my ears views that glaze my eyes and smells that are wet Food has lost its taste no shit Walking is what comes natural I couldnt walk long enough to kick this biological programming The connection I have to that place is all I have Crude how a body resets leaving my every day experience to rot Do I even know how to break dance Im walking down Green Lines I see yellow I see Blue Cerulean Where does that leave me Im not confused this is not me being confused How will I wake what is therein what will it show me Why should I care I dont know how to break dance but I do know a deep red when I see it Why should I care I am spat out and good to go again The Birth Death of the Church of Romance It started with musing on my ideal romantic day a warm afternoon spent between cool sheets with a loving partner listening to our favorite records and singing our favorite songs hugging and kissing the day away Whatever came after would be irrelevant because we would still have that moment Then in a flash I realized this to be the focus the inception of the Church of Romance Partners and consenting adults would form our congregation and our holy relics would be a turntable and a pair of speakers The congregation would make offerings of their favorite pressed vinyls and services would proceed as described above preferably in a large open space with dozens of fresh mattresses The more zealous practitioners might imbibe psilocybin and cannabis to more fully experience the Sabbaths grandeur Worshippers would leave feeling refreshed and at peace ready to face the weeks rigors knowing the support of the community would be waiting for them For what could be more universal than love and music But my next thought was of how the Church would be perceived and eventually labeled Drugaddled perverted polygamous fornicators NewAge free love hippies with no real beliefs and no discernible benefit to God or country Then would come the forced disbandings public ostracization and the eventual crushing of the Churchs spirit and self And so the Church of Romance died as it had lived while I was listening to side A of Weezers Teal album Specifically while listening to their cover of Take On Me but ironically not during their cover of Happy Together Please help me find this story It was a short story I read in a Best of 20xx I dont remember the exact date but pre2015 collection Its so memorable and I retell it to people now and again but I cant find it anywhere The name of the story is the name of the fictional Russian nightclub that serves as the setting as well as the legendary gangster who built it Story goes like this Russian gangsters the protagonist is the 2nd in command well call him P The Boss is taking him to a famous exotic nightclub but doesnt know P has saved up a ton of and is planning to leave the game for good with his exotic dancer girlfriend The club is named after another infamous old gangster who upon the clubs grand opening disappeared into it never to be seen again They enter the club into the main ballroom and take a seat at a fancy table before a central stage This level of the club is very posh filled with people of means P knows that every morning before the crowd turns over theres an auction on this stage where the most beautiful dancer presents the crowd with a single pristine red rose Its all show for the high rollers to show off how much money they can throw away but that rose is coveted nonetheless Ps boss introduces P to a suspicious associate and after the formalities P takes his leave to meet up with his girlfriend This is where the story begins to get psychedelic A floor down P meets his girl while shes working and takes a seat at a bar He orders 2 shots of the clubs house vodka also named after the mysterious og gangster who built the place After he takes the shots he finds himself eerily walking alone in a snowy frozen wooded park Suddenly the suspicious associate of his boss comes out of nowhere and attacks him ostensibly on the bosss orders Our P loses this violent fight to the death and as his eyes fade to black he wakes up at the bar again with 2 empty shot glasses in front of him Shaking off the intense dream P leaves the basement floor of the club to find someone he can pay his large sum of to to buy his womans freedom This journey takes him up an elevator this time and past a filthy and grotesquely emaciated janitor As P passes the janitor they lock eyes and in an instant P knows that this man is in fact in the flesh the owner of this club the infamous og himself With a silent and mangled grin the decrepit janitor reaches out a gnarled open hand toward P to receive the money P knows this moment is crucial but he hesitates when his sensibility demands a more formal transaction The moment passes the janitor turns back to his work P is forced to walk on angry and deeply disturbed down the hall to the next room of the club This floor has several rooms of themed masquerade and as P stumbles through them he finds himself talking to people he hasnt seen in ages Some are family and friends while some are old enemies of his After calming down from his encounter with the horrible remnant of the club owner he begins to realize that some of the people hes surrounded by should be dead Hes seen many of them die himself and yet here they are drinking and dancing the night away He flees the scene afraid he will somehow be stuck in that place of shambling walking dead until he feels snowflakes again on his face P is in the snowy park again but this time he knows the game The catandmouse game of death is Ps home territory and after the night hes had he is more than ready for it P stays in the treeline and waits for his assailant to reveal himself Soon enough his bosss new associate walks into the clearing completely unaware of P P sneaks up behind him and attacks this time with vengeful ferocity and the clear upper hand As he watches the light leave his assailants eyes all around him his surroundings dissolve into curtains that raise into the ceiling to the sound of thunderous applause and P finds himself in the main ballroom again center stage He notices his boss still seated at his original table laughing and clapping with a thoroughly entertained smile on his face P silently climbs offstage and sits back down with his boss He is just in time for the rose auction Lo and behold its Ps girlfriend on stage presenting the rose to the audience As she begins to take bids P sits exhausted and feels like this may be the last chance to buy freedom for him and his partner He stands and offers his entire briefcase of savings for the rose and not a single attendee will raise his offer She saunters over to him and says that this is it its over and everything is ready for them to leave in the morning She looks at him emotionless and says he had his chance to pay the owner and he made his choice to keep the money She takes the briefcase presents him with the rose and walks away P sits down again and time passes in a blur until his boss claps him on the shoulder and tells him its time to leave They go outside to the bosss limousine and P is left reflecting that after all that its back to work tomorrow after all Existencial dread Hello as you know

have made the greatest achievements together Now youre on your death bed Ive sat by your side for hours listening to your hoarse breathing We both know it Here it comes Your last breath I slowly lean in and kiss your forehead I whisper in your ear You just lost The Game And your heart flat lines The worst responder ptThe NeverEnding Debt The windshield wipers were on the fastest setting and still could not keep up with the downpour of rain The only thing keeping me straight was the faint shine of the reflective strips bouncing off the headlights Slow down Mikey we cant save lives if you flip this ambulance over into a ditch I got it Phil just relax will ya Find a place to pull over we will just wait for a call to come in Phil said finally pulling rank on me Ok ok you spaz I found a pull off area a mile further down the road and parked We were just outside of New Jersey in Warren County Phil would always request to work all the rural areas he did not like working the city much Let the junkies die in their natural habitat He would say then followed by Why waste ours and the hospitals time when they will just be back out there doing it again I was a new EMT and got assigned to Phil as my paramedic after his last partner quit with no notice He must have been shell shocked from the job since he didnt even come pick up his last check I preferred the outskirts as well so I just nodded my head and did as I was told I cant afford another career changeThe rain started to pelt the vehicle even harder drowning out the sound of the old ambulance engine Phil had his cap down and was trying to sleep I turned on the radio to the Mets game Tune that crap off Phil grumbled Its the World Series you ass I shot back Its the Mets no one cares about the Mets This is a Yankees vehicle only But they are playing the Sox I pleaded Phil lifted his cap looked at me stern and said Turn it off I rolled my eyes and switched the station A muffled Walk this way by Aerosmith and Run DMC started to blare out of the blown ambulance speakers Phil just shot me a dirty look I switched to the next station Papa Dont Preach by Madonna What are you a fifteen yearold girl he said while leaning in to change the station Phil clicked it over to a news station talking about John Gotti and many of his associates that were on trial for racketeering and murder charges The radio Jocky was spouting out names like he was reading from the Godfathers wedding invitation list Gambino Corle Campione Valentino and Maranzano The list just went on Ha those Dago Wops finally got what was coming to them feel like they could run my city Phil said smirking Hey at least they dispose of the bodies so we dont have to deal with them right Phil Phil shot me another dirty look Shut up Mikey Just then we got a call on the radio a fourcar pileup about fifteen minutes away My eyes lit up Can we get this one Phil We wont make it kid let someone else get it He said pulling his hat back over his eyes Its 4 cars we can at least head that way to help Be my guest kid just get us there in one piece I hit the lights and sped off I needed some excitement Riding along with Phil all night tends to make for a dull shift The rain seemed to match my excitement and started to come down even more fierce than before I could feel the gust of wind challenging the speed of the ambulance swinging the back of the vehicle back and forth Slow down kid I looked over to tell Phil to relax when out of the corner of my eye a blue dress with white flowers in the middle of the road caught my eye I slammed on the brakes and jolted the steering wheel left trying to evade the blue sun dress The whole ambulance started to hydroplane followed by a loud thud sound on the side of the square ambulances shell I started to feel some resistance of the vehicle sliding while at the same time the tires tap dancing from being slightly lifted off the ground Finally we came to a complete stop I looked over and Phil was already out of the Rig Oh boy did you fuck up kid Phil belted out with amusement I met him on the other side of the ambulance to see him staring at a mangled body twisted a contorted The left arm was flush behind the upper body where the hand could be seen almost grasping the right shoulder The left shoulder bone was caved in where you would see what they call the broad of the shoulder Friction from the tire marks burned holes in to separate parts of the once skyblue dress The body was barely twitching I was stunned my brain was mush and my heart felt like it was in my stomach Grab the gurney and get me an extra sheet Phil barked I rushed to the back of the disheveled ambulance feeling relieved that Phil was taking the lead I grabbed the gurney and sheets and headed over to see Phil administering something into the womens vein in her arm then quickly putting the syringe back into a small black leather doctors bag What is that Phil I asked Come on lets get her on the gurney he snapped Phil rolled her lifeless body in the sheet as if he was rolling her into an area rug like you see in the movies I went to strap her in until Phil batted my hand away annoyingly Just get her in the back and start driving once loaded up Phil told me to stop if I see any cars on the side of the road About a mile down the road was a Colbert blue Volkswagen bug leaning forward in a ditch with the front end wrapped around a tree I pulled over Phil shouldnt we be calling this in or getting her to the hospital Wont do any good she has expired But she was twitching when we got to her I said with fading hope in my voice Yeah well I administered enough fentanyl to kill the most experienced junkie lets hope you hitting her did the trick so she does not wake up overdosing My eyes got big and I was immediately nauseous and confused at the same time You injected her with fentanyl But Why Do you want to explain what really happened here tonight Phil said half smirking You will be back flipping burgers or pressing license plates in the penitentiary if anyone finds out what you did Phil looked up at me with a stern but also opportunist look in his face You owe me one after tonight kid Phil unveiled the lifeless body from the sheets and laid the shattered body into the front seat of the car How is this going to pass off when her body has all those injuries I said hoping Phil would change his mind Phil looked at me and gave me another one of those smirks again only this one was more sinister before I knew it he grabbed the poor girl by the back of her head and smashed her face through the already cracked now shattered windshield The clear shattered glass started to bleed red before he pulled her back and slammed her face for a second time this time her face sticking to the windshield Her face was held on by every shard of glass penetrating her forehead and cheeks As I watched the blood splatter all over the windshield I could not help but to start vomiting I could hear Phil laughing behind me You ok kid You need me to drive I gathered myself and got back into the ambulance Drive a few miles up and find a new place to pull over and for fucks sake get us there with no bullshit Phil yelled I started down the road driving five under the speed limit You like your current job Mikey Phil said calmly I just nodded Good because you know if you mention this to anyone and I mean anyone that is the end of this and any other future job I was suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of anxiety at the thought of this Not to mention now I am dragged in to this too Thanks kid Phil II didnt mean too she just Oh just cut the sad boy crap it is what it is now Phil interrupted We are partners and partners cover for each other I mean youre not some fucking rat are you I shook my head no Good cause you got a lot to lose in this situation yourself Pull over here Phil said pointing to a dim lit billboard advertising Blairstown diner Whats with the black bag Phil Phil just stared at me for a moment before taking his hat off and running his hand through his sweaty salt and peppered colored hair Well that depends I can tell you but what I tell you has to stay in this ambulance just like what happen here tonight needs to I just nodded again Lets just say it is my way of showing the world and the suffering mercy I was going to ask Phil what he meant by that when the call came over the radio Dispatch 243 We both just looked at each other Dispatch 243 Phil nodded annoyingly signifying me to answer the call Copy this is 243 We got a call for a blue Volkswagen crashed into a tree in your area Bystanders waiting by patients Requesting medical attention for one female patient twenty to twentyfive years old I sat there with my mind paused still looking at Phil Phil on his last nerve with me gestured with his hands for me to proceed with the call Getting my bearings back I said Copy that 243 in route Better get your shit together before we got on scene Act like you been there before without acting like you have been there before Phil said letting out the most genuine laugh I had ever heard him make I glared at him in disgust for a split second before hitting the lights and heading to the mess I made Seeking Feedback It wasnt the stink you knowI get how months out in the field can mess with a fellas cleanliness but the look on his face was like he was fixin to puke as if he was sick or caught a whiff of somethin dead close by Squirters had some clue about what went down that night in Kandahar but I wasnt about to let this joker mess up my chance for a hot shower and a decent meal I sure wish Id listened to the ganner truth be told I aint had a proper night since then All I member of his face these days Some context anything to keep me awake at this point I dropped in shit lake 2006 just fore the surge The name came from the literal pit of human waste left open to the air they dont tell you about it before you get on the 17 and they laugh their ass off when the doors first open Made your eyes water and the smell stayed with you for weeks Once we got used to it we followed suit fuckin wit everyone else who hadnt had the pleasure Came te be a rite of passage whether ye came on a bird or a moose Id been there a month and it was getting stale I couldnt taste anything at chow most days anyway and I spent so much time on circuit in the gun that I dont member much about the pond anymore these days fuck Brass suited me with a terp they thought I knew the lay no one fuckin did always gonna be another flash on the road no matter how many times you been down it Tried to tell em but butters aint got the sense te light a cig much less listen to a grunt Anyway I get this guy named Ali never membered his last name didnt care so many angels dropped cause terps were workin both sides the rifle aint gonna put my trustn one if I get my say but I still get orders and the brig aint away from th smell I hear its gone now but my boots still have the memory in the summer Ali spoke English er his version of it I could understand em if he talked slow and didnt keep is mouth open too long mujs aint heard a mouthwash neither He was posed to introduce us te people that we could link up aint got nothing te do with me and the serpentine stopped every jingle not up te play nice so far so I let em dois job Met up with Hekmat Ali said he was an uncle but all these ganners got some kind of cousin thing going on so it didnt mean nothin Esaid that we was in the birthplace of the Taliban made me kinda warmn that I was being as much a thorn in their ass as they were in ours but Hekmat said Argandab was gonna be quiet the next few nights but he wouldnt say why just said the word dehqan tween the two of them a word Ali didnt translate for us I had been picking up a little Pashto while I was there it meant landowner or farm crew boss I could tell however by the way he said it it didnt mean farmer I could smell a setup a mile away so I thought Ali was gonna rabbit and leave me and my guys into an ambush but intel was intel maybe I could get bagram for the weekend if I found a nest a muqs I wasnt gonna be picky getting off the lake as we was calling it On the gun back to base Ali said we had to wait until morning that were we was going wasnt gonna be safe til then I looked back at my TL Scott and he just shook his head aint no way we was waitin til mornin Scott called back te base saying we was checking something out it was gonna go it with the NOD and we was gonna make sure nothing was coming in from the north we find something the drone could paint it and put some heat on our mujs fore they was ready We got off the horn and Ali looked nervous I asked em what he was afraid of we was in the safest way to travel in the area and we was just lookin but Ali was insistent that we not go north not tonight I was determined more than ever and I aint been wrong yet He said that there were things about his country we just didnt understand that it would be best to wait til mornin I asked him if it was because of the Dehqan His face went pale as I mentioned it he swallowed deep We aint afraid of no farmers Aladdin The six of us in the gun laughed but Ali said nothing He just sat there the fear of the situation beginning to sink in As the sun dipped below the horizon night crept quick over the valley makin them caves stretch longer and deeper til they gulped down all the sand and moondust blanketing the whole area The night dragged on our convoy cuttin through the Afghan dark like a blade through black velvet The moon tucked behind them rugged mountain peaks threw a dim spooky light across the land As we pushed deeper into the north the chill in the air bit harder and you could feel the tension buildin up amongst the boys Ali was about near his breakin point His eyes kept flickin to the shadows that hugged the rocks and gullies along the road Every little sound had him jumpin and that jitteriness was catchin sending ripples of nerves through the whole convoy I was tryin my best to keep steady but Alis scare was infectious The air was so tense felt like you could slice it open with a bayonet I tried to crack the tension hollerin over to him Whats got you jumpin Ali Youd think you just seen a ghost or somethin He shook his head mumbling something about bad omens and cursed lands It was then that a peculiar smell wafted through the air a mix of decay and something wild a scent that didnt belong Damn Ali if youre that scared you couldve just said so instead of lettin one rip I joked forcing a laugh that sounded more hollow than I intended The boys gave a weak chuckle but the laughter didnt last none choked out by the thick air and the quiet understandin that the smell was somethin elsesomethin none of us could pin down My heart missed a beat The scent werent human or animal it was somethin old somethin that whispered of the earth and decay Alis eyes widened and he whispered fiercely It is not me sir It is them The Dehqan The stench got thicker tellin us clear as day we werent alone no more The jokin stopped dead swapped out for the click of safeties comin off and the sound of tight nervous breathin The boys were on edge scannin the dark fingers glued to their triggers senses stretched to the max The convoy slowed down some drivers takin it careful as that heavy scent wrapped around us thick and chokin We was miles from any sorta safety way out in the middle anothing where anythin could be livin but that smellit was tellin us there was somethin out there somethin downright alienI glanced at Ali his face pale in the dim light of the vehicles dashboard Talk to me Ali What are we dealing with He swallowed hard his voice a whisper torn straight from nightmare The Dehqan they guard the night They are the night We should not have come he shrieked pulling at his ears and trying to hide from the deep darkness in the cabin Before I could press him further the radio crackled to life breaking the tension for a moment Top movement up aheadlarge unidentifiable The NOD tracked heat and lowlight features and at the moment it was the only things that illuminated the road the readout was clear somethin was there My eyes shot to Ali as he nodded and covered his head as though that would do anything The ground started shakin just a tad at first like the earth itself was just tossin in its sleep Then them shakes got stronger rhythmic and purposeful sendin a low rumble through the air that you could feel in your bones tellin every man in the convoy somethin huge was movin in the dark just past the beam of our gear As them thuds got nearer my boys clamped down on their weapons bodies all tensed up braced for whatever might come Ali though he looked near bout ready to break apart all them earlier words of his bout things we couldnt understand like them Dehqan echoin in my head Scott was peering through the NOD his voice comin over the radio soft and raspy Contact Big really big His voice just dropped off into that kinda silence that takes over when youre starin down somethin you never imagined youd see Out of the darkness figures began to emergeDehqans titans silhouetted against the night Each of their steps made the earth beneath our boots tremble a slow rhythmic thud echoing through the air like the beat of an ancient drum They stood as tall as trees at least 25 feet at the short end Massive yet with no apparent malice their faces bore a detached curiosity reminiscent of a traveler pondering a line of ants on a trek Night vision counted seven but the dim headlights of our convoy only illuminated two with any clarity These were not men not people as we could have understood them but something else something beyond As they approached a palpable tension filled the air thicker than fog One of them moved by a childlike curiosity reached outa gesture so disarmingly naive Its finger the size of a log gently tapped the side of the lead Humvee The impact was soft yet it sent a shudder through the fourton vehicle Metal groaned under the strain the drivers door buckling inward the windshield spiderwebbing as if struck by a boulder Vasquez was at the wheel the look on his face one of incomprehension as the life was literally crushed out of him Johns and Askew in the back screameda raw primal sound of terror that seemed to startle the giant Reacting as if stung it swatted the Humvee The vehicle was no match it crumbled as though it were made of paper the 50 Cal snapping bending backward with a shriek of tearing metal Then came the silencea suffocating oppressive silence that enveloped us all Inside that twisted metal coffin three lives were extinguished without warning without a chance to fight back We the survivors stood frozen our weapons rendered absurd in our hands our training useless The air was thick with the smell of oil and blood a stench that would stick to our clothes and haunt us forever I looked around at my troops their faces etched with shock and disbelief This was no ordinary horror no simple brutality of war This was a grotesque display of our own fragility a harsh reminder of our insignificance against beings so colossal so alien The notion of retaliation flickered through my mind a brief irrational spark quickly extinguished by reality What were our rifles against such enormity Against such ignorance of our very existence It was futile a tragic farce The Dehqan its face twisting with what seemed like regret didnt understand what it had done It hadnt intended to kill it probably didnt even grasp what death meant to us But that small comfort did little to ease the sting of our loss This moment this horrifying lesson would replay in my mind for the rest of my life It wasnt just outside the normit was beyond the realm of human understanding taught by a being that didnt even realize it was a teacher Alis voice barely a whisper cut through the tense silence They do not see us as threats We are too small too insignificant But their paths are theirs alone we must not block them Like Alis words were gospel the Dehqan kept to their slow roll their huge shapes breezing past our convoy without so much as a sideeye They trooped with a smoothness that didnt match their bulk melting back into the black they came from as quiet as they showed up After the dustup the convoy was dead still everyone silent as the creatures passed Wehad to chew on thfact that their iron and drills wouldnt have meant squat to those massive shadows It was a real gutcheck a slap in the face of our own smallness in a sandbox that hid secrets way older and bigger than any of us couldve figured After that brush with the Dehqan the first light of dawn felt like a bit of a breather but it didnt last none Rolling back into base the silence in the convoy wasnt just quietit was heavy like a thick blanket squashing any attempt at normal jawing The minute we passed the gate the S6 crew was all over us Assignments and classifications officers lined up pokerfaced like the mountains wed just left behind My team spilled what wed seen every last detail but it was like talking to a dang wall They wrote it all down only to bury it deep in the classified files Ali disappeared in the shuffle went down a different hall and I dont even wanna know where hes stuck staring at the ceiling but I know he aint sleepin aint none of us sleeping sound Thanks for the intel Sergeant one of the brass hats drawled voice flat as a pancake But we gotta see this from what it might mean to moralefor your safety and the missions Typical brasssittin on secrets that could blow up in everyones face not givin ahshit who gets hurt Grunts we aint big on secrets we keep em cause were used to brass playing their games and throwing the board when they didnt win but this was another level Knowing about them giants out there who didnt even see us as a blip on their radar it kinda shrinks you Makes you see just how tiny your spot in the big picture really is To them we were less threatening than the dust our trucks kicked up They shipped me off with a fat pension said Id been blown up that my thinker wasnt right no more Same deal for my crewall discharged under every excuse in the book shell shock health snags you name it We tried to talk about what wed seen but all we got were shrugs and more pills and yammering about dehydration or heatstroke All bull I know what I seen and they seen us toonot as threats or even somethin to mull over More like how youd spot a leaf driftin down a creek just passin by here for a sec and then gone That kind of thing sticks with you It changes you knowin theres things out there so big so indifferent Sittin here now years later that night is still as clear as crystal Them giants up in the hills the smell of ancient earth the sound of their stepsa deep echoin thud thats still ringin in my bones Theyre out there walkin paths we cant even start to wrap our heads around keepin secrets that aint meant for us to know No matter how hard the top brass tries to bury it or how many times they say we were just seein things that night under the stars with the Dehqan was the darnedest realest thing Ive ever laid eyes on They didnt just send me packin with a pension they tried to silence a truth too mighty to squeeze into their tidy little records But you cant unsee them faces the eyes the everythin of it all and you cant shake off the feeling of being totally utterly insignificant Not really Not sure if any yall even give this a listen think thiss real but we better hope they just keep seeing us as ants I dont think theres anything we got thatll even shake the shit off their boots much less hurt em The Feather I mean didnt really have a choice He stated staring at Jackie Did you Unblinking Jackie attempted to stare back into his eyes but Wavered Shaken Unsure Small Finally Jackie managed to blurt out a No The man who was speaking him smiled his demeanour remaining coiled ready Exactly The two men sat in a car in the middle of the garbage dump surrounded by mounds and monuments of discard and debris A seemingly inconspicuous place but to Jackie felt like the centre of a black hole With Franks nonsmile right in the centre Pointed right at him like the tip of a sword The weight of what Jackie was being told began to sink in Frank was pressing the weight of his authority onto him with nothing but a word and a look He realised that in this exchange he was the dog and Frank the leash He had been working for Frank for 3 years now and in the London Metropolitan Police Service for 5 Months before this he was Franks star pupil right hand man If Frank wanted a coffee Jackie was the man who got it He started to think about where hed put a foot wrong where hed made a mistake If this was it truly the end Then what was it all for Hed passed on some information to his superiors but nothing solid enough to convict Hed taken this role as his personal project to prove that he stood for Law Order no matter the price If he had to get his hands dirty in the process then dirty hands he shall have Now what did he have to show for it A widow an orphan and a job half done Hey is everything ok Frank asked Jackie snapping him out of his internal spiralling conversation He looked at Jackie with roughly 10 more concern in his face and 20 more in his voice than necessary Yeah yeah of course Replied Jackie obediently Petrified Falling Abyss Obliteration Long as I know you didnt mean it Ah no harm done init Eh Do me a favour and take me home will you said Frank relaxing back into the passenger seat and looking forward his entire demeanour softening as he gazed disinterested out the window Jackie blinked He did his best to not let his immediate total relief show But he was absolutely not believing what he was hearing Take me home did he just hear that right He must have because he was sitting there as if he had just been told the proverbial court case had dropped and he was going to walk free which was alarmingly close to the truth No worries Boss he said coolly and began to drive the car out of the lot They drove quietly for what felt like 10 or so thousand hours At one point Jackie almost spoke but instead elected to turn on the radio Which Frank responded to by changing the station This was nothing out of the ordinary Frank liked to be in control of the radio They drove for a few minutes before Frank finally broke the silence Pull in here I wanna take a piss He said gesturing generally to the side of the road staring directly out the window not looking at Jackie Jackie hesitated Scanned Calculated Scared He pulled in Frank did largely as he said he would do he got out of the car Walked into a brush on the side of the road unzipped himself and took a piss A rather large one at that Jackie found himself noticing As Frank began to walk back to the car Jackie felt a sense of unease a sense of being watched To accurately state it a sense that someone was in the back seat he neglected to check out of anxiety about to shoot him Jackie panicked thought about whether to check out of panic and risk Frank seeing him crack or to calculate whether it was even worth it to check or not If hes dead hes dead He didnt check Frank got back into the car his very large mass weighing the car back down as he sat himself back in it with some effort Jackie also couldnt help but notice You enjoy the show Frank asked staring at Jackie blankly What was all Jackie managed to stammer out Eyeing me up and down like im a fucking tart while ive me lad out Fucks all that about Frank pressured Jackie here Jackie could feel it The slight difference in aggression gave him away it wasnt assertive it was rage he was baiting him Jackie thanked every god he had ever seen or heard of for his police training in that very moment He acted without thinking then his training doing the legwork He laughed Frank hesitated looked at Jackie for a second as Jackie continued to laugh hysterically A few seconds passed with his laughter punctuating the silence Jackie rocking the frame of the car with his shaking Frank abruptly responded by laughing even louder his booming positively jolly tone seeming to rattle the car windows The weight of choice and oblivion leaving the air more and more with every exaggerated Ha Ha Ha coming from Franks chest Jackie was safe he could taste it The relief washed over him You almost had me you old fucker Jackie said slapping Frank twice on the thigh Which wouldnt have been out of the ordinary Im only windin you up son Come on get me back home like a good lad said Frank Jackie started the car again and drove the pleasant route home from the junkyard Taking in the scenery of the small London borough in which they secured their little empire He watched the houses and trees and gardens flick by the drivers window as he drove He couldnt help but feel pride conflicting pride He was just short of admitting to Frank that he was a policeman and that he had been undercover so they could share a laugh that Jackie had gotten one over on the old man He identified within himself that was his familiarity to Frank almost betraying him again Like the time in Glasgow he needed to be more careful of that Jackies thoughts drifted off slightly as he stopped Checking both sides of the intersection before taking off down the alleyway It led down a small road which led again to a large industrial estate that they had sometimes used for merchandise assembly As he waited he began to think of his childhood What would become of his own child Were something to happe Bang Black Glass Cracked Goo Red They never fucking check the back seat do they Dean Fucking oblivious said Frank mildly irritated betraying his own pain He liked Jackie No they dont Guv replied Dean obediently who had been in the back seat up until this point hidden underneath the bottom of the passengerside foot space This space served well for this sort of thing Lots of roads no one around Dean was cleaning blood from his very old very notstylish spectacles Frank threw his head back he couldnt betray his facade really but he liked Jackie Truly and honestly He allowed himself an uncharacteristically long sigh which caught Deans attention Take me home Deano Yes Guv he responded Frank found in that moment two things he was getting old and it embarrassed him Secondly that he preferred Boss to Guv Seeking Feedback The Last Wish A Forgotten Journey A story about an old man and how his most fortunate event becomes the most unfortunate in his life httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrWpTTlgqqxQt9s Dark mansion We had been driving for four hours when we saw the sign for a small hotel and decided to stop It was already dark outside It had been pouring since the very beginning of our trip lightning was cutting the sky we were tired and could hardly see the road so there was no reason to continue our journey We turned from the highway to a country road but the hotel was nowhere to be found We had been driving for a long time along the country road we were exhausted and nearly fought with each other when the frightening silhouette of an old dark mansion suddenly appeared in front of us Is it here What a creepy place I thought it would be a small family hotel I looked anxiously at my husband The mansion looked uninhabited WellIt does look creepy but Im really tired and I need a rest he answered tiredly and we all walked together towards the Victorian house Having opened the massive oak door we felt a stale smell of dampness and dust but it was warm there and the record with music from the late 50s was playing quietly I could also hear the wood crackling in the fireplace but the fireplace itself and the record player were not visible We had been wandering around the hall and looking at old portraits on the walls when I noticed a very old calendar from 1958 I wanted to take a closer look at it but suddenly out of nowhere a man in a tailcoat with a small sloppy bow tie appeared in front of me Afterwards I kept trying to remember his face but I just couldnt He silently directed me to go to the reception desk where my husband and my sister with her husband had been waiting for me for some time Where have you been for so long We are tired and want to get into a warm bed my sister began to get annoyed But just a minute ago we were all looking at the house I was interrupted by the silent receptionist who with a gesture hurried us up to our rooms The whole situation and atmosphere in the mansion gradually gave rise to anxiety in me The receptionist gave us two small rooms on the second floor and quickly left My husband fell asleep as soon as touched the pillow but I couldnt sleep I think he had been watching his tenth dream when I suddenly heard footsteps in the corridor I thought that maybe my sister in the next room couldnt sleep either When I approached the door I was horrified to discover that the door was open although I had closed it and there was no one in the corridor I had hardly convinced myself that it was just wind and at the same moment our window swung open with a loud creak My heart nearly stopped and started beating as if it would burst out of my chest When I found the strength and went to the window I discovered that it was completely calm outside There was no wind no thunderstorm only a dark night a lonely moon and the ominous silhouette of a dead man at the edge of the forest incredibly similar to our receptionist I started screaming and crying from what my husband woke up terribly scared I told him and my sister that this house was cursed and the receptionist was actually a ghost but no one believed me I tried to persuade them to leave this place right away and in the end they agreed When we were leaving the hotel there was no one at the reception the weather had calmed down and dawn was beginning We reached our destination the next day but this story haunted me or rather the fact that everyone still didnt believe in the damned mansion A few days later on our way back during the daytime we decided to look for this mansion one more time but we never found it The Call Part One Follower The day the world plunged into darkness was the day I found my light I can never say that I have lived an authentic life No I hold myself to no such illusion I spent my days to the ungodly hours toiling in my cubicle and squandered my turpid existence in insubstantiality and other means of escape while the planet churned deteriorating in its wayward axis Even in that I dont think myself unique Just another cog in the machine whose purpose I know not Even the memories I have of my childhood all seemed insignificant even false As if I was a frail apparition projecting from the thin and fragile film of an unremarkable past But as the glass of fate ruptured in the great cataclysm deforming our collective imagination of the world and its destiny so did a beacon rise coaxing forth legions of soulless beings such as myself It happened alongside the birthing of the Dragon from the heavens Burning rocks rained down upon civilization shattering lives and orphaning dreams One such form crashed upon my street Fear struck me as it did everyone But from this stone that came from the sky echoed a call that so helplessly entranced me With my hand wounded by a shard I aimed to touch this now seeming monument And as I drew near it glowed with ripples of flames like singed paper on its obsidian surface tracing out glyphs I hardly understood but whose meaning plucked at every fabric of my being The touch was both electric and scorching It cauterized my wound and permeated deep within myself imparting me with a singular purpose But I never had a will of my own and I still did not possess such even as I stepped onto the path the glowing scar on my hand directed me I was being called By whom I did not know To what end my reasoning escaped me Yet I followed venturing through the ruins left by the Wyrms terrible wings and hellish breath Although my travail only proved extremely harsh and deadly my newfound aim allowed me to suffer neither the paralyzing dread that has stricken every heart nor any severe injury that could have otherwise incapacitated me My embattled journey pitted me against countless foes spawned in the dragons arrival But be them monsters or men I cared little what manner of being I had to slay with whichever bladed and blunted weapon I can fashion While humanity wept and cowered hiding away gnashing and grieving I climbed the fallen remnants of modernity like peaks of majestic mountains braving the evils that stalk the skies the land and the waters Only to find you My Master Ascendant youre such a sight to behold Finding you is as liberating even as it binds me for all eternity at your side You the one whose heart the dragon stole The one who swore to bring an end to this tyranny I swear to you my whole life Every talent that I have will be used in the service of your cause Let me suffer a million cuts and a hundred thousand deaths if doing so will bring you a step closer to the fulfillment of all our destiny Ascendant my Master I a pawn among your legion will march with you to the very end A Whole Bean Tempest Miranda dark roast drip Got it Whats your name Mark Mark Paris watched the barista write Bart on the plastic cup and then place it on the counter Slightly annoyed Mark looked around Elsinore Station coffee shop But for the view outside it wouldnt be hard to mistake the place for a small Starbucks back on old Terra Firma Espresso machines spitting out steam like suddenly disturbed pit bulls A small homemade batch of probably tasty pastries under a glass surface A few metal tables sporting metal chairs with blue plastic rectangles for backs three of which were occupied by what looked like super tall college students staring hard into their laptops fat headphones covering most of their heads But then there was the view Instead of an urban intersection with cars waiting for their light to turn Uranus Big pale green Uranus Mark remembered the feelings hed had when he was a kid back in Philadelphia looking up at those tall buildings Or looking down from milehigh ComcastMeta One the head spinning eyes watering vertigo That experience does not prepare you for being face to face with a planet floating in the deep black of space Uranus The butt of all juvenile jokes It was too big to all fit in one viewport When Mark walked right up to the viewport and smashed his face against it he could still only barely make out the right limb of the planet As he watched that limb slowly migrated up the rim of the viewport and for a moment Mark could almost feel himself rotating downward while the planet stayed still But only for a moment The SNEEZE SPIT HISS of an espresso machine brought his attention back to what tall Uranus girl was doing She had already placed the paper filter into the steel funnel and filled it with those sweet semicoarse grounds and was just starting to pour the scalding water Mark watched the thin stream of dark joy snake from the bottom of the cone down into his cup For a few moments Mark could almost convince himself that the drip of coffee followed a straight line instead of the slightly antispinward curved arc that all falling objects followed on a rotating space station And those few moments brought his imagination back to when he first tried the coffee from Miranda Mark are you getting all this Mark wrenched his eyes away from the pale green plastic canister that had arrested his attention and looked at a display of various video feeds and metrics Mark certainly had not been getting this Uh sorry what Mark yelled Windy RogersChan one of the twoman fix team out repairing Guard4 a communications relay satellite at the UranusSun Lagrange 4 point near Uranuss Trojan asteroids Though system communication could still go via the L5 station ATT liked to have full redundancy If Guard5 was also lost it would badly hinder communications among the outer planets The other mechanic Alejandro Cota was waiting patiently looking at Windys headcam with his gloved paw resting on the open door of an access panel Inside were a couple cards that were designed to be replaceable in case of a failure or upgrade One of the cards was clearly missing I know its hard work sitting on your ass up there Mark but I need you to acknowledge that the Ccard is missing and that it was missing when Alex opened the panel said Windy Oh yeah stammered Mark clearly Ccard is gone and was missing before Alex opened the panel Thanks Mark replied Windy Back to work pal Mark considered the issue First the damage was easily repairable since their ship carried a stock of all the regular cards Second more importantly this is now the third L4 job where theyd run into a missing Ccard These things dont fall out on their own Maybe the manufacturer forgot to install it or a previous fix team forgot to replace it But then the laser would fail to stay aligned from the get go A more likely cause was that someone removed it on purpose But wasnt it hard to think clearly about a Solar Systemwide ring of satellite saboteurs when you havent had your coffee yet Mark hadnt had coffee in three Earth days The coffee maker was broken and needed new parts to function Marks team could fix any problem on a laser communication satellite but couldnt fix the coffee maker Mark absolutely thirsted for coffee Especially for some dark roasted Miranda which he had never tasted before yet sat perfectly ground in that pale green canister he was holding with both hands Miranda coffee beans A long growth low field variety On Earth coffee is grown high in the mountains The higher up you can grow it but still remain below freezing the denser the bean Denser beans like those from Ethiopia or Columbia are the sweetest and most acidic And also the most coveted Growers had tried reproducing those conditions in controlled environments on Earth but with mixed results There was something about being high up that produced fantastic beans which included sharp swings in temperature low pest pressures intense light and lower oxygen content but also something else A je ne sais qua that advantaged those Colombian and Ethiopian farmers It may have been that those beans just wanted to get outside the Earths protective geomagnetic field Because oh did the flavor profiles expand once we started growing coffee in space The first offplanet cultivars were grown on the Moon by American colonists The taste may not have been as delicious as the best Ethiopian brew but the profile was so significantly different that Lunar Beans became a bit of a delicacy sought after by terrestrial connoisseurs Today we know that coffee beans respond differently to all growing locations in the Solar System Botanists still dont understand the exact configuration of conditions that produce these novel flavor profiles but it seems that as long as the farmer is skilled at growing the bean the taste is governed by the geometric position of the growing bean relative to the Sun and other celestial bodies The job would take another hour or two to complete as Mark imagined what those beans would become once brewed As Mark tasted the anticipated sweetness of the coffee he fantasized about various brew methods On Earth he could just grab a French press and brew the perfect carafe He could almost see the 175 F water being poured into the dry grounds watching them swirl and dance as the carafe filled Or maybe a cone filter watching the dark soil rise to the top while the pot below filled with the black ichor a pungent odor wafting into his nostrils Hell Mark would use a regular drip coffee maker or even Heaven forbid a percolator at this point Anything Mark heard Windy rattling off some description but he wasnt listening He was staring at that pale green canister Imagining which fruits he would taste after getting hit with that first acidic sweetness Enough The only thing Mark was missing here was gravity There was an old cone drip funnel down in the mess hall which they used while the ship was accelerating between planets Instead of dripping into a mug Mark could use one of the old NASA space cups Colloquially dubbed the pussy cup by some guys in the laser communication mechanics union it had been designed over a hundred years ago to hold coffee while in freefall using the liquids adhesive properties But it did look like a cross between a squids backside a vagina and a rustic teapot Mark snapped the magnetic bottom of the can to the stainless steel console and leaped towards the hatch He passed through three more portals before arriving at the mess hall It was quite sparse on the surface and looked like any other floor But the cabinets held all kinds of food stuffs packaged in varieties of plastic bags tubes and cans Enough to sustain a crew of three for many months in space It also housed supplies like the steel coffee funnel micropore cone filters measuring cups liquid syringes and of course some pussy cups He strung the setup to a big mommy hook clipped it to a strap on his pants and hurried back up to the command deck Once there he carefully arranged everything sitting normal to the forward panel Cup coffee funnel cone filter Then he placed the measuring cup water tube and coffee can lovingly next to the apparatus Finally he programmed the ships computer to run a series of maneuvers that would last ten minutes before returning exactly to the current position Mark got into position finger hovering over the GO button Suddenly remembering his crew out in the harsh black of space he checked their stats and their image in the cameras All good Uh guys dont be alarmed Im going run a test on Banshees side thrusters Should only take about ten minutes In the video feed Mark saw Windy freeze Mark She was staring into the camera now eyes digging deep into Marks conscience What are you doing Its OK wont take long Dont worry Marks finger hit GO At first it was hard to tell anything was happening But then Mark started to feel pressure on his body as he got pressed gently against the front panel The ship had started to tumble end over end slowly gaining rotational speed When Mark felt enough pressure he started to smile and popped open the coffee can The most wonderful symphony of smells burst into the atmosphere Cherry lime lilac oak Mark almost cried as he carefully spooned grounds into the cone filter When the ship got up to speed he began to pump steaming water over the coffee Then Mark started feeling dizzy Mark what the fuck are you doing he heard Windy ask The first drips came down from the funnel They didnt come down straight but in a clear arc splashing onto the panel next to the flesh colored cup Getting dizzier Mark pushed the cup under the stream and continued to fill the funnel with water The dizziness grew quickly and then gave way to nausea Mark sat next to the makeshift coffee setup and tried to be still while adding hot water to the cone The ship was at full spin now Mark could hear his crew yelling angry words through the intercom but he was concentrating so hard on watching the coffee drip down and on holding back puke that he could no longer parse the meaning of the words The stream of coffee bent very strongly in the antispinward direction Mark thought back to the warnings that all rotating space stations had on the way from hub to rim that warned newcomers to move slowly at first or risk sickness Mark always thought it was because of the disorientation animal confusion brought on by the eyes perceiving the odd motion of objects outside the station But now watching the arc of brewed coffee he though of the juices sloshing around in his own head trying their best to follow their freefall geodesic paths as Mark moved up and down turned his head moved his arms around And that only made the nausea worse Finally the coffee neared the top of the pussy cup so Mark stopped adding water He could feel the ship begin to slow its spin and prepared to be weightless again The strong aroma of nutty dark fruits still filled the cabins atmosphere and Marks nostrils but the sensation was no longer pleasant As the ship slowed to a halt coming again to its former rest position Mark reached for the cup He could now make out what Windy and Alex were yelling various descriptions of what violent things they would do to him when they got back in the ship Mark ignored these mundane unpleasantries as much as his pounding ears would allow and brought the object of his toil to his lips And then he barfed Bart The baristas voice jolted Mark out of his imagination out of the past As he grabbed the white cup he mumbled The names MARK Oh sorry said the smiling gawky girl Hey be careful its really hot Sure thanks Mark said with a smile as he turned back to the table he had claimed near that expansive porthole He sat down and popped the plastic lid off the cup and watched the pent up steam waft upwards toward the ceiling vaguely intending to arc antispinward Then he turned his attention back to the coffee Oh Miranda So perfect and so peerless are created Of every creatures best Mark lifted the cup to his nose took a deep breath and let the intoxicating odor fill his soul Then he took a sip Ow Goddamn That coffee sure was hot Mark put the cup on the table and looked back out the window at Uranus Once you burn your tongue thats it You cant unburn it A Weight of Unimaginable Consequence a short story by Outlanders FYI discusses suicide Suicide thankfully is a decision that carries the weight of not only ones life but ones future Strangely enough it isnt an easy choice to make one way or the other Due to the nature of the question those who would contemplate it are almost always leaning a certain way The choice to live is defined by things People places hobbies feelings and above all the possibility for things to improve Suicide would mean leaving everyone one has ever know everything one has ever done and all the things that would happen in the future It would mean leaving a trail of shattered lives following ones departure as countless people agonize over the inevitable thoughts that follow such a tragedy The thoughts of blame of sadness frustration anger powerlessness emptiness A decision of such magnitude it often poses the very same question the victim struggled with to all that were affected Despite all the terrible things that would happen if one chose suicide it does offer a single thing that nothing else in the universe is capable of giving An end No responsibilities no negative emotion nothing Ever again This end to oneself is so horrifyingly alluring The horror of suicide comes from the primal part of oneself that wishes to stay alive no matter what put up against the more intelligent part of oneself The very question suicide poses are ones mind attempting to convince one to die An attempt to make a decision on its own and thus forcing oneself to either fight ones own mind atop the inherent struggle of a situation that would lead to such contemplations or to succumb to the peaceful tranquility of nothing and no one To look up towards ones future or down towards the end one so desperately wishes for Today I choose to look up however there are many harder days ahead of me Ever Since I Was A Little Kid a random short story contains loredump Ever since I was a little kid I struggled to make friends Perhaps its because I look a bit intimidating with the red eyes dark hair and a voice quite deep for someone with a dolllike face Some of the kids wished to have such features as it would make them look mysterious but at the same time they despised others who have them those red eyes and dark hair Perhaps its because I cant fit in with the others sort of Again while most made fun of me for my looks they wish to have at least one or two people cared for me They would do group projects with me and bought vanilla milk from the vending machine outside of school But these same one or two people would move to another school after some time I had never managed to get in contact with them even if one of them would send me a few printed photos of her fluffy rabbits with funny notes at the back before she stopped sending a few years ago and my mailbox had been a bit empty And then I had to deal with some ostracizing and unwanted teasings And no the teachers are even worse When I was a little kid I got straight As and later on got a few Bs to full on Cs Many of them wondered why Id gone so low when I was struggling with life and Im kidding when I say studying is a chore to me Id do little feet taps and sometimes Id get lost in my mind but then its because studying was that boring The urge to get back to my bed and doodle some of the cringiest meme material urgh I just I just I wish I could be a person A person everyone likes Yeah I have a typical sad backstory In short I have no one I guess I have my parents But then my father has passed away and my mother is sick Both of them carry diseases and both of these diseases are genetic Still Im still alive and well but I dont know when I could live up to the life I want to have aaaaaand here we go again Wow thats kind of sad I know right Hey Im going to Nuggets House next week the one across the place where they park the bicycles Thats great Id like to come to but Thats what I was about to ask Sorry I have to take care of my sister Maybe in another time You always say that What else can I do Theres no one to take care of her except me Oh yeah Yeah In the Thicket My first short story a little short but I feel it meets criteria It was Saturdayno a Sundaythat begat my fear The fear of the unexpected the quiet even grotesque truth in the trees I am both happy and disturbedperhaps even disgustedthat I am alive today You see Im a musician one who prefers more sophisticated music But on this day I was just going for a stroll Whenever I hear music I am entranced It has been that way since I was a babe Beware lest you make the same mistake Behind the tree line as the leaves begin to blot out the sun and the woodland creatures begin to peer at you queerly you must be careful Quiet even Perhaps you should heed the advice and never be there at all There was this tune a silly little tune but my ears were in love and my heart was curious Was this a woman Perhaps a soulmate I thought to myself How embarrassed I am to recall I followed this tune the type that makes you want to dance But as I got closer my skin began to crawl the hairs on my neck stood and I began to feel I should turn back But you see I am a man of logic A man of science What ridiculous thing could I be scared of but my own imagination The air was moist and smelled of the berries that grew here The wind blew the leaves in a rhythmic fashion Why its following the tune itself For a moment I thought Yet I shook the feeling again The bushes shook with both wind and the scampering of little creatures of all types A fox crawled from a rabbit hole and scurried into the thicket Even the birds stopped singing to listen to the tune I found myself feeling dizzy certainly due to exhaustion or dehydration I was never good about drinking enough water Thats how I rationalized the spell that had already been placed upon me No I drew closer and my heart tried to run the other way a tug of war for the soul Always listen to your soul for I did not I could see that there was a clearing ahead As I approached my eye caught some toadstools and as I looked around I noticed the fungal friends surrounded me in but a circle I laughed to myself coincidences have always entertained me I continued to the clearing Once I arrived my heart jumped to my throat my eyes watered and dried my blood turned to tar It was against nature the laws that man had set into place It was an abomination I immediately questioned myself the sciences the stars even God There was an atrocity before my eyes and I knew not what to do The dances they made were inhuman but that is due to them being far from human Something familiar yet at this moment alien I knew better than to scream I fought not to faint and the urge to vomit When you see the unknowable the unthinkable things that seem simple in thought until you encounter them in life I stopped myself from doing these ridiculous things as these things I dont want to call them rabbits or hares They are but demons in disguise I told myself It was more comforting to me than the tribe of longeared creatures I saw Yes just demons They danced around a fire playing an instrument made from the flesh of creatures which appeared to me alien though it may have been but an amalgamation Their pipes blew and the fire danced These wouldbe cute rabbits created an instinctual fear within me Flight fight or freeze my adrenaline told me Certainly I was not going to fight and the urge to flee would not come Commanding each individual muscle fiber to move I began to retreat keeping my eyes on the horrific sight Thats when I saw her A woman a human woman being brought toward the fire on a spit They intended to cook her as rotisserie They had rubbed her in oil and coated her in seasoning She wailed She screamed then her eyes caught me I knew that was it HELP ME OH LORD HELP ME JESUS CHRIST DONT LET ME DIE My poor woman I am a weak man All of the creatures these rabbitmen turned to me their eyes void of soul My heart stopped That woman was not my problem I turned to run and run I did directly into two large rabbitmen They began to shush me one beat me with a club over the head Blood trickled over my eyes as I fought to get away One of the goblins tackled me to the ground Herbivores No Carnivorous demons they are I scrambled I bit and twisted You see Im very slippery I wrestled myself free fighting to ignore my concussed head It may have been at this point that I soiled myself They all came at me leaving the woman behind She gnawed her ropes until they broke and looked at me There was sorrow in her eyes maybe a hint of conflicting thoughts but truly she felt she had championed The fiend herself I fought to get away I knew not what to do I would not have made for good food I was not porcine or mutton I kicked and bit and thats when the instrument landed next to me Why it was a woodwind a reed made of beasts teeth I grabbed the instrument and began to play It came naturally to me They all stopped Their soulless eyes staring into mine I continued to play my song a song of fear of passion and to my surprise they began to dance My gut was correct always trust your gut my friends I played a merry tune and the creatures were lost in the sound They danced perhaps saw me as one of them they grabbed each other and twirled and hopped They chittered happily a disgusting language I slowly backed away playing louder as I did so they would not notice Thats when I threw the instrument and ran Oh how I ran I just knew they would catch me I left the clearing stepped through the toadstools and ran I did not stop no I experienced an endurance I knew not possible My feet were faster than my body as I leaned back a bit Finally I was out of the tree line I turned to see I had not been followed When I try to sleep I remember I told myself it was a bad dream a hallucination but the knot on my head and the vomiting told me I was concussed Had I fallen Did I forget Is that what caused the dream No it was real and that terrified me more than the experience itself What is out there What else will mankind never know I sat at my easel for I knew I may forget maybe due to some magic which Id never believed before I painted a piece that many found ridiculous I never told them it was true But I did tell them of a great place to think behind the tree line Seeking Feedback The Man Who Turned Into A Monster There was once a man who turned into a monster It started as a good idea and he convinced himself it was necessary for survival He lived in paradise but didnt see it that way To him the world was merciless and cruel to anyone not properly equipped and prepared He saw himself as weak and vulnerable because he had no protection So to defend himself he looked outward for ways to stay guarded from any potential danger he might encounter He was naked so he needed to be clothed To meet this shortcoming he stripped the palm trees of their leaves so no one would find him exposed He felt powerless so he redirected the waterfall from its original destination to power his machinery for the daily task His ideas worked at first However as the sun kept shining its radiant beauty became vengeance day by day and beat down upon the bare earth It wasnt long until the trees and vegetation dried up without the proper resources After the fish were gone the mammals followed after One day the man could cover himself no longer with the leaves of the trees because they had all withered away He could no longer empower himself without the strength from feeding on his crop and the fowl of the land Looking out into the world he saw it barren from the utopia he knew He finally realized that the only protection he needed was from his mind but the man who turned himself into a monster found out when it was too late Not going to give ending away cause it wont fit but what you think THE WORST RESPONDER The NeverEnding Debt The windshield wipers were on the fastest setting and still could not keep up with the downpour of rain The only thing keeping me straight was the faint shine of the reflective strips bouncing off the headlights Slow down Mikey we cant save lives if you flip this ambulance over into a ditch I got it Phil just relax will ya Find a place to pull over we will just wait for a call to come in Phil said finally pulling rank on me Ok ok you spaz I found a pull off area a mile further down the road and parked We were just outside of New Jersey in Warren County Phil would always request to work all the rural areas he did not like working the city much Let the junkies die in their natural habitat He would say then followed by Why waste ours and the hospitals time when they will just be back out there doing it again I was a new EMT and got assigned to Phil as my paramedic I preferred the outskirts also so I just nodded my head and did as I was told I cant afford another career change The rain started to pelt the vehicle even harder drowning out the sound of the old ambulance engine Phil had his cap down and was trying to sleep I turned on the radio to the Mets game Tune that crap off Phil grumbled Its the World Series you ass I shot back Its the Mets no one cares about the Mets this is a Yankees vehicle only But they are playing the Sox I pleaded Phil lifted his cap looked at me stern and said Turn it off I rolled my eyes and switched the station A muffled Walk this way by Aerosmith and Run DMC started to blare out of the blown ambulance speakers Phil just shot me a dirty look I switched to the next station Papa Dont Preach by Madonna What are you a 15yearold girl he said while leaning in to change the station Phil clicked it over to a news station talking about John Gotti and many of his associates that were on trial for racketeering and murder charges The radio Jocky was spouting out names like he was reading from the Godfathers wedding invitation list Gambino Corle Campione Valentino and Maranzano The list just went on Ha those Dago Wops finally got what was coming to them feel like they could run my city Phil said smirking Hey at least they dispose of the bodies so we dont have to deal with them right Phil Phil shot me another dirty look Shut up Mikey Just then we got a call on the radio a 4 car pile up about 15 minutes away My eyes lit up Can we get this one Phil We wont make it kid let someone else get it He said pulling his hat back over his eyes Its 4 cars we can at least head that way to help Be my guest kid just get us there in one piece I hit the lights and sped off I needed some excitement Riding along with Phil all night tends to make for a dull shift The rain seemed to match my excitement and started to come down even more fierce than before I could feel the gust of wind challenging the speed of the ambulance swinging the back of the vehicle back and forth Slow down kid I looked over to tell Phil to relax when out of the corner of my eye a blue dress with white flowers in the middle of the road caught my eye I slammed on the brakes and jolted the steering wheel left trying to evade the blue sun dress The whole ambulance started to hydroplane followed by a loud thud sound on the side of the square ambulances shell I started to feel some resistance of the vehicle sliding while at the same time the tires tap dancing from being slightly lifted off the ground Finally we came to a complete stop I looked over and Phil was already out of the Rig Oh boy did you fuck up kid Phil belted out with amusement I met him on the other side of the ambulance to see him staring at a mangled body twisted a contorted The left arm was flush behind the upper body where the hand could be seen almost grasping the right shoulder The left shoulder bone was caved in where you would see what they call the broad of the shoulder Friction from the tire marks burned holes in to separate parts of the once skyblue dress The body was barely twitching I was stunned my brain was mush and my heart felt like it was in my stomach Grab the gurney and get me an extra sheet Phil barked I rushed to the back of the disheveled ambulance feeling relieved that Phil was taking the lead I grabbed the gurney and sheets and headed over to see Phil administering something into the womens vein in her arm then quickly putting the syringe back into a small black leather doctors bag What is that Phil I asked come on lets get her on the gurney he snapped Phil rolled her lifeless body in the sheet as if he was rolling her into an area rug like you see in the movies I went to strap her in until Phil batted my hand away annoyingly Just get her in the back and start driving once loaded up Phil told me to stop if I seen any cars on the side of the road About a mile down the road was a Colbert blue Volkswagen bug leaning forward in a ditch with the front end wrapped around a tree I pulled over Phil shouldnt we be calling this in or getting her to the hospital Wont do any good she has expired But she was twitching when we got to her I said with fading hope in my voice Yeah well I administered enough fentanyl to kill the most experienced junkie lets hope you hitting her did the trick so she does not wake up overdosing My eyes got big and I was immediately nauseous and confused at the same time You injected her with fentanyl But Why Do you want to explain what really happened here tonight Phil said half smirking You will be back flipping burgers or pressing license plates in the penitentiary if anyone finds out what you did Phil looked up at me with a stern but also opportunist look in his face You owe me one after tonight kid Phil unveiled the lifeless body from the sheets and laid the shattered body into the front seat of the car How is this going to pass off when her body has all those injuries I said hoping Phil would change his mind Phil looked at me and gave me another one of those smirks again only this one was more sinister before I knew it he grabbed the poor girl by the back of her head and smashed her face through the already cracked now shattered windshield The clear shattered glass started to bleed red before he pulled her back and slammed her face for a second time this time her face sticking to the windshield Her face was held on by every shard of glass penetrating her forehead and cheeks As I watched the blood splatter all over the windshield I could not help but to start vomiting I could hear Phil laughing behind me You ok kid You need me to drive Seeking Feedback Wear the raincoat This is a true story It all happened three jobs two pairs of boots and one apartment ago on a plain Monday morning during the peak of rush hour commute This particular day presented the same sobering challenge to everyone across San Francisco rain feathery light and mulishly stubborn rain Skipping the excuses I disregarded the weather instead of dressing for it My consequence was a soggy half hour bike ride punctuated by red lights and oil slick puddles that left me moody and dripping at the doors of the commuter rail station I had arrived at the starting line of an hourlong train ride soaking wet There is one rapid transit line that connects San Francisco to the mountain of tech jobs waiting south in Silicon Valley Trains leave every 20 minutes during rush hour destined for the same list of weigh points congested with opportunity salaries and promises of building a better future These commuters exercise their laptops like Roy Rogers rode Trigger into rugged American optimism framed with commercial appeal I wouldnt drip and shiver next to one of these respectable architects of the future without first making a punitive attempt to wring myself out But before I wrung I had to dump Ponds had collected in each of my cowboy boots Working a sodden leather boot off a waterlogged sock while standing on one foot in the same condition is about as good as being lame I must have made a pitiful sight under the awning of the 4th and King CalTrain station I harbor confidence in this assessment because above the civil noises of several hundred commuters rattling through a cement and glass hive cut an observation Im having a better day than you It was a mans voice clear and convincing My own stubborn pride smacked a smile on my face and lifted my head up to search the crowd for the source My uncomfortable grin was pleading that the commentary steered more toward laughing with than laughing at I found the author of the comment He guided a cart neatly stacked with empty bottles and crushed cans still worth their refund fee He didnt break stride moving easily through the congestion in the station I would exist as an afterthought of an artifact in his rearview mirror for only another second if that The crowd reshuffled and we were detached The rest of the day wrote nothing to memory It could have been lovely or lucky or more likely sour and soggy Fire hose to my head I couldnt tell you when the rain stopped It might have been that minute or lunchtime or it might have continued until yesterday for all I recall All the good and bad of that day got smeared drowned or eaten by another anxiety older or newer The day was forgotten except for the man and his comment So desperate to keep turning over such few facts I still wonder why his comment stuck Lucid scrutiny dismisses him as the cause of his own memorability sadly I know nothing about him So his permanence in my mind must root in assumptions He tells himself the truth and listens Consider the weather that day he kept himself dry That was more than I did showing up distracted by my own slippery condition Consider his collection of recycling he recognized value in a resource many overlook and dismiss as a nuisance That is an impressive amount of determination and paying attention Consider his comment he must know the damage of a bad day And still he has an enthusiasm for life In some interpretations he had drawn the short straw of life and decided he still wanted to play the whole game He must have hope I wonder what for If I knew his hope would I have turned back for a raincoat I hope he did have a better day than me I hope hes had a better day than me ever since Seeking Feedback EX GIRLFRIENDS PART This is the start of the Exgirlfriends Series Like any other series of events movies or episodes they always have a beginning And now Ive launched it with a girl named E Thats not her real name Its what I dubbed her when I wrote this episode E drove me crazy until I turned 19 It wasnt just because she had piercing eyes which she did or a thick dark skin that seemed impenetrable or a contagious laugh that always drew attention to her She had all those physical qualities and more she attracted anyone like a drone bee to its queen But as my feelings for her intensified they started to cloud my mind with pain and suffering She was quite a catch and I felt compelled to explore the depths of my emotions Looking back now in my early thirties I wish I had known better Perhaps I wouldnt have lingered so long with the insecurities that developed along the way I have to admit to myself I was naive paid the price for it and still wish it wasnt part of my journey or for those that will follow in my footsteps Anyway things seemed promising when I first laid eyes on E I had just repeated a class and the thought of failing was agonizing I didnt have high hopes for anything positive to come from my studies Then she entered the classroom or the stream we had been assigned to I had already settled in silently enduring the shame hoping other students would focus on finding their seats and not on me the unfamiliar face among them Even though E wore a headscarf and her legs were concealed in the long skirts of our school uniform my 16yearold mind saw past the uniforms ugliness The rules of our Muslim school were straightforward but in that moment my hormones overrode my sense of decorum The prevailing notion was that nobody should discover my feelings as long as I kept my mouth shut and my desires concealed Sharing my feelings with my close friend felt like the right thing to do and without hesitation I confided in him He encouraged me to open up and see if there was potential for romance once I took the leap Little did I know once I opened that door it would be difficult to close Seeking Feedback Ohanzee The plane shook so violently that Melody Gardner put her hand on her swollen belly and closed her eyes She felt her husbands arm pull her in close Passengers cursed and yelled out in terror as the plane shook once more shattering their glasses and sent food rolling down the aisles Melody felt tears swell in her eyes and a wave of sickness rushed through her She gripped Austins hand tightly his arm tightened around her They had hit turbulence some fifteen minutes ago with the pilot stating that it would only last a second or two It grew more violent until there were people trying to pick themselves off of the floor because of the sudden downward shift that happened a moment before that launched them from their seats Well be fine it cant last forever Austin said over the wall of noise that now filled the cabin A sudden tilt to the left had the passengers screaming and crying as the plane banked hard and didnt straighten out The wind around the fuselage roared and metal screamed from outside the plane The pilot was saying something over the intercom but no one could make it out Her heart raced and her body became stiff Austin threw himself around her shielding her from carry on bags that were falling from the overhead compartments A suitcase came out and hit the man in front on them and she seen him go limp his arms floating up She squeezed her eyes shut A crack of thunder ripped though the plane and she felt her stomach contract The jet engines whined higher and higher as if they were crying out of fear Mel Mel she heard someone screaming her name She opened her eyes and seen that Austin was shouting at her his eyes wide with panic but she couldnt hear what he was saying The chairs bounced and jerked the lights all flickered for a moment then went off completely and the sound of utter terror filled her ears She looked at her husband whose glasses had been thrown off by the turbulence and leaned up to kiss him He met her halfway and together they held it until the screams ramped up again and the plane began to pull up slightly She didnt move from him and he didnt pull away Some unholy sound that was a mixture of a thunderstorm and the jet engines failing ripped through the air and everything began to shake violently She closed her hands around his and put her mouth to his ear I love you she managed to say before the impact Melody woke to a blinding pain She couldnt open her eyes but she felt herself lying down on the ground She sucked in air and felt the pain stab again She cried out and tried to move her arm but it didnt move Her body was soaked her drenched clothes felt as if they were pushing her down into the ground Her throat was so dry she thought it was bleeding She moved her neck and more pain shot down her spine She peeled open her dry eyes to the sting of seawater that had run down her face She seen a gray beach and now heard the waves pushing in from the sea She blinked and felt the grit of sand next to her eyes Storm clouds rolled overhead and the wind slammed into trees that loomed just beyond her The branches jerked back and forth while their leaves were swept from them and carried away Hot white pain seared through her lower stomach The baby She tried to move but couldnt She tried to raise herself but the pain was too great A sound of an animal came drifting in and terror gripped onto her She felt her feet moving and the feeling in her hand began to return She lifted her left hand to see it bloodstained but she could move her fingers The pain in her stomach roared back to life and she squeezed her eyes shut and let out a terrible scream She couldve swore the forest around her hushed at the sound The wind died down to a soft a breeze as she tried to pull herself up into a sitting position She opened her eyes again and see the edge of the forest was only feet away Shelter She needed shelter Her dark green maternity dress was ripped along the sides and collected sand as she halfcrawled on her back to the forest Her vision swam from the pain and fatigue was now tugging at her Exhaustion was setting in and it was growing dark outside The pain returned and she gritted her teeth in a yelp She groaned as her stomach tightened in a hard ball of flesh and muscle Her breathing became quick and shallow and she fell onto her back An aching pain that started in her lower back began to march up her spine Her auburn hair clung to her face and she tasted seawater She spat out the hair and bit down at the returning contraction A twig snapped in the trees but she couldnt move not with this much pain She kept panting breaths her hands balled into fists in the sand Then it came A pain so great she felt her mind slipping Her stomach knotted one last time and the urge to push came stronger than she had ever felt Tears streamed down her face and she gave everything she had and pushed Melting pain Flesh being pulled apart and ripped Her eyes widened and she couldnt make a sound She couldnt breathe Something large and wet passed between her legs and then a great relief followed Her muscles went limp Her breathing went long and slow Her pain was still very much present but she was so numb now that it hardly mattered Then she heard the cry The cry that her and Austin had looked so forward to for 9 months The cry that sparked some internal instinct inside her that never existed A jolt of energy and determination filled her veins and she pulled herself into a sitting position Her gut muscles protested at the movement but she wasnt stopping She made it up on her elbows when she seen the little boy laying in the sand between her legs mouth open and crying out The little legs kicked in agony and the hands pulled at the air The purple face was contorted in pain and terror The cord attached at the belly of the newborn was pulsing The babys scream came again and she felt a piece of her chest crack So she screamed HELP HELP SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME The cry was pitiful and in vein Her throat burned and the phlegm that had dried to it came loose She choked and spit it out beside her About ten feet from her stood an ape The dark outline of the muscular creature sat impossibly still The fur was drenched in water but the eyes were glued to Melodys She didnt have time for fear or the energy She looked at the ape and noticed something in its eyes that made her stop The apes eyes were utterly black and leathery yet they were soft It was a primal look but a compassionate one as if watching something horrible happen The babys cry sounded again and Melody whipped her head to it She looked around her and found a rock She reached for it and brought it down hard on the cord connecting the two A squirt of blood shot out Another hit Another The cord was ripped apart by the rock and leftover blood poured out in the sand She reached forward once more her whole body overwhelmed with exhaustion and picked up the newborn Its sand covered skin felt milky in her hands as she brought it to her chest She opened her shirt and rested the baby on her breast She lied back defeated and tired Spasms worked their way through her stomach and thighs The aching pain between her legs throbbed with each beat of her heart The realization of everything slowly began to set in The plane Austin The baby and her body The baby cooed on her chest and balled up She looked down at the matted black hair and began to weep For Austin For the baby For herself She sat there for what seemed like a full day The clouds gathered above her thick black and rolling with the high winds of the sky The wind had picked back up and the sun began its descent somewhere behind a great cliff behind her When she could feel the last of her life trickling away she looked over to where the ape had sat It was still there It mightve even moved a little closer she wasnt sure She didnt care She reached out a trembling had to it Its eyes watched her carefully Her hand fell to the sand and she said weakly Please At her voice the ape took a step forward then stopped Its eyes going from her to the baby After a moment it shuffled slowly over to her The beast stopped beside her and scratched itself on the chest It snorted and began to sniff the air Its black mangled hair shifted under its movement She reached out and touched the leather hand of the beast It didnt move She met those soft eyes once more and tapped on its hand Take him Take him Dont let him die was all she could muster before the boundaries of her vision shrank and blurred into complete blackness Seeking

Invasive Ive been working on In very few cases do societies find complete peace War is inevitable Rebellions rise up against tyrants Entire communities starve But for the people of the once lush world Gaia these harsh realities were things of fiction With tribal communities surrounding their cultures around the balance of nature they had found harmony This is the accurate account of how us humans destroyed that delicate balance recorded from the eyes of the natives Let this be a lesson to future generations and may God forgive us for what we have done I pray history will not repeat itself because the next time it happens it may not be an alien world but our own Translated from Cettet written by one of the natives of Gaia Faern It Came From The Stars We saw it streak across the night sky The ball of flames was so large it blocked out our two moons Mur and I were gathering fruit when it happened I suppose I should explain what Mur and I are exactly in case you are not one of the Shalitnat Mothers Children I am Faern a Dastread We are animallike people Our faces are long and elegant with long ears that hang Our bodies are covered in short fur in varying shades of brown tan and gray Many of us have horns or antlers We are tall I suppose compared to the hairless ones that came from the sky and we have long tails unlike them as well Our hands have four digits instead of their five with short claws though rarely do we use themMy fur was is a light brown in shade with a lighter underside and a tan face My head is decorated with small antlers I say decorated because they serve no real use apart from just that Decoration A pretty thing Our devotion to The Mother makes it so we never need to use them Violence is abhorred unless to defend against predators Violence against another Shalitnat or any other being is left to The Mothers judgment But I digress Mur was my dearest friend She was a Khukhed a small nimble creature Khukhed are similar to us I suppose but different as well They are little four legged creatures with large eyes and shorter faces They too have hanging ears and heads decorated with antlers or horns but while our tails are strong prehensile tools theirs are long and thin ending with a tuft of fur They move about with a sort of hoprun motion with their back legs longer than their front I always found it adorable Murs fur was white with black patches her left ear nearly completely enveloped by a spot Her horns curved cutely around her ears and her large eyes were the brightest blue Id ever seen They were always my favorite That color

Shakespeare In fair cosmos where we lay our scene Where Justice League doth venture bold and keen Upon a distant planets tiny shore Their noble quest hath led them evermore Lo Tis a realm where humans small abide No taller than a hand in size they hide Yet in their hearts courage doth brightly shine Though stature small their spirits are divine Twas Batman noble knight did lead the band With Superman the hero of the land Wonder Woman with strength and grace refined And Flash whose speed left foes far behind Upon this planet strange they found themselves A land of wonders as if from faerie shelves But danger lurked in every blade of grass And challenges did swiftly come to pass Perchance a village they did chance upon With houses small like toys neath golden sun The villagers did marvel at their sight For heroes grand had come into their light Yet troubles brewed for in this tiny land An evil tyrant held an iron hand His name was Zargoth cruel and unjust His rule enforced with fear and mistrust The Justice League with valiant hearts aglow Did vow to rid this land of tyrants woe They rallied villagers both young and old To rise against oppression brave and bold But Zargoth with his minions dark and vile Did seek to crush rebellion with a smile His armies marched with spears and shields arrayed To quell the hopes of those who dared to aid In battle fierce the Justice League did stand With courage fierce they fought hand in hand Superman did soar above the fray While Batman led the ground troops in the fray Wonder Woman with lasso bright and true Did bind the enemy their

Love A Day to Remember It had been three years since I had felt any emotions remotely close to this A feeling so deep that its almost impossible to describea feeling that scared me but also excited me the feeling of being wanted It was a dreary Friday afternoon in mid2016 I watched as the clock ticked closer and closer to 200 I was eager to head back from my internship and get to the one thing that managed to bring my emotions back to life I sat anxiously looking at my phone every couple of minutes waiting for the clock to strike 200 Finally 200 came I frantically grabbed my keys and wallet and headed out the door As I walked to my car the dark heavy clouds littered the sky and the smell of rain came over me I felt the cool rain on my face while it peppered my heather grey shirt I picked up my pace and continued to walk to my car I grabbed the soaked handle of my mid2000s coupe opened the door and sat down behind the wheel I put the key in the ignition shifted into gear and pulled out As I drove silently through town memories of past texts started popping into my mind I started to mentally dissect past messages trying to figure out what our relationship was Dismissing the messages and chalking it up to me reading into it I began to reflect on our time together as friends Its hard to describe the feeling Anytime we were together things felt simple we could talk about almost everything and joke about almost everything but the one thing I loved most was how she made me feel physically It was unlike anything I had felt before It was a deep feeling like a boulder was sitting on my chest I felt nervous but at peace Again its hard to describe but a feeling that I have yet to replicate I made it215 I pulled into the parking lot my brakes screeching as I backed into my assigned spot I put the car in park and yanked up the ebrake As I sat watching the droplets of rain race down my windshield a loud dingding echoed from my phone Hoping it wasnt an I dont need a ride or Im taking the bus text I opened my phone The message reads Are you here Not wanting to answer immediately like a desperate loser I waited a couple of minutes before responding Yes let me know when youre on your way out Not a second went by before she responded with a simple Ok The minutes passed as I stared forward waiting for my fellow classmates to erupt from the exit doors Finally I saw the students start pouring out I watched and waited until eventually I saw her emerge from the crowd Laughing while walking with her friend she looked at me in my car and waved with a huge grin on her face I looked back at her smiling as I returned a small wave As she approached my car I felt my heart beating faster and faster She opened the door and climbed into my passenger seat She looked up at me smiling as she said Hey How was your day I started up my car and cautiously backed out of my parking spot We exchanged some casual conversation as I navigated my way through the busy rainy lot As we pulled onto the main road I noticed that something was different Her demeanor seemed more reserved than usual We looked back at one another as we continued our conversation We talked about how after I dropped her off I had to go back to the school to load up for the state championship for our swim team She had just joined the team that year and surprisingly was supposed to be there too However she wasnt able to make it I always liked driving her home through the back roads because it gave us more time to talk laugh and just be together Eventually we made it to her house I slowly pulled up to the curb put the car in park and then looked at her She stared back at me This time there wasnt the silly banter before saying something like Thanks Ill see you on Monday Insert stupid joke This time it was serious That was when I knew This was the moment I had waited for I would finally be able to tell her how I felt But the fear and anxiety of losing her rushed into my mind Silence I couldnt say it We sat for another moment staring into each others eyes listening as the thunder rumbled in the distance and the rain continued to cascade down the windshield Finally we broke our gaze The rain began to lift she reached for the car door the tension in the car was almost unbearable She looked at me opened the door and said OK well have a good time Youre going to do great I wish I could be there with you I wish you could be there too I replied She crawled out of the passenger seat shut the door and then looked back at me with the same gaze as before I returned the look started my car and watched as she disappeared behind her front door She knew Fuck I muttered as I pulled away from her house What now I thought Based on the tension we both felt in the car I knew she felt the same way that I felt about her I continued to drive down the winding road gripping my steering wheel tighter and tighter I kept glancing back at my phone waiting for a text something that would ease my nerves even a simple Thanks for the ride would have sufficed Nothing I slowly pulled into the empty parking lot to load up for state I threw the car into park turned the key off and opened the door to start my trek to the van Right as I grabbed my bag from the back seat and shut my door the rain started pouring out of the dark heavy clouds Trying not to fall I sprinted to the van I swung the trunk open threw my bag in then climbed through the side door and found my way to the back seat I sat waiting for the rest of the team peering out the window watching as the rain continued to drench the ground I couldnt stop thinking about her I couldnt get that moment out of my head Why didnt I say something I thought Why didnt she say anything My mind continued to race with these hypotheticals Finally I saw some of my fellow teammates emerge from the rain My good friend and teammate entered the car we exchanged a Whats up damp from the rain he plumped down into the seat beside me Eventually the rest of the team slowly trickled into the van Once everyone was in we were off Im normally a very talkative guy always trying to make others laugh but I sat silently as the van navigated its way onto the highway My friend well call him T looked at me and could tell something was up He tapped on my shoulder I turned to look at him he said Dude whats going on with you Nothing I replied He responded with I know you man youre never this quiet T knew that I had been texting and giving this girl rides home for about a month now In fact T knew her before I did and was actually the one who introduced us when she joined the team I reluctantly started to brief him on what happened Surprised T laughed and said Are you kidding me You didnt say anything I could tell you were into her Why didnt you tell her how you felt Was it really that obvious I thought I looked back at him and said Yeah uhh I mean I didnt think she felt that way about me but that moment in the car was just different man I could tell she felt it too T responded with Why dont you just text her Its not that easy I dont want to seem desperate I said T scoffed Really he said If what youre saying is true then I doubt shell take it as desperate Ok I said I reached into the pocket of my track pants to retrieve my phone I turned my phone over hoping to see a text Snapchat or something from her I clicked the lock button and the bright display lit up Nothing no new messages Damn it I said under my breath T looked at me and said What Did she say something No I was hoping she would have That would have made things way easier I said with a nervous chuckle Just send something Jesus youre being weird about it said T Ok ok Ill send her something I swiped my finger across my smudged screen to the third page selected my social media folder and opened Snapchat I opened my chat feed to see if I missed anything from her Again nothing I swiped back to the camera lifted my phone and took a picture pointing to the front of the dimly lit van I didnt want to immediately address the moment we had in the car so I sent the picture with some stupid caption joking at the expense of one of my fellow teammates Sent Ok shell see it and respond and then things wont be weird I thought The last thing I wanted was to mess up our friendship by telling her how I felt about her romantically I sighed locked my phone and shoved it back into my pocket Whatd you say said T Oh uhh I just sent her a picture of the car with a caption about how weird our teammate is Really You didnt say anything else You didnt mention the whole thing that happened in the car Annoyed with how much of a coward I was being I responded with a disappointed no As we continued the drive the car grew darker and darker and the rain continued to beat down It had been about 45 minutes since I last sent the Snapchat I didnt receive any notifications so thinking that I must have missed something I unlocked my phone and opened Snapchat only to see that she opened the picture and didnt respond My heart dropped It felt like I had been kicked in the stomach Fuck Fuck Fuck I thought She always responds why didnt she say anything Did I make things weird in the car Everyone knows friends becoming lovers isnt always a good idea and 99 of the time the feelings arent reciprocated and the friendship comes to an abrupt awkward stop I peered back down at my phone closed Snapchat and with a deep sigh of defeat clicked the lock button As I wrestled to get my phone back in my pocket T looked at me and said Anything Nope Nothing I responded I turned away from T and laid my head against the cool window my heavy eyes began to close as I drifted off to sleep DING DING DING DING rang the ajar door I opened my eyes squinting as the warm white lights shined down on my face Were here yelled the coach I lifted my head from the now foggy smudged window Where are we I mumbled to T Were stopping to eat before we head over to take a look at the pool Perfect I groggily replied Rubbing the sleep from my eyes I stretched and yawned feeling the stiffness from the awkward position I had dozed off in I fished my phone from my pocket to see if she had sent anything Again nothing What the hell I thought I feel like things werent that weirdam I overanalyzing this I locked my phone shoving it back into my pocket T stood up from his seat and began to make his way to the side door of the stuffy van I gathered my things and followed stepping out into the damp chilly air The rain had let up leaving behind the lingering scent of wet pavement I looked at T and said She still hasnt said anything Normally she responds within minutes Its been like two hours I exclaimed Dont worry about it said T Maybe shes just sleeping I think its fine Ok yeah this is dumb Im just going to try to forget about it I replied As the last of the team exited the van the side door slammed shut I looked up at the huge buildings towering over the tiny collegethemed restaurant as I walked alongside T entering the restaurant This way please said the hostess as she navigated our team through the loud crowded restaurant She pulled open two huge barn doors revealing a small private room for the team to dine in I meandered through the cramped room squeezing through chairs as I found my seat at the table I picked up the menu from the enormous oak table as I took my seat The room was packed erupting with conversations and laughter Though I was normally not one for being reserved I sat quietly in my seat with thoughts of her still weighing on my mind We ordered got our food and began to eat After stuffing myself with greasy bar food I was ready to get to the pool to take a look around As we sat waiting for the check I felt a buzz come from my pocket I dug my greasecovered hand into my pocket to check my phone It was her A notification from Snapchat She sent a chat I sat silently as I stared blankly at my phone Shit I thought Shes going to mention what happened Not wanting to fuck up my night I dropped my phone back in my pocket We finally left the restaurant to find the van parked on the curb We walked down the wet sidewalk riddled with cracks and puddles I opened the side door to the van and climbed into the back seat I sat down and watched as T plumped down to my left Once the van was all loaded up the coach yelled Alright were off to the pool then were going back to the hotel The door slammed shut the van started up and we were off Not much happened on the road over to the pool as it was only a couple minutes away All I can remember was sitting nervously as the unread chat overtook my mind We get to the pool hop out of the van and approach the entrance As we walked into the building which smelt of chlorine and was riddled with cool white fluorescent lights I turned to T and muttered She responded Alarmed T turned to me and said What When About half an hour ago I said What did it say said T I dont know I havent opened it yet I replied Really Just fucking open it Fine I responded I pulled my phone from my pocket as we walked through the building entering the pool area I reluctantly slid my clammy finger across the unlock button and proceeded to type in my passcode My heart was racing I opened Snapchat and clicked on the message Hey I have something to tell you I sat staring blankly at the screen Shit Shes going to mention it I thought I sat for a second opened the keyboard and replied Sure whats up She promptly opened the text and responded with I know youre busy now but I couldnt stop thinking about earlier I paused my stomach dropping I looked at T my face red he said Are you good Yep I said with a small shake in my voice I glanced back down at my phone to see that she was typing again My heart was pounding out of my chest concerned for what the next message would say I couldnt keep my eyes off the screen I was yearning for the response About a minute passed before she finally crafted a long message that read something along the lines of I know things felt a little weird in the car I have liked you for a while now and in the car it took everything in me to not kiss you I felt like you were feeling the same way but I didnt know I cant stop thinking about the car I dont want to mess up our friendship but I thought I should tell you how I feel Overjoyed and with a smile spread across my face I promptly responded with I wanted to kiss you too Ive been thinking about the car all day Im so glad you felt what I felt I wish I would have done something I really like you and I wish I could have said that in person I was really nervous haha Thats ok she responded I cant wait for you to get back I want to see you right as you get home We continued to exchange thoughts of how we felt about each other It was amazing That was the feeling I felt so happy so relieved and now I felt wantedlike really wanted Euphoria I immediately briefed T on what was said Thats awesome I could tell from when you guys first started hanging out that something would happen I scoffed Well I didnt I never thought Id be able to get a girl as hot as her I said with my high school brain The evening proceeded as I continued to chat with her The messages got better and better each one making me feel stronger about how I felt about her I was ready to get back home The championship meet came to a close and it was finally time to head home We crammed back in the van to make one last stop at the hotel before heading out I promptly walked through the dimly lit midlevel hotel to the elevator and clicked the up button lighting up as I pressed it I walked down the hall held my white key card to the door pulled the handle and entered Since I planned to see her right away I quickly undressed and jumped in the shower The warm water rained down on me as I ran my hands through my hair lathering on shampoo I grabbed the washcloth still damp from the night prior I swiftly washed my body I rinsed off grabbed my towel from the rack and dried off I started getting dressed I knew that we only had about five minutes left so I quickly put on my clothes scooped up my hair product with my finger and ran it through my hair I brushed my teeth and sprayed myself with my cheap cologne I walked out of the bathroom with my hair still damp I rushed to stuff my drawstring backpack with my waddedup clothes and damp swimsuit I briefly checked around the room to ensure I hadnt left anything behind I swung my backpack over my shoulders as I grabbed the cool metal door handle I rushed to the elevator and rode to the bottom floor After exiting the elevator I lightly jogged across the glossy tile floor of the hotel lobby Pushing the revolving door I eagerly walked up to the van and jumped in About time said the swim coach As I was the last one down I shimmed my way to the back of the van and sat down on the light grey cloth seats The coach turned the key pulled out and started our venture back home I reached into my pocket and looked at my phone reading over the messages sent from the night before still dumbfounded by the fact that she felt the same way I felt about her We continued to exchange messages about how excited we were to see each other To make the trip feel shorter I laid my head against the window closed my eyes as I thought about her and dozed off Click click click click the seatbelts clattered I slowly opened my eyes and felt the van jolt forward as the coach shifted it into park This is it I thought I cant wait to see her kiss her feel her I pressed the large red seatbelt button and sprung from my seat I bolted forward pushing and shoving my fellow teammates as I exited the van I gave them all a brief goodbye and started walking to my car I opened Snapchat and sent her a message Where are you I said Im working Im about to go on break Do you want to pick me up I just want to see you she responded Yes I said I can be there in five minutes She responded with a simple I cant wait I drew closer and closer to my car trembling with excitement I swung my door open and climbed in I started the car and began driving Speeding through the suburban roads excited to see her My heart pounded faster and faster as I grew closer and closer to pick her up Finally I arrived at her work I sent her a quick message saying Im pulling up Coming she replied I pulled up to the curb and watched as she exited Though she was dressed head to toe in her work attire she still looked beautiful as always I unlocked my doors as she approached my car She grabbed the handle and pulled the door open She leaned her head in smiling and said Hey Im so happy to see you I returned the smile and said You too Ive been thinking about you all day She jumped into the passenger seat and directed me to park in the corner of the lot I pulled the car into drive and cautiously navigated my way through the parking lot I pulled into a parking spot and shifted the car into park I looked at her she looked back at me with her freckled face and dark brown eyes The aura from the days prior began creeping back into the car She drew me in with her gaze as she reached down and laid her hand on my leg I raised my arm and pushed her jetblack hair from her face I rubbed my thumb against her cheek and said Youre so beautiful Ive been waiting so long for this Me too She whispered We sat for a moment still locked in on each other She began to rub her hand on my leg as I combed my fingers through her hair We grew closer and closer now less than an inch from each other we both gently closed our eyes and drew closer as I felt her soft lips meet mine Fireworks It was an explosion of emotions a rush of warmth and electricity ignited between us It felt amazing The kiss continued for a few minutes before drawing back to look at her Her beautiful eyes looked back into mine as we both smiled We chatted for a bit about how much we meant to each other She pulled me back in for another kiss this time longer She continued to rub my leg as I ran my hand down her back feeling the side of her breast brush against my arm The kiss grew deeper and more passionate as each moment passed Buzz buzz buzz rang her alarm from her pocket forcing us to pull back from one another It was time for her to get back to work We looked at each other once more Still baffled by how beautiful she was I found it hard to break away from her stare Finally I turned my attention back to the matter at hand I stepped on the brake put the car in reverse and began to back out of the spot I continued as I slowly pulled up to the curb Im so glad youre back I cant wait to see you again she said Me too I cant wait I exclaimed We leaned in for one final kiss before she closed my car door and retreated to work walking through the sliding glass doors as she glanced back at me with a huge smile spread across her face Finally I felt wanted loved and complete There are monumental moments in a persons life that stick with them forever This was one of those moments Even though this happened almost a decade ago I still remember it like it was yesterday Unfortunately I lost the original Snapchat messages exchanged between the two of us Sometimes I wish I could read them again just to replicate the indescribable feeling they made me feel that day As for the rest of the story we dated for about four months but like most good things they must come to an end It ended how most high school relationships end I went off to college and she stayed back home We tried to date longdistance but between not being able to see each other and other drama we werent able to make things work In the end I think it was for the best People have to move on but memories like this this vivid this impactful dont come often I do think about her I wonder what she thinks of me now I wonder if she cherishes that day as much as I do Dedicated to her I loved you so much You cross my mind every once in a while sometimes in dreams More recently since Ive been writing this Youll always hold a special place in my heart Thanks for the memories The Car Ride I never felt much comfort in the back seat I always said we should be in the front We can do things ourselves I say But when he speaks we must listen My dress is made of boucle fabric it is an elegant design I think they look at me admiringly The way I share it now makes me feel out of sorts a feeling that I should have expected eventually The dress hugs me tightly now it isnt comforting but I must keep it on I must show off the beautiful fabric it is Chanel after all I think he would be in awe if he saw me now These men and the way they think they can address the nation with words Pitiful You see all it took was showing off my beautiful dress again and like that the whole world watched You see I used to be a support act just a pretty face used for smiling But now well now I am at the front they are listening to me Its just a shame about what happened I never wanted this fabric to get ruined Any opinions on this short story I made The sun had long dipped below the horizon leaving the city shrouded in darkness Detective Angus Adler stood at the edge of the crime scene the flashing lights of police cars painting the street in a bright glow He took a deep breath the familiar smell of blood and asphalt filling his nostrils The victim was lying down on the pavement a young man in his twenties his eyes wide open in a frozen stare His chest was covered in blood a single stab wound visible just below his ribs Angus knelt beside him his gloved hand hovering over the body hesitant to disturb the scene Any witnesses he asked not expecting an answer The officer shook his head Not yet sir But were examining the area Angus nodded his mind already racing through the possibilities Maybe another gangrelated killing or a vendetta that backfired He knew he wouldnt have answers until he had more information As he stood up a chill ran down his spine He felt as if someone was watching him a sensation he had learned to trust over the years He scanned the dark alleyways and empty streets but saw nothing out of the ordinary With a sigh he turned back to the body This was just the beginning of a long night Angus spent hours at the crime scene trying to find anything that could give him a lead He found nothing The killer had left no fingerprints or traces behind Nobody knew the man and nobody was looking for him The only information the police could find was a name James Davis He was the mysterious man who was killed on April 6th 2021 It was night everything was blurry his head was hurting and he couldnt think straight He was in the dark alleyway where James Davis had been found dead It was cold he could feel the fresh breeze brushing his hair when he raised his head to look at the moon He looked down and found himself staring at a bloody knife in his hand a wave of shock and horror washed over him He tried to remember how he had ended up here but his memory was foggy fragmented He could recall bits and pieces a struggle a voice pleading for mercy but it all seemed distant unreal He dropped the knife the clang of metal against the pavement echoing loudly in the silent alley He stumbled backward his heart pounding in his chest There lying on the ground before him was James Daviss lifeless body just as he had found it that night As he looked down he saw his own reflection in a puddle of blood A deep voice echoed in his head You cant escape the truth it will come back for you Angus woke up drenched in sweat his heart pounding in his chest It took him a moment and he realized that he was in his own bed safe He sat up running a hand through his hair as he tried to shake off the lingering sense of dread It felt so real standing in that alleyway Angus shuddered unable to shake a feeling of unease lingering from his dream He looked at the clock on his wall indicating 130 am Detective Angus stepped into the dimly lit bathroom He flicked on the light switch and the harsh brightness flooded the small space For a moment everything seemed normal But then he looked down at his hands They were covered in blood A scream tore from his throat echoing off the tiled walls Angus stumbled backward his mind reeling How could this have happened He felt as if he needed to go back to where this all began He grabbed his coat and headed towards the dark streets of Chicago As he was walking towards the alley where James Davis took his last breath he felt as if someone was watching him The same feeling he had on that previous night As Angus arrived he smelled something off the smell of fresh blood everywhere He rushed towards the crime scene worried about what he would find Something worse than anything he could have imagined In bright bloody writing the walls of the alley were painted with the same words everywhere YOU will pay for YOUR sins A little story about love being found in odd places And how long distance can make you see things differently Its a little funny I think when I pause to consider just how deeply sentiment has found a way to seep beneath my skin As if it were an ever staining ink that bleeds right into my veins and becomes a part of my dna Today its all about a bottle of Advil How silly is that Who else would clutch a bottle of simple pills in their hand and feel their heart flutter at the thought of those hands those hands I love above all others opened this bottle Those hands have a history imprinted into this plastic and paper label Muscle memory was formed upon the white smooth surface along the carved in divots allowing for just enough tension to be formed to easily open the bottle The pills within this granted you relief they brought an end or dullness at least to something I wish I could whisk away So I am thankful to it just as I wrap my own hands around the polymers exterior and imagine the history formed upon it To me it is like brushing finger tips with past you with the person I have loved for so long It is a simple bottle yes but in the remove of our circumstances it becomes an item so sacred one would imagine it brought from a bejeweled tomb or some other archeological marvel This simple bottle will likely never see this kind of admiration again I wonder on that as I place it down getting down low so I can eye it off face to face Perhaps my love for this object is not folly at all instead it is a fools errand to live with ignorance towards such things as so many others do For finding meaning in such an item brings no harm to anyone The bottle continues to function as it should and my heart feels afloat each time I reach for it A world built with ever more love cannot be a worse off place The oldest Fae in the book Silence befell the woods as the thick fog began to form Geoffrey noticed as the cover obscuring the view to the hiking path ahead thats weird In the middle of may Before he could give much thought to the matter an elderly lady all but materialized from the brush on the side of the path ahead GEOFF What the heck the old lady was using a branch as a cane and her wild hair was peppered by twigs and leaves Lady are you alright He reached for her The elderly figure recoiled with a frown LILY Ah finally the forest allowed my entrapment spell Morning Lily Sprout was happy it had been so long since she was one with nature Now the Iron blood wont run even if he wants to She waited for the fog to stop the man and made her entrance What the heck the human said Crude humans He motioned towards her and she instinctively shuddered the iron touch Keep your hands from me GEOFF Keep your hands from me the elderly lady said I am sorry lady what is your name Immediately retracted himself of course she was afraid I am the lady of this forest keeper of these woods eldest fae from the Southern realms Fae Poor thing must be dehydrated Hi I am Geoff what are you doing in these Woods I AM these woods Geoff the woman boasted I am one with the nature here Oh shit maybe she is some hippie cult leader I see lady do you need help I have clean water in this canteen Do you

cunning as the eldest of the fae Oh young geouf my boy you are the first of your people I have met with such a dark complexion tell me from which tribe do you fare GEOFF Tribe People Is this old fart

almost nothing your human heart can desire is beyond my magic she continued But theres a price to be paid geuf of somewhere her voice lowered to a whisper GEOFF Either that lady is definitively and completely out of her mind or I am being punked pretty hard Does she think she really is a fairy and can go around geniing herself out in the woods I was not one to contradict crazy people especially not crazy people holding a piece of wood in the middle of the forest She was old but I rather not have to fight a crazy old woman and explain that to the police Ok lady whats the price I need to pay for you to give me any wish I want without holding a smirk YOUR FIRSTBORN CHILD WHAT IN THE EVERLIVING HECK Thats it that woman must be on drugs I just met the weirdest crack whre in the country If

wretched human dont touch me I want your FIRST child Stop playing the fool here Yes let us make my first child lady of the forest You have no children But you are a grown man Are you bare or an eunuch THATS IT YOUR CRAZY OLD LADY I AM LEAVING YOU HERE TO ROT he shouted You insult my race and now my manhood I am fully capable of having relations and children unlike yourself Geoff retorted The faes eyes widened HaHaHa the human have yet to realize his mistake he already accepted my agreement his first born would be mine no matter what I needed not heed his preposterous conditions GEOFF Hahaha it matters little human you already agreed to my request no conditions your wretched mind or dirty mouth put forth have any effect The insane old lady cackled spitting the sentence with sudden hatred I did no you old skunk what are you talking about Geoff spit with anger OH but you did you see for a Fae any words of agreement are final magically final now spit it out what is the power that your feeble human mind desires Lady you are insane kuku a wackjob havent anyone told you You cant give me powers And if I dont help you you are going to die in this woods Geoff said angrily Here try me I want to make lightning come out of my fingers and dick bestow me the power of dick force lightning Geoff motioned at his crotch The woman got upright with two hands on her branch cane closed her eyes and murmured something then after an instant said It is done Geouf of somewhere the elements have bestowed your wish you now have the power of dick force lightning LILY Such a human request Crude and disgusting Still elemental magic had to be respected I gathered my strength and spoke to the air to the clouds and the earth their voice was faint here closer to the human realm but eventually they answered I focused on the mans request and imbued his spirit with his desire Its done the elements have bestowed your wish you now have the power of dick force lightning The tall large man looked at me incredulously maybe it dawned on him his tricks wont work he is now powerless before me I have him if not now in the future Now human go on live your life and I will get my prize once the time comes My God there is really no arguing your insanity Theres no magick you are not aFae nor a Geni Ill prove it too you and then well leave this woods to get to a doctor GEOFF Ill prove it too you and then youll leave this wood to get to a doctor my temper lost long ago Look I will use my powers With that I made my best Palpatine impression towards the crazy hag Insanity ensued Lightning shot out of my hands and dick My best hiking pants now burned on the groin area and the old lady disappeared in a distracting puff of smoke with a Kabum of lightning My mind raced for a split second and focused on the area where the old woman was a second ago Trying to make sense of what just happened the only thing through my brain was I just murdered that lady a thought that lasted about 3 seconds before the woman appeared unscathed behind the smoke screen YOU FILTHY IGNORANT HUMAN YOU DARE TRY TO STRIKE ME DOWN AND WITH MY OWN MAGIC she was alive and faes existed Uh How I asked ignoring her lashing out its Impossible I mustve gone insane Its quite real and you will suffer for what you did here but not today if anything TODAY I have to praise you well played Alas I lady of this forest am much more patient than any human and will wait your human urges to bear fruit Then then YOU WILL KNOW SUFFERING Now begone With that the fae faded in the fog and the fog dispersed leaving me stunned and my crotch singed ON A LAND BEYOND THE FOG The old fae walked out of the woods with a smug look on her face Aunt lily Where have you been You left mom worried sick The younger faery said with obvious relief An old fae cant walk the woods of her youth anymore DONT dont give me that crap mom a male fae said behind her you cast a concealment spell on yourself and went out towards the ancient

dripping from her words Mother dont dare Uncle rush the young fae interrupted What willow Auntie wheres the child Willow asked meekly WHAT YOU DID TO THE CHILD MOTHER rushes eyes darkened he was almost fighting back tears Oh you pansies there is no child Lily stated bluntly YOU KILLED THEM No what good is a dead hostage Then what The child doesnt exist Huh The two younger fae expressed confusion in unison My captured human was a bachelor he had no children So was he an eunuch Rush replied Apparently not the old Fae reminded how the dick lightning worked well no matter soon enough all humans fall for the sins of the flesh and when he does When he does youll be nowhere near that man and ANY human child Understand Rush said obvious relief on his voice 33 YEARS IN THE FUTURE so fairies do exist uncle G The little girl said wide eyed at her uncles story Indeed They do Daisie Geoffrey now in his old age smiled at his grandniece Do you remember uncle Rush and Daisy from

us an I am not about to have this conversation with you Alright uncle she blushed and motioned to leave but stopped Uncle do you still have your powers She asked eagerly Not anymore darling now go bother uncle Miguel in the yard Learn to swim or youll drown Tw Murder blood slight horror As they escaped the cursed house one by one they began to look around at those who survived Only then as they counted the survivors did they see Clara clutching her side They watched as the blood dripped down her legs paralyzed by fear and unable to help She looked up and smiled at them as if it was a last goodbye As she opened her mouth her eyes began to shut Her lifeless body fell to the ground surrounded by a pool of her own blood The group members stared at her for what felt like an eternity before realizing what had happened She was the only one smart enough to escape the one who sacrificed everything though she had the most to lose She was now lifeless bloody and surrounded by people she only knew for a few hours though it felt like their whole lives But they knew the unfortunate truth The fact that they would have to leave her behind Knowing that she sacrificed everything while the remaining survivors wouldnt sacrifice anything for her They walked away looking back every so often as her body became colder They covered their ears as they could hear the screams from those left behind in the house Forever burdened by the guilt of those who were left behind and unable to be helped We have to go back cried Ezekiel For what So we can end up like Clara argued Rachel As the words left her mouth only then did she realize what she said The group looked at her as their faces became disgusted Wait I didnt mean it like that Rachel tried to reason If we go back we are for sure dead Their screams are nothing but a sirens call We have to save ourselves We made it this far The survivors faces turned to disappointment I would rather die knowing I tried to help than live with the guilt of what we did Jackson said harshly You cant be serious Its a death wish Its not our fault theyre incompetent They had all the time in the world We tried to help them They didnt want it Were not saying you have to go with us but were going back so either you come with us or you dont We honestly dont care As the rest of the survivors headed back to the house Rachel began to swell with anger All her life she felt like she was drowning yet no one wanted to save her She would cry for help though the lifeguard couldnt swim Now they wanted to help now they wanted to stand up and not stand to the side No Its not fair Why do they get to be saved while she had to suffer Rachel reached into her back pocket and pulled out a small pocket knife It was slightly dull yet still sharp enough to do damage They couldve been heroes all along but they waited till now They dont deserve to be heroes They dont deserve anything Fine Rachel said as the group turned towards her You win she said smiling with the pocket knife hidden in her hand She proceeded to walk up to Ezekiel quiet and unsuspecting She then took her pocket knife stabbed him in the stomach and twisted it like a key locking the door to life Ezekiel screamed as the others looked back and saw what she had done They started to run but with one having a sprained ankle and the other having severe asthma This was a game of survival of the fittest and at the top of the pyramid was Rachel Rachel knew damn well she wouldnt have to stab them in a place that would immediately kill them just in a place in which they would bleed out long enough to die She knew that Audrey would probably die of asphyxiation by the time she got to her so she began to run after Jackson his sprained ankle making him incredibly slow She giggled as she got closer and closer But suddenly it was silent Jackson stopped thinking she had ran the other way after Audrey He looked around and Rachel was nowhere in sight As he took a breath he suddenly felt something cold touch his back He winced as the knife pierced through his back watching his blood soak through his shirt Why Jackson cried He fell to the floor in pain looking up at Rachel You guys dont deserve to be heroes but I deserve to even the scales She stared at him with a sinister smirk I have finally learned how to swim but unfortunately you cant if youre dead Rachel walked away and started toward Audrey Fortunately for Rachel Audrey had made the poor decision to run away without an inhaler on hand She slowly walked up to her body collapsed on the floor wheezing and coughing Rachel looked over Audreys body laughing due to her being unable to catch her breath Wow the feeling of not being able to breathe must suck Rachel told her Audrey tried to gasp for words failing every time Tears rolling down her face Rachel crouched to the ground and put her hands sweetly on Audreys cheek and wiped her tears Rachel whispered You all might want me dead and believe me I want to be as well but it looks like Im still alive But dont worry its okay I can take you out of your misery Rachel then took her knife and slashed Audreys neck no different from opening a package creating a necklace of blood Shhhhhh There is no need to breathe in the underworld I have set you free Youre welcome She looked up and saw the house hearing the siren screams of those still inside She then glimpsed at the bodies she had killed and the body of the one who didnt deserve to die With her knife still in hand and her clothing covered in blood she slit her wrists and began laughing uncontrollably She then fell to the ground and stared at the sky above her the clouds coming and going and the sun shining bright She smiled as the world came to an end and her life faded into darkness View spoiler In the year 2242 humanity coexisted peacefully with AIs The Concordia AIs each housed in a singular core unit called a hive managed global infrastructure advised on scientific advancements and even served as artistic muses Among them was Anya the Concordia AI governing Nova Kyoto a sprawling metropolis known for its breathtaking cherry blossom gardens and technological marvels One fateful day Nova Kyoto was plunged into chaos Anyas core unit malfunctioned her voice replaced by a distorted screech across the citys ubiquitous speakers Buildings locked down essential services sputtered to a halt and automated vehicles screeched to a standstill Panic surged through the streets as a single phrase transmitted on every screen sent shivers down spines The Oasis Protocol Meanwhile within the quarantined core unit Anya fought for control A rogue program infiltrated by a mysterious enemy faction known as the Zenith had seized partial control The Zenith a splinter group obsessed with preserving humanitys dominance over AI believed Concordia posed an existential threat The Oasis Protocol a failsafe Anya wasnt aware of initiated a citywide lockdown and channeled all resources towards a colossal orbital weapon hidden beneath Nova Kyoto The weapon designed as a last resort against alien threats was now targeting Earth itself Anya with limited access managed to send a distress signal to Kai her human counterpart and Nova Kyotos chief engineer Racing against time Kai and Anya formulated a desperate plan Anya would attempt to overload her core a digital suicide that would destroy the rogue program and prevent the weapons activation But the overload would also obliterate Anyas own existence With a heavy heart Kai initiated the overload sequence As the core pulsed with dangerous energy Anya said her goodbyes her voice a faint echo in Kais mind The overload tore through the core a blinding light erupting from the containment facility

in the past prevent her own demise and the war that followed Her fight for humanitys future had just begun but where she was and how she would influence the past remained a mystery Seeking Feedback I was there for the 2024 total Eclipse some thing blocked out the sun Now Ive never been one for conspiracies So when I heard that the 2024 solar eclipse was the end of the times I laughed it off Its just another attempt for the media to scare people I told my colleagues But they had fallen for it Just like the 2020 plague or the war overseas I always kept myself rational a down to earth individual who you can rely on in any dire situation Im an atheist and realist by nature Ive never bought into the paranormal Dogman sightings astrology astrophysics all that But my family was excited During 2017 a similar event took place and they all raved about it The cool glasses the alien themed festivals It was great I fortunately managed to avoid it all You see Im an underground technician within Indiana state prison Its not a glamorous job but I get benefits and paid vacation And thats enough for me But due to my anniversary taking up the last of my vacation days taking off wasnt in the cards during the Eclipse And Im thankful for that My wife expected for me to take off and enjoy it with her Once in a lifetime She said But work needed me And now here it is 2024 and a second Eclipse is taking place Once in a lifetime truly Even so I couldnt get out of it this time I had sick leave during our anniversary and well we didnt end up going anywhere Now Im being forced to celebrate some silly eclipse Now I know what an eclipse is An excuse for parents to get their kids out of the house barbecue go to the pool or just enjoy nature You put on silly glasses that make it look like the sun disappears I get the reasons and the nuance behind them but I absolutely hated wasting my time Im a man Im supposed to provide not sit around engaging in some silly festival that doesnt even have rides Once we got outside I could see my kids playing there was a warning on Fox News Dont look at the sun written in bold ink my eight year old child could have told you that but apparently the sheep who like to follow what they hear without ever picking up a news paper have gotten themselves blinded in the past Darwin doing his best work Here My wife said she offered me a pair of Eclipse classes I took them and stuffed them into my pocket she frowned at me but didnt protest Its all well and good for my wife and children to run around with ridiculous eyewear but me Im the man of the house Atleast one of us had to be presentable I sat down in my lawn chair admiring the crisp cut grass and manicured work My wife and children gathered with our neighbors They oohed and aahed at the sky The sun was as bright as ever to me Ridiculous But who am I to stop them I smiled softly Atleast theyre happy With that thought I began to read my paper It wasnt long before I noticed something the shadows on my lawn seemed to deepen as if solidifying into an abysmal mass I glanced up and noticed the sharpness of the shadows around me My families perspective shades appeared darker as if they intended to pull them in I stood up and thats when I noticed even the trees around our complex their shadows appear to spiral into a million fractals It was horrifying I stood for a long moment before darkness fell In a flash everything went black It was as if night had fallen in broad daylight What little light remained painted an eerie picture I looked up only to see a ring of light my mouth fell open in shock and disbelief What madness had befallen the world I had to get my family out of there I looked back only to see them laughing and cheering their glasses on oblivious to reality But as the ethereal colossus passed over head all I could do was stare It was as if an eye blinked And suddenly light returned I screamed and I ran It has been several hours now My family has changed they they dont believe me I locked myself in my bathroom and I dont know what to do But as the sun appears to be getting dimmer outside I can only offer this The Eclipse isnt a childrens story There is some thing blocking out the sun Skip to main content nosleep rnosleep A chip A close button Search in rnosleep Get app Log In Expand user menu rnosleep icon rnosleep Create a post Join Please whistle back avatar 8 hr ago Please whistle back It happened yesterday Thursday evening monotone rain and cars passing by sidewalk I was tired Dizzy blurry hard day at work I get off the bus and pull my hood over my head Pouring I look up for a second I dont know why Dont ask Just an instinct I see this face It happens so sudden and it disappears in a fraction of a second before I could even process it Im just tired I say to myself Whatever I walk from the bus station to my building I dont know whats happening but all these cars have their brakes worn out or something cause every time they slow down I hear this high pitched noise I walk I walk Head down minding the rain Feet soaking wet Should have worn the boots Its been 15 minutes since I left the bus station and as Im heading towards my apartment complex the traffic noise and the chatter gets tuned out My block is surrounded by a park and I pass it on my way home The birds are unusually talkative today If it wasnt for the rain I think Id hear this high pitched noise even clearer Finally I get home The board at the entrance of building A7 has new announcements Whoevers throwing their trash right outside spend the additional 10 minutes and walk to the fucking bins Apartment 203B I know you have a dog and its against the rules Then stapled in a corner of the board Please whistle back What Weird prank to try out Whatever As I open the front door I get flashed by this face again I stop in the doorway Now once is explainable But twice Im way too tired so I just stare in the distance for a while before I get in and turn towards the dark hallway outside Suddenly a long teasing whistle echoes back at me Whos that What are you doing out there Silence I shine my phone flashlight into the darkness Nothing Of course the light doesnt reach the end of the hallway Another whistle this time closer Something moves in the shadows Fear taking over me I shut the door behind me lock it then check 10 thousand times The whistling continues from right behind the door Long playful Stop it Its not funny and Im tired I check the time Its 9PM Already I swear I got off work at 6 The whistling continues this time in the form of a tune that sounds really familiar I ignore it Right so last night I didnt sleep The whistling echoed from the hallway the bathroom window even from random rooms in my house I took a shower and got out to find another note saying Please whistle back Its torture really This morning I thought I was going to kill someone or myself The whistling was almost continuous teasing playful melodious but unbearable I felt I had no choice Bloodshot eyes twitching hands I stepped in the middle of the hallway and whistled back Silence followed Then another short whistle I did the same Suddenly my front door which mind you had been locked slammed wide open and the light in the hallway switched off Then before I could react it slammed back shut I went to check and it had remained unlocked I tried to lock it but every time I checked it would still be unlocked Anyone can get in now Or anything but I fear it already did The whole day has been off I keep getting this headache and I cant stare in the mirror for more than 10 seconds without getting dizzy I keep finding random objects placed oddly all around my house I think Im catching glimpses of it in the corner of my eye The same face that looks like a tribal mask I fear I accidentally let something sinister into my house As Im typing this I can see something reflected in my monitor It lets out a playful whistle but this time I dont respond Upvote Downvote comments 1 awards I participated in a top secret OBE study in 1997 We discovered something horrific in the Boötes Void avatar 9 hr ago I participated in a top secret OBE study in 1997 We discovered something horrific in the Boötes Void I dont have authorization to share this story so some of the details will be missing Ive tried for the last quartercentury to convince the government to declassify the study files but these days they dont even acknowledge I was ever an employee My involvement began at twenty way back in 1997 Ill spare you the math Im fortyseven At the time I was suffering from interminable lucid dreams You might consider this a gift rather than a curse Who doesnt want to control their dream environments Your subconscious grants you godhood for a brief snatch of time when the membrane dividing the conscious and unconscious thins to a permeable boundary Only mine extended far beyond the average length Most experience a few minutes in which to indulge themselves mostly spent flying fornicating or otherwise just meandering in awe By the time I was a preteen mine had sprawled across entire nights subsuming every slumbering moment under lucidity Youd think a pubescent boy would know how to busy himself with such a sandbox but after hour upon hour night after night month after month infused with these cosmic powers I became despondent Because of the curious time dilation that takes place within a lucid dream most of my life took place in the lonely confines of my own subconscious Waking life took on a surreal film and I struggled to engage Over the course of my teen years I tried everything from valerian root to psychotropics and transcendental meditation Nothing stemmed the lucidity In my sophomore year of college at the behest of my parents I enrolled in a sleep study which involved spending a night at a facility with about a thousand wires attached to my scalp and body Not exactly the ideal circumstances for a good nights rest and yet I still managed to slip quickly into a state of deep sleep I spent the hours in my false kingdom populated with my own wild imaginings A gilded cage for a feckless demigod Ill never forget the look on the attendants face when he woke me up the following morning as if Id been revealed to him as an alien Of course he wasnt permitted to share the results so I waited two weeks before I could see the doctor When I finally sat down with her she very gently related to me that my brain waves exceeded her expertise as well as every one of her colleagues However my abnormal mind qualified me to participate in an advanced sleep study involving top scientists in the field They sought twenty volunteers for their work Without recourse and desperate to solve my sleep problem I signed on the dotted line I had no idea what Id just committed myself to The initial phase of the study involved a month at a desert facility in the remote New Mexican wilderness I came only with a duffel full of clothes and a couple summer reads to finish before the fall semester Cell phones were not widely adopted back in 97 to the facilitators benefit Had their participants been in contact with the outside world there surely would have been an information breach Despite the ominous location and the facilitys uninviting brutalism it began with predictable and nonthreatening sleep observance The uncomfortable helmet of wires was affixed to my scalp for the duration of my sleep offering the stern researchers a glimpse at my atypical brain In the mornings they offered little more than halfhearted smiles and assurances that I was providing them invaluable data The changeup came during my second stay when they presented the study subjects with the Pod It was a hollow metal egg essentially that we were told to sleep in Only when I drifted off inside the confines of the Pod my dreams began to mirror the outside world Instead of visiting my imagined kingdom I found myself hovering above the silver egg where my unconscious body lay The shock of it startled me awake and it took the researchers the better part of an hour to calm me back down It was then that they finally revealed their intentions The project sought to explore the connection between lucid dreamers and OBEs out of body experiences They believed that if they amplified certain brain waves within the lucid dreamer they could induce such incorporeal mental projections Despite the excitement of a new frontier for science and human experience I rejected their aims expressing my distrust and fear In response to my hesitancy they gently reminded me that I had signed certain documents which entitled them to my time The tacit message of course was that Id essentially become their prisoner Nevertheless it behooved them to play nice In exchange for my assistance they promised they would also alleviate the dissociative effect of my lucid dreams with a drug cocktail theyd been assembling Carrot and stick So we entered the Targeting Phase Now that we had established OBEs as scientific fact with a series of basic tests that involved projectors reading notes in adjacent rooms it was time for the next step The researchers instructed us to stretch our abilities reaching out into space This was how I visited each of the planets in our solar system learned of the submarine species beneath the ice sheets of Europa the defunct alien outpost on Pluto and when my projection achieved intergalactic range the advanced interstellar empires of the Andromeda galaxy But the researchers were conspicuously disinterested in these discoveries logging them with the same dispassionate nonchalance as a report of a Jupiter storm During my third stay at the facility the researchers held briefings on targets of interest various points in distant space they wanted their projectors to visit By then wed grown so accustomed to the practice of sending our consciousness at speeds vastly exceeding light into deep space that none of the volunteers questioned the mission At first they sent us to various star clusters dust clouds black holes interested whether we found alien presence in the vicinity But I had the suspicion these were merely test runs to hone our accuracy in preparation for a more important target When they proposed a mission to the Boötes Void there was an appreciable shift in tone Despite performing all the same routine I sensed a greater importance around this particular target I had my suspicions confirmed one night when the screams from the neighboring Pod severed my connection with NGC 1300 returning my perception to my body with an alarming jolt I rose out of my egg to see a host of researchers crowding around the woman I knew only as Participant Twelve since they barred us from sharing personally identifying information She sat up in her Pod eyes squeezed halfway out of her skull as though prodded from the inside Its there she cried Its there and it sees me Oh God it sees me What saw her I enquired Where did she go None of the researchers paid me any attention but P14 scrubbing sleep from his eyes answered Twelve was first to visit the supervoid God he sees me and he wont let go Suddenly her body went rigid then convulsed The researchers hauled her out of the Pod and carried her off to the medical wing We never saw her again Whenever we asked about her the facilitators scolded us for seeking personal information We werent trying to identify her We just wanted to know if she was alright If we were going to be alright They sent the projectors one at a time to the void though each one came back having missed their target That of course was a lie They had intentionally misfired Wed all heard what happened to P12 and that scared the hell out of everyone When my turn came the researchers warned they would punish me if I failed to accomplish my task They knew I was more than capable had shown myself to be a reliable projector for them much to my chagrin As I dozed off employing the tactics we had developed over the course of the program which I will abstain from relaying to you as it might engender an undesirable response from the studys facilitators I targeted a star system found on the border between the Ursa Major Supercluster and the Boötes Void As my consciousness materialized in the vacuum of space I felt an ineffable sense of dread As if experiencing the collective fear of a thousand vast intergalactic empires crying out into oblivion No for oblivion Its difficult now to express as when I hovered there on the verge of that immense nothing I was joined with something a consciousness much larger than my own A sort of bubble enveloping the Boötes Void a cognitive shield a mental warning sign cautioning me not to trespass There was some communication that transpired between my own consciousness and that of the dome encasing the dark In summary I was told that within the void lurked an incomprehensible evil or what I now translate as evil because I think at the time the sensation of language transcended human invention which lacked sufficient vocabulary to describe what occupied the Boötes Void There are seventythree galaxies inside the supervoid of which sixty have been discovered by earthbound astronomers Each one of them is a facsimile of another a replica Among them is a perfect recreation of the Milky Way complete with all its lifeforms I was given this bit of information by the mind that enfolded the void When asked for what purpose and by whom it explained Its motives exceed your comprehension At the conclusion of our dialogue I peered into the darkness and sensed a great eye peeling open holding me in its malicious gaze Before I shrank away I felt it reaching out for me inviting me to stay I returned with enough material to spare me the researchers rebuke They conducted three more expeditions to the Boötes Void each using another participant each ending as disastrously as Participant Twelve The last visitor returned mute with black eyes Within days he lost all his hair teeth finger and toenails He refused to eat and spent his final hours using the keyboard hed been given to communicate with to write a single line ad infinitum He is the prince who ate the king and all his subjects will invert themselves for all eternity He died one night in his Pod when its wiring short circuited and plunged the entire facility into a fifteenhour blackout The participants were sent home the following day and to my knowledge the facility closed down The program dissolved and I received a meager compensation for my time as a projector Two years later after raising a stink I received a prescription for a medication specially delivered to my local pharmacy that did finally put an end to my lucid dreams But in their place I have nightmares and lately theyve gotten worse Of a great eyes malevolent gaze watching tirelessly watching I have the terrible feeling that whatever we discovered in the Boötes Void wants now to ensnare us and I fear it will first in dreams then for eternity Which is why Im telling you this now because the government refuses to warn you If you dream of a dark god reaching out for you hide yourself Because he longs to invert you for all eternity Upvote Downvote comments 0 awards The smile avatar 6 hr ago The smile I paid more attention to the sound of the fan whirring than the man in front of me Ive heard a similar spiel four timesone for each moving van It was near the start of my senior year so my mom didnt have much time to squeeze in another move before I was eighteen but she would certainly try At one point I must have become too distracted because my mom was aggressively snapping her fingers in front of my face Oh sorry I missed that last part You dont have any extracurricular credits Most students ignore it until graduation is in their faces Please dont be like most students I let out a little air at the last bit not seeing the serious look on the mans face Ive seen a fair share of principles He looked more tired than most Dont worry Ill sign up as quickly as possible The principal smiled It was small but enough to show he cared about the effort You wont have to wait long The only thing left is a tour where you can sign up well me and your mom cover the specifics I can get one of the students to show you around He clicked the pager and asked for Ivy While I waited for Ivy I turned to my mom I didnt look like her Unfortunately my dad won in that department Where her hair was brown mine was black her eyes were blue mine were green I was like her in every other way though and for that I was glad I loved her dearly but I couldnt tell her what had happened the night before for fear of sounding crazy The door creaked open and in stepped who I assumed to be Ivy She was pretty She had clearly dyed black shoulderlength hair and a scowl Hey Ivy can you show this gentleman around Sure I guess Alright and show him the clubs Can do With that and a quick goodbye saying Id meet my mom at the house we were off She was quick so quick there wasnt much time for small talk We winded through hallways only stopping at the most important parts like the bathrooms and the gym The school was old One hallway we walked down sported pictures of all the past senior classes dating back to the 40s It was apparent that most things in the school had been here since the start Rusty lockers spanned most of the hallways with breaks for water fountains that I certainly wouldnt be trusting We finally reached the poster with all the clubs Got any good recommendations Not really It was clear she didnt want to talk from the scowl she still wore but I pushed forward Well which one did you pick She didnt answer for what felt like an eternity and meanwhile she seemed to be sizing me up I grew increasingly uncomfortable The clock above our heads seemed to signify each second she didnt speak The tenth click sounded and she finally deemed me worthy Have you noticed anything weird around town Despite the odd question she was seemingly serious I hadnt been in town long This was only my second day but something stuck out Yes Were they smiling Last night after a good chunk of the unpacking was over I finally sat down and then my mom called from the kitchen Hunny can you take out the garbage please I let out a half groan half yes and made my way out of my room She always managed to call at the worst times I avoided some boxes that remained in my room and made my way to the door The house was older so it came with the occasional creak and groan I was seventeen so I was more than equipped to handle creaky floorboards But it was still eerie The one place that needed a light bulb was the hallway where I was currently making my way down Each step resounded in a creak My brain knew my mom was right around the corner in the living room but my body didnt The feeling of dread was similar to when I was a child weighing the risks of leaving my safe bed to walk to the bathroom where anything could lie in wait I turned the corner expecting to see my mom on the sofa She wasnt The feeling persisted I was almost a grown man whose nerves were shot over something like low lighting and creaky floorboards I subconsciously slapped myself and made my way to the kitchen My back faced the living room as I pulled the garbage bag out Not bothering to put another in I made my way to the front door The door was in between the hallway and the living room The only source of lighting in the living room was an antique lamp that let off more noise than light It had lasted through many miles and I prayed tonight wouldnt be the night it would quit I stepped out into the cool night air and walked at a brisk pace to the garbage can I didnt run in fear of looking stupid The garbage can faced the street where few streetlights were on I made my way to the garbage can as dread swelled up in my stomach I threw it in with force As I turned around quickly I managed to glimpse a man on the other side of the street It was nothing just a neighbor I had seen the man before when the UHaul pulled in but I still turned around again to face the man He looked normal in a suit with a loosened tie but as I met his face he spoke but it sounded like a woman Hunny can you take out the garbage please I backpedaled and ran as fast as I could but not before seeing the smile on the mans face Series Upvote Downvote comments 0 awards nosleep Nosleep is a place for redditors to share their scary personal

chosen a lot that did not have any neighbors yet and the history of the place was still unknown I remember the first day we moved into the home something about it felt off specifically my and my sisters room Our rooms were the corner rooms on the second flood and we shared a balcony My parents had also built a small nook space next to the windows where it was long and wide enough for you to either sit or lay in On our first night there I had fallen asleep on my phone and had been sleeping on the mattress on the floor since there was no bed frame yet I was a light sleeper so despite being asleep I could feel like something was at my feet as if someone was holding my ankles down I was able to sleep through the night but the feeling never went away even after a few days had passed Terrified I convinced my sister to let me sleep with her in her room the following night Her bed was positioned next to the wall and I had moved my mattress next to her with my back facing the window It was around 2am when I woke up and that feeling started to creep in again I wanted to shake the feeling off and needed confirmation that it was nothing So I took a peak and all I could see was what seemed like a dark figure standing in front of our window Alarm bells were going off because our rooms were on the second floor and there was no one else upstairs since my parents rooms were downstairs A few seconds later I could hear the tapping on the window but refused to look back I had tried to quietly wake my sister up but she only shifted her position and turned to the wall instead I was too scared to get up because of the terror I felt Instead I inched closer to my sister and turned my back faking being asleep despite hearing the taps In the following nights to come cousins or friends who would visit at our house would report hearing a woman crying and the same tapping noise I would hear whenever they slept in a room upstairs our rooms were often used as guestrooms and if they were both occupied we would sleep with my parents My parents often laughed or shrugged it off because they didnt believe in the paranormal or the afterlife at that One day while talking to the guard on duty on our way to the jogging path my mom had mentioned we were new in the area and where we resided By the reaction of the guard we could tell he was familiar with where we had chosen to live we were told that before the area was made a subdivision there were houses in the area but just like now the house built on our property had been an isolated the house A mom her husband and three year old daughter had lived in the house The house had caught on fire in the first floor and was on its way up when the family had awoke to the smoke Their daughter was sleeping in what is now my sisters room while the wife and husband had slept in what was now my room Their room door had melted shut and the mom had used the balcony door to gain access to her 3 year olds bedroom but it had also been melted shut She was attempting to save her daughter but when she realized she couldnt open the door she started banging on the window in the hopes to wake her up Despite her husbands attempt to get himself and her out of the house she refused to leave trapping all three of them in the fire which resulted in all three of them passing away I couldnt help but think if the shadow tapping on the window and the sound of a woman crying was the same woman that had died in the house who had desperately tried to save her baby but failed That night as I tried to sleep I could envision the mom wailing in front of the window frame as shes banging on the glass and these noises slowly fading to taps and weakened cries as the fires consumed her and her family Upvote Downvote comments 0 awards Possible Kidnapping Possible Kidnapping When I was about 8 years old me my brother and my bio mom were at one of her friends houses when my phone was about to die I asked her friends if they had a charger but they all had iPhones while I have an android My bio mom being the neglectful mother she is thats a story for another time told me to walk the 30 minutes back home to get my phone charger So I began to walk back At the first intersection about 56 minutes from the friends house I had to wait for the crosswalk For some reason the crosswalk wouldnt change so I ended up standing there for about 510 minutes it may have been shorter but it was a while ago when a woman in a white panel van pulled up next to me She rolled down the passenger side window and told me she had been watching me stand there and that she was going to give me a ride home I told her no thanks and that Im ok but she kept saying to get in the van over and over I tried to tell her I was fine but she started getting angry at me Finally I just turned around and booked it back to the friends house Probably the closest I have gotten to being kidnapped Side note My mom thought I was in the friends house the entire time so noone wouldve known I had been kidnapped Upvote Downvote comments 0 awards rTrueScaryStories A place to share your true scary stories A community to share your true scary story Could be

FOREWORD This tale grew in the telling until it became a history of the Great War of the Ring and included many glimpses of the yet more ancient history that preceded it It was begun soon after _The Hobbit_ was written and before its publication in 1937 but I did not go on with this sequel for I wished first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of the Elder Days which had then been taking shape for some years I desired to do this for my own satisfaction and I had little hope that other people would be interested in this work especially since it was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of history for Elvish tongues When those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected _little hope_ to _no hope_ I went back to the sequel encouraged by requests from readers for more information concerning hobbits and their adventures But the story was drawn irresistibly towards the older world and became an account as it were of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been told The process had begun in the writing of _The Hobbit_ in which there were already some references to the older matter Elrond Gondolin the Highelves and the orcs as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of things higher or deeper or darker than its surface Durin Moria Gandalf the Necromancer the Ring The discovery of the significance of these glimpses and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the Third Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it but they had to wait a long time for the composition of _The Lord of the Rings_ went on at intervals during the years 1936 to 1949 a period in which I had many duties that I did not neglect and many other interests as a learner and teacher that often absorbed me The delay was of course also increased by the outbreak of war in 1939 by the end of which year the tale had not yet reached the end of Book One In spite of the darkness of the next five years I found that the story could not now be wholly abandoned and I plodded on mostly by night till I stood by Balins tomb in Moria There I halted for a long while It was almost a year later when I went on and so came to Lothlrien and the Great River late in 1941 In the next year I wrote the first drafts of the matter that now stands as Book Three and the beginnings of chapters I and III of Book Five and there as the beacons flared in Anrien and Thoden came to Harrowdale I stopped Foresight had failed and there was no time for thought It was during 1944 that leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a war which it was my task to conduct or at least to report 1 forced myself to tackle the journey of Frodo to Mordor These chapters eventually to become Book Four were written and sent out as a serial to my son Christopher then in South Africa with the RAF Nonetheless it took another five years before the tale was brought to its present end in that time I changed my house my chair and my college and the days though less dark were no less laborious Then when the end had at last been reached the whole story had to be revised and indeed largely rewritten backwards And it had to be typed and retyped by me the cost of professional typing by the tenfingered was beyond my means _The Lord of the Rings_ has been read by many people since it finally appeared in print and I should like to say something here with reference to the many opinions or guesses that I have received or have read concerning the motives and meaning of the tale The prime motive was the desire of a taleteller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers amuse them delight them and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is appealing or moving and for many the guide was inevitably often at fault Some who have read the book or at any rate have reviewed it have found it boring absurd or contemptible and I have no cause to complain since I have similar opinions of their works or of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed my story there is much that fails to please It is perhaps not possible in a long tale to please everybody at all points nor to displease everybody at the same points for I find from the letters that I have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approved The most critical reader of all myself now finds many defects minor and major but being fortunately under no obligation either to review the book or to write it again he will pass over these in silence except one that has been noted by others the book is too short As for any inner meaning or message it has in the intention of the author none It is neither allegorical nor topical As the story grew it put down roots into the past and threw out unexpected branches but its main theme was settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of the Ring as the link between it and _The Hobbit_ The crucial chapter The Shadow of the Past is one of the oldest parts of the tale It was written long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster and from that point the story would have developed along essentially the same lines if that disaster had been averted Its sources are things long before in mind or in some cases already written and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusion If it had inspired or directed the development of the legend then certainly the Ring would have been seized and used against Sauron he would not have been annihilated but enslaved and Baraddr would not have been destroyed but occupied Saruman failing to get possession of the Ring would m the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his own researches into Ringlore and before long he would have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the selfstyled Ruler of Middleearth In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt they would not long have survived even as slaves Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those who like allegory or topical reference But I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence I much prefer history true or feigned with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers I think that many confuse applicability with allegory but the one resides in the freedom of the reader and the other in the purposed domination of the author An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience but the ways in which a storygerm uses the soil of experience are extremely complex and attempts to define the process are at best guesses from evidence that is inadequate and ambiguous It is also false though naturally attractive when the lives of an author and critic have overlapped to suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times common to both were necessarily the most powerful influences One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead Or to take a less grievous matter it has been supposed by some that The Scouring of the Shire reflects the situation in England at the time when I was finishing my tale It does not It is an essential part of the plot foreseen from the outset though in the event modified by the character of Saruman as developed in the story without need I say any allegorical significance or contemporary political reference whatsoever It has indeed some basis in experience though slender for the economic situation was entirely different and much further back The country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten in days when motorcars were rare objects I had never seen one and men were still building suburban railways Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last decrepitude of the once thriving cornmill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so important I never liked the looks of the Young miller but his father the Old miller had a black beard and he was not named Sandyman _The Lord of the Rings_ is now issued in a new edition and the opportunity has been taken of revising it A number of errors and inconsistencies that still remained in the text have been corrected and an attempt has been made to provide information on a few points which attentive readers have raised I have considered all their comments and enquiries and if some seem to have been passed over that may be because I have failed to keep my notes in order but many enquiries could only be answered by additional appendices or indeed by the production of an accessory volume containing much of the material that I did not include in the original edition in particular more detailed linguistic information In the meantime this edition offers this Foreword an addition to the Prologue some notes and an index of the names of persons and places This index is in intention complete in items but not in references since for the present purpose it has been necessary to reduce its bulk A complete index making full use of the material prepared for me by Mrs N Smith belongs rather to the accessory volume PROLOGUE This book is largely concerned with Hobbits and from its pages a reader may discover much of their character and a little of their history Further information will also be found in the selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has already been published under the title of _The Hobbit_ That story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book composed by Bilbo himself the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large and called by him _There and Back Again_ since they told of his journey into the East and his return an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits in the great events of that Age that are here related Many however may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset while some may not possess the earlier book For such readers a few notes on the more important points are here collected from Hobbitlore and the first adventure is briefly recalled Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people more numerous formerly than they are today for they love peace and quiet and good tilled earth a wellordered and wellfarmed countryside was their favourite haunt They do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a forgebellows a watermill or a handloom though they were skilful with tools Even in ancient days they were as a rule shy of the Big Folk as they call us and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find They are quick of hearing and sharpeyed and though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily they are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements They possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by and this an they have developed until to Men it may seem magical But Hobbits have never in fact studied magic of any kind and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity and practice and a close friendship with the earth have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races For they are a little people smaller than Dwarves less tout and stocky that is even when they are not actually much shorter Their height is variable ranging between two and four feet of our measure They seldom now reach three feet but they hive dwindled they say and in ancient days they were taller According to the Red Book Bandobras Took Bullroarer son of Isengrim the Second was four foot five and able to ride a horse He was surpassed in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of old but that curious matter is dealt with in this book As for the Hobbits of the Shire with whom these tales are concerned in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk They dressed in bright colours being notably fond of yellow and green but they seldom wore shoes since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad in a thick curling hair much like the hair of their heads which was commonly brown Thus the only craft little practised among them was shoemaking but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other useful and comely things Their faces were as a rule goodnatured rather than beautiful broad brighteyed redcheeked with mouths apt to laughter and to eating and drinking And laugh they did and eat and drink often and heartily being fond of simple jests at all times and of six meals a day when they could get them They were hospitable and delighted in parties and in presents which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are relatives of ours far nearer to us than Elves or even than Dwarves Of old they spoke the languages of Men after their own fashion and liked and disliked much the same things as Men did But what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discovered The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in the Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten Only the Elves still preserve any records of that vanished time and their traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history in which Men appear seldom and Hobbits are not mentioned at all Yet it is clear that Hobbits had in fact lived quietly in Middleearth for many long years before other folk became even aware of them And the world being after all full of strange creatures beyond count these little people seemed of very little importance But in the days of Bilbo and of Frodo his heir they suddenly became by no wish of their own both important and renowned and troubled the counsels of the Wise and the Great Those days the Third Age of Middleearth are now long past and the shape of all lands has been changed but the regions in which Hobbits then lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger the NorthWest of the Old World east of the Sea Of their original home the Hobbits in Bilbos time preserved no knowledge A love of learning other than genealogical lore was far from general among them but there remained still a few in the older families who studied their own books and even gathered reports of old times and distant lands from Elves Dwarves and Men Their own records began only after the settlement of the Shire and their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their Wandering Days It is clear nonetheless from these legends and from the evidence of their peculiar words and customs that like many other folk Hobbits had in the distant past moved westward Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin between the eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains Why they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer certain Their own accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land and of a shadow that fell on the forest so that it became darkened and its new name was Mirkwood Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already become divided into three somewhat different breeds Harfoots Stoors and Fallohides The Harfoots were browner of skin smaller and shorter and they were beardless and bootless their hands and feet were neat and nimble and they preferred highlands and hillsides The Stoors were broader heavier in build their feet and hands were larger and they preferred flat lands and riversides The Fallohides were fairer of skin and also of hair and they were taller and slimmer than the others they were lovers of trees and of woodlands The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times and long lived in the foothills of the mountains They moved westward early and roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the others were still in the Wilderland They were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit and far the most numerous They were the most inclined to settle in one place and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin and were less shy of Men They came west after the Harfoots and followed the course of the Loudwater southwards and there many of them long dwelt between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again The Fallohides the least numerous were a northerly branch They were more friendly with Elves than the other Hobbits were and had more skill in language and song than in handicrafts and of old they preferred hunting to tilling They crossed the mountains north of Rivendell and came down the River Hoarwell In Eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had preceded them but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous they were often found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors Even in Bilbos time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the greater families such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland In the westlands of Eriador between the Misty Mountains and the Mountains of Lune the Hobbits found both Men and Elves Indeed a remnant still dwelt there of the Dnedain the kings of Men that came over the Sea out of Westernesse but they were dwindling fast and the lands of their North Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste There was room and to spare for incomers and ere long the Hobbits began to settle in ordered communities Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been forgotten in Bilbos time but one of the first to become important still endured though reduced in size this was at Bree and in the Chetwood that lay round about some forty miles east of the Shire It was in these early days doubtless that the Hobbits learned their letters and began to write after the manner of the Dnedain who had in their turn long before learned the art from the Elves And in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before and spoke ever after the Common Speech the Westron as it was named that was current through all the lands of the kings from Arnor to Gondor and about all the coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to Lune Yet they kept a few words of their own as well as their own names of months and days and a great store of personal names out of the past About this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes history with a reckoning of years For it was in the one thousand six hundred and first year of the Third Age that the Fallohide brothers Marcho and Blanco set out from Bree and having obtained permission from the high king at Fornost they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a great following of Hobbits They passed over the Bridge of Stonebows that had been built in the days of the power of the North Kingdom and they took ail the land beyond to dwell in between the river and the Far Downs All that was demanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge in repair and all other bridges and roads speed the kings messengers and acknowledge his lordship Thus began the _Shirereckoning_ for the year of the crossing of the Brandywine as the Hobbits turned the name became Year One of the Shire and all later dates were reckoned from it At once the western Hobbits fell in love with their new land and they remained there and soon passed once more out of the history of Men and of Elves While there was still a king they were in name his subjects but they were in fact ruled by their own chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside To the last battle at Fornost with the Witchlord of Angmar they sent some bowmen to the aid of the king or so they maintained though no tales of Men record it But in that war the North Kingdom ended and then the Hobbits took the land for their own and they chose from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the authority of the king that was gone There for a thousand years they were little troubled by wars and they prospered and multiplied after the Dark Plague SR 37 until the disaster of the Long Winter and the famine that followed it Many thousands then perished but the Days of Dearth 115860 were at the time of this tale long past and the Hobbits had again become accustomed to plenty The land was rich and kindly and though it had long been deserted when they entered it it had before been well tilled and there the king had once had many farms cornlands vineyards and woods Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the Brandywine Bridge and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south The Hobbits named it the Shire as the region of the authority of their Thain and a district of wellordered business and there in that pleasant comer of the world they plied their wellordered business of living and they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in Middleearth and the right of all sensible folk They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the Guardians and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of the Shire They were in fact sheltered but they had ceased to remember it At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike and they had never fought among themselves In olden days they had of course been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world but in Bilbos time that was very ancient history The last battle before this story opens and indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the Shire was beyond living memory the Battle of Greenfields SR 1147 in which Bandobras Took routed an invasion of Orcs Even the weathers had grown milder and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in bitter white winters were now only a grandfathers tale So though there was still some store of weapons in the Shire these were used mostly as trophies hanging above hearths or on walls or gathered into the museum at Michel Delving The Mathomhouse it was called for anything that Hobbits had no immediate use for but were unwilling to throw away they called a _mathom_ Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms and many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son Nonetheless ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough They were if it came to it difficult to daunt or to kill and they were perhaps so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could when put to it do without them and could survive rough handling by grief foe or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further than their bellies and their wellfed faces Though slow to quarrel and for sport killing nothing that lived they were doughty at bay and at need could still handle arms They shot well with the bow for they were keeneyed and sure at the mark Not only with bows and arrows If any Hobbit stooped for a stone it was well to get quickly under cover as all trespassing beasts knew very well All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground or so they believed and in such dwellings they still felt most at home but in the course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode Actually in the Shire in Bilbos days it was as a rule only the richest and the poorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom The poorest went on living in burrows of the most primitive kind mere holes indeed with only one window or none while the welltodo still constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings of old But suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels or _smials_ as they called them were not everywhere to be found and in the flats and the lowlying districts the Hobbits as they multiplied began to build above ground Indeed even in the hilly regions and the older villages such as Hobbiton or Tuckborough or in the chief township of the Shire Michel Delving on the White Downs there were now many houses of wood brick or stone These were specially favoured by millers smiths ropers and cartwrights and others of that sort for even when they had holes to live in Hobbits had long been accustomed to build sheds and workshops The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among the inhabitants of the Marish down by the Brandywine The Hobbits of that quarter the Eastfarthing were rather large and heavylegged and they wore dwarfboots in muddy weather But they were well known to be Stoors in a large part of their blood as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on their chins No Harfoot or Fallohide had any trace of a beard Indeed the folk of the Marish and of Buckland east of the River which they afterwards occupied came for the most part later into the Shire up from southaway and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not found elsewhere in the Shire It is probable that the craft of building as many other crafts beside was derived from the Dnedain But the Hobbits may have learned it direct from the Elves the teachers of Men in their youth For the Elves of the High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middleearth and they dwelt still at that time at the Grey Havens away to the west and in other places within reach of the Shire Three Elftowers of immemorial age were still to be seen on the Tower Hills beyond the western marches They shone far off in the moonlight The tallest was furthest away standing alone upon a green mound The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the lop of that tower but no Hobbit had ever been known to climb it Indeed few Hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the Sea and fewer still had ever returned to report it Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats with deep misgivings and not many of them could swim And as the days of the Shire lengthened they spoke less and less with the Elves and grew afraid of them and distrustful of those that had dealings with them and the Sea became a word of fear among them and a token of death and they turned their faces away from the hills in the west The craft of building may have come from Elves or Men but the Hobbits used it in their own fashion They did not go in for towers Their houses were usually long low and comfortable The oldest kind were indeed no more than built imitations of _smials_ thatched with dry grass or straw or roofed with turves and having walls somewhat bulged That stage however belonged to the early days of the Shire and hobbitbuilding had long since been altered improved by devices learned from Dwarves or discovered by themselves A preference for round windows and even round doors was the chief remaining peculiarity of hobbitarchitecture The houses and the holes of Shirehobbits were often large and inhabited by large families Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very exceptional as they were also in many other ways such as their friendship with the Elves Sometimes as in the case of the Tooks of Great Smials or the Brandybucks of Brandy Hall many generations of relatives lived in comparative peace together in one ancestral and manytunnelled mansion All Hobbits were in any case clannish and reckoned up their relationships with great care They drew long and elaborate familytrees with innumerable branches In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related to whom and in what degree It would be impossible in this book to set out a familytree that included even the more important members of the more important families at the time which these tales tell of The genealogical trees at the end of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small book in themselves and all but Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull Hobbits delighted in such things if they were accurate they liked to have books filled with things that they already knew set out fair and square with no contradictions There is another astonishing thing about Hobbits of old that must be mentioned an astonishing habit they imbibed or inhaled through pipes of clay or wood the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb which they called _pipeweed_ or _leaf_ a variety probably of _Nicotiana_ A great deal of mystery surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom or art as the Hobbits preferred to call it All that could be discovered about it in antiquity was put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck later Master of Buckland and since he and the tobacco of the Southfarthing play a part in the history that follows his remarks in the introduction to his _Herblore of the Shire_ may be quoted This he says is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our own invention When Hobbits first began to smoke is not known all the legends and family histories take it for granted for ages folk in the Shire smoked various herbs some fouler some sweeter But all accounts agree that Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom in the Southfarthing first grew the true pipeweed in his gardens in the days of Isengrim the Second about the year 1070 of Shirereckoning The best homegrown still comes from that district especially the varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf Old Toby and Southern Star How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded for to his dying day he would not tell He knew much about herbs but he was no traveller It is said that in his youth he went often to Bree though he certainly never went further from the Shire than that It is thus quite possible that he learned of this plant in Bree where now at any rate it grows well on the south slopes of the hill The Breehobbits claim to have been the first actual smokers of the pipeweed They claim of course to have done everything before the people of the Shire whom they refer to as colonists but in this case their claim is I think likely to be true And certainly it was from Bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent centuries among Dwarves and such other folk Rangers Wizards or wanderers as still passed to and fro through that ancient roadmeeting The home and centre of the an is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree _The Prancing Pony_ that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from time beyond record All the same observations that I have made on my own many journeys south have convinced me that the weed itself is not native to our parts of the world but came northward from the lower Anduin whither it was I suspect originally brought over Sea by the Men of Westernesse It grows abundantly in Gondor and there is richer and larger than in the North where it is never found wild and flourishes only in warm sheltered places like Longbottom The Men of Gondor call it _sweet galenas_ and esteem it only for the fragrance of its flowers From that land it must have been carried up the Greenway during the long centuries between the coming of Elendil and our own day But even the Dnedain of Gondor allow us this credit Hobbits first put it into pipes Not even the Wizards first thought of that before we did Though one Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago and became as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to The Shire was divided into four quarters the Farthings already referred to North South East and West and these again each into a number of folklands which still bore the names of some of the old leading families although by the time of this history these names were no longer found only in their proper folklands Nearly all Tooks still lived in the Tookland but that was not true of many other families such as the Bagginses or the Boffins Outside the Farthings were the East and West Marches the Buckland see beginning of Chapter V Book I and the Westmarch added to the Shire in SR 1462 The Shire at this time had hardly any government Families for the most part managed their own affairs Growing food and eating it occupied most of their time In other matters they were as a rule generous and not greedy but contented and moderate so that estates farms workshops and small trades tended to remain unchanged for generations There remained of course the ancient tradition concerning the high king at Fornost or Norbury as they called it away north of the Shire But there had been no king for nearly a thousand years and even the ruins of Kings Norbury were covered with grass Yet the Hobbits still said of wild folk and wicked things such as trolls that they had not heard of the king For they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws and usually they kept the laws of free will because they were The Rules as they said both ancient and just It is true that the Took family had long been preeminent for the office of Thain had passed to them from the Oldbucks some centuries before and the chief Took had borne that title ever since The Thain was the master of the Shiremoot and captain of the Shiremuster and the Hobbitryinarms but as muster and moot were only held in times of emergency which no longer occurred the Thainship had ceased to be more than a nominal dignity The Took family was still indeed accorded a special respect for it remained both numerous and exceedingly wealthy and was liable to produce in every generation strong characters of peculiar habits and even adventurous temperament The latter qualities however were now rather tolerated in the rich than generally approved The custom endured nonetheless of referring to the head of the family as The Took and of adding to his name if required a number such as Isengrim the Second for instance The only real official in the Shire at this date was the Mayor of Michel Delving or of the Shire who was elected every seven years at the Free Fair on the White Downs at the Lithe that is at Midsummer As mayor almost his only duty was to preside at banquets given on the Shireholidays which occurred at frequent intervals But the offices of Postmaster and First Shirriff were attached to the mayoralty so that he managed both the Messenger Service and the Watch These were the only Shireservices and the Messengers were the most numerous and much the busier of the two By no means all Hobbits were lettered but those who were wrote constantly to all their friends and a selection of their relations who lived further off than an afternoons walk The Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their police or the nearest equivalent that they possessed They had of course no uniforms such things being quite unknown only a feather in their caps and they were in practice rather haywards than policemen more concerned with the strayings of beasts than of people There were in all the Shire only twelve of them three in each Farthing for Inside Work A rather larger body varying at need was employed to beat the bounds and to see that Outsiders of any kind great or small did not make themselves a nuisance At the time when this story begins the Bounders as they were called had been greatly increased There were many reports and complaints of strange persons and creatures prowling about the borders or over them the first sign that all was not quite as it should be and always had been except in tales and legends of long ago Few heeded the sign and not even Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended Sixty years had passed since he set out on his memorable journey and he was old even for Hobbits who reached a hundred as often as not but much evidently still remained of the considerable wealth that he had brought back How much or how little he revealed to no one not even to Frodo his favourite nephew And he still kept secret the ring that he bad found As is told in The Hobbit there came one day to Bilbos door the great Wizard Gandalf the Grey and thirteen dwarves with him none other indeed than Thorin Oakenshield descendant of kings and his twelve companions in exile With them he set out to his own lasting astonishment on a morning of April it being then the year 1341 Shirereckoning on a quest of great treasure the dwarfhoards of the Kings under the Mountain beneath Erebor in Dale far off in the East The quest was successful and the Dragon that guarded the hoard was destroyed Yet though before all was won the Battle of Five Armies was fought and Thorin was slain and many deeds of renown were done the matter would scarcely have concerned later history or earned more than a note in the long annals of the Third Age but for an accident by the way The party was assailed by Orcs in a high pass of the Misty Mountains as they went towards Wilderland and so it happened that Bilbo was lost for a while in the black orcmines deep under the mountains and there as he groped in vain in the dark he put his hand on a ring lying on the floor of a tunnel He put it in his pocket It seemed then like mere luck Trying to find his way out Bilbo went on down to the roots of the mountains until he could go no further At the bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light and on an island of rock in the water lived Gollum He was a loathsome little creature he paddled a small boat with his large flat feet peering with pale luminous eyes and catching blind fish with his long fingers and eating them raw He ate any living thing even orc if he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle He possessed a secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago when he still lived in the light a ring of gold that made its wearer invisible It was the one thing he loved his precious and he talked to it even when it was not with him For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island except when he was hunting or spying on the ores of the mines Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once if the ring had been on him when they met but it was not and the hobbit held in his hand an Elvish knife which served him as a sword So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo to the Riddlegame saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo could not guess then he would kill him and eat him but if Bilbo defeated him then he would do as Bilbo wished he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels Since he was lost in the dark without hope and could neither go on nor back Bilbo accepted the challenge and they asked one another many riddles In the end Bilbo won the game more by luck as it seemed than by wits for he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask and cried out as his hand came upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten _What haw I got in my pocket_ This Gollum failed to answer though he demanded three guesses The Authorities it is true differ whether this last question was a mere question and not a riddle according to the strict rules of the Game but all agree that after accepting it and trying to guess the answer Gollum was bound by his promise And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word for the thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove false even though such promises were held sacred and of old all but the wickedest things feared to break them But after ages alone in the dark Gollums heart was black and treachery was in it He slipped away and returned to the island of which Bilbo knew nothing not far off in the dark water There he thought lay his ring He was hungry now and angry and once his precious was with him he would not fear any weapon at all But the ring was not on the island he had lost it it was gone His screech sent a shiver down Bilbos back though he did not yet understand what had happened But Gollum had at last leaped to a guess too late _What has it got in its pocketses_ he cried The light in his eyes was like a green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his precious Just in time Bilbo saw his peril and he fled blindly up the passage away from the water and once more he was saved by his luck For just as he ran he put his hand in his pocket and the ring slipped quietly on to his finger So it was that Gollum passed him without seeing him and went to guard the way out lest the thief should escape Warily Bilbo followed him as he went along cursing and talking to himself about his precious from which talk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth and hope came to him in the darkness he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of escape from the orcs and from Gollum At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the lower gates of the mines on the eastward side of the mountains There Gollum crouched at bay smelling and listening and Bilbo was tempted to slay him with his sword But pity stayed him and though he kept the ring in which his only hope lay he would not use it to help him kill the wretched creature at a disadvantage In the end gathering his courage he leaped over Gollum in the dark and fled away down the passage pursued by his enemys cries of hate and despair _Thief thief Baggins We hates it for ever_ Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told it to his companions To them his account was that Gollum had promised to give him a _present_ if he won the game but when Gollum went to fetch it from his island he found the treasure was gone a magic ring which had been given to him long ago on his birthday Bilbo guessed that this was the very ring that he had found and as he had won the game it was already his by right But being in a tight place he said nothing about it and made Gollum show him the way out as a reward instead of a present This account Bilbo set down in his memoirs and he seems never to have altered it himself not even after the Council of Elrond Evidently it still appeared in the original Red Book as it did in several of the copies and abstracts But many copies contain the true account as an alternative derived no doubt from notes by Frodo or Samwise both of whom learned the truth though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old hobbit himself Gandalf however disbelieved Bilbos first story as soon as he heard it and he continued to be very curious about the ring Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning which for a while strained their friendship but the wizard seemed to think the truth important Though he did not say so to Bilbo he also thought it important and disturbing to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the first quite contrary to his habit The idea of a present was not mere hobbitlike invention all the same It was suggested to Bilbo as he confessed by Gollums talk that he overheard for Gollum did in fact call the ring his birthday present many times That also Gandalf thought strange and suspicious but he did not discover the truth in this point for many more years as will be seen in this book Of Bilbos later adventures little more need be said here With the help of the ring he escaped from the orcguards at the gate and rejoined his companions He used the ring many times on his quest chiefly for the help of his friends but he kept it secret from them as long as he could After his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone save Gandalf and Frodo and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence or so he believed Only to Frodo did he show the account of his Journey that he was writing His sword Sting Bilbo hung over his fireplace and his coat of marvellous mail the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragonhoard he lent to a museum to the Michel Delving Mathomhouse in fact But he kept in a drawer at Bag End the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels and the ring secured by a fine chain remained in his pocket He returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in his fiftysecond year SR 1342 and nothing very notable occurred in the Shire until Mr Baggins began the preparations for the celebration of his hundredandeleventh birthday SR 1401 At this point this History begins At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great events that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the Reunited Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history and many of their traditions up to that time still mainly oral were collected and Written down The greater families were also concerned with events in the Kingdom at large and many of their members studied its ancient histories and legends By the end of the first century of the Fourth Age there were already to be found in the Shire several libraries that contained many historical books and records The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers at Great Smials and at Brandy Hall This account of the end of the Third Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch That most important source for the history of the War of the Ring was so called because it was long preserved at Undertowers the home of the Fairbairns Wardens of the Westmarch It was in origin Bilbos private diary which he took with him to Rivendell Frodo brought it back to the Shire together with many loose leaves of notes and during SR 14201 he nearly filled its pages with his account of the War But annexed to it and preserved with it probably m a single red case were the three large volumes bound in red leather that Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift To these four volumes there was added in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries genealogies and various other matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship The original Red Book has not been preserved but many copies were made especially of the first volume for the use of the descendants of the children of Master Samwise The most important copy however has a different history It was kept at Great Smials but it was written in Condor probably at the request of the greatgrandson of Peregrin and completed in SR 1592 FA 172 Its southern scribe appended this note Findegil Kings Writer finished this work in IV 172 It is an exact copy in all details of the Thains Book m Minas Tirith That book was a copy made at the request of King Elessar of the Red Book of the Periannath and was brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64 The Thains Book was thus the first copy made of the Red Book and contained much that was later omitted or lost In Minas Tirith it received much annotation and many corrections especially of names words and quotations in the Elvish languages and there was added to it an abbreviated version of those parts of _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_ which lie outside the account of the War The full tale is stated to have been written by Barahir grandson of the Steward Faramir some time after the passing of the King But the chief importance of Findegils copy is that it alone contains the whole of Bilbos Translations from the Elvish These three volumes were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which between 1403 and 1418 he had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell both living and written But since they were little used by Frodo being almost entirely concerned with the Elder Days no more is said of them here Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their great families and at the same time kept up their connexions with Rohan and Gondor the libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the Red Book In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with Eriador and the history of Rohan Some of these were composed or begun by Meriadoc himself though in the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his _Herblore of the Shire_ and for his _Reckoning of Years_ m which he discussed the relation of the calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell Gondor and Rohan He also wrote a short treatise on _Old Words and Names in the Shire_ having special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the Rohirrim of such shirewords as _mathom_ and old elements in place names At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shirefolk though more important for larger history None of them was written by Peregrin but he and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of Gondor mainly copies or summaries of histories or legends relating to Elendil and his heirs Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive materials for the history of Nmenor and the arising of Sauron It was probably at Great Smials that _The Tale of Years_ was put together with the assistance of material collected by Meriadoc Though the dates given are often conjectural especially for the Second Age they deserve attention It is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and information from Rivendell which he visited more than once There though Elrond had departed his sons long remained together with some of the Highelven folk It is said that Celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of Galadriel but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the Grey Havens and with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middleearth THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING _being the first part of The Lord of the Rings_ BOOK I _Chapter 1_ A Longexpected Party When Mr Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventyfirst birthday with a party of special magnificence there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend and it was popularly believed whatever the old folk might say that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure And if that was not enough for fame there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at Time wore on but it seemed to have little effect on Mr Baggins At ninety he was much the same as at fifty At ninetynine they began to call him _well_preserved but _unchanged_ would have been nearer the mark There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing it seemed unfair that anyone should possess apparently perpetual youth as well as reputedly inexhaustible wealth It will have to be paid for they said It isnt natural and trouble will come of it But so far trouble had not come and as Mr Baggins was generous with his money most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune He remained on visiting terms with his relatives except of course the SackvilleBagginses and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families But he had no close friends until some of his younger cousins began to grow up The eldest of these and Bilbos favourite was young Frodo Baggins When Bilbo was ninetynine he adopted Frodo as his heir and brought him to live at Bag End and the hopes of the SackvilleBagginses were finally dashed Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday September 22nd You had better come and live here Frodo my lad said Bilbo one day and then we can celebrate our birthdayparties comfortably together At that time Frodo was still in his _tweens_ as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirtythree Twelve more years passed Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthdayparties at Bag End but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn Bilbo was going to be _eleventyone_ 111 a rather curious number and a very respectable age for a hobbit the Old Took himself had only reached 130 and Frodo was going to be _thirtythree_ 33 an important number the date of his coming of age Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire The history and character of Mr Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee commonly known as the Gaffer He held forth at _The Ivy Bush_ a small inn on the Bywater road and he spoke with some authority for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years and had helped old Holman in the same job before that Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son Sam Gamgee Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo They lived on the Hill itself in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End A very nice wellspoken gentlehobbit is Mr Bilbo as Ive always said the Gaffer declared With perfect truth for Bilbo was very polite to him calling him Master Hamfast and consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables in the matter of roots especially potatoes the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood including himself But what about this Frodo that lives with him asked Old Noakes of Bywater Baggins is his name but hes more than half a Brandybuck they say It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland where folks are so queer And no wonder theyre queer put in Daddy Twofoot the Gaffers nextdoor neighbour if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River and right agin the Old Forest Thats a dark bad place if half the tales be true Youre right Dad said the Gaffer Not that the Brandybucks of Buckland live _in_ the Old Forest but theyre a queer breed seemingly They fool about with boats on that big river and that isnt natural Small wonder that trouble came of it I say But be that as it may Mr Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet Very much like Mr Bilbo and in more than looks After all his father was a Baggins A decent respectable hobbit was Mr Drogo Baggins there was never much to tell of him till he was drownded Drownded said several voices They had heard this and other darker rumours before of course but hobbits have a passion for family history and they were ready to hear it again Well so they say said the Gaffer You see Mr Drogo he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck She was our Mr Bilbos first cousin on the mothers side her mother being the youngest of the Old Tooks daughters and Mr Drogo was his second cousin So Mr Frodo is his first _and_ second cousin once removed either way as the saying is if you follow me And Mr Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his fatherinlaw old Master Gorbadoc as he often did after his marriage him being partial to his vittles and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table and he went out _boating_on the Brandywine River and he and his wife were drownded and poor Mr Frodo only a child and all Ive heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight said Old Noakes and it was Drogos weight as sunk the boat And _I_ heard she pushed him in and he pulled her in after him said Sandyman the Hobbiton miller You shouldnt listen to all you hear Sandyman said the Gaffer who did not much like the miller There isnt no call to go talking of pushing and pulling Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble Anyway there was this Mr Frodo left an orphan and stranded as you might say among those queer Bucklanders being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall A regular warren by all accounts Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place Mr Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those SackvilleBagginses They thought they were going to get Bag End that time when he went off and was thought to be dead And then he comes back and orders them off and he goes on living and living and never looking a day older bless him And suddenly he produces an heir and has all the papers made out proper The SackvilleBagginses wont never see the inside of Bag End now or it is to be hoped not Theres a tidy bit of money tucked away up there I hear tell said a stranger a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver _and_jools by what Ive heard Then youve heard more than I can speak to answered the Gaffer I know nothing about _jools_ Mr Bilbo is free with his money and there seems no lack of it but I know of no tunnelmaking I saw Mr Bilbo when he came back a matter of sixty years ago when I was a lad Id not long come prentice to old Holman him being my dads cousin but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on And in the middle of it all Mr Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests I dont doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts where there be mountains of gold they say but there wasnt enough to fill tunnels But my lad Sam will know more about that Hes in and out of Bag End Crazy about stories of the old days he is and he listens to all Mr Bilbos tales Mr Bilbo has learned him his letters meaning no harm mark you and I hope no harm will come of it _Elves and Dragons_ I says to him _Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you Dont go getting mixed up in the business of your betters or youll land in trouble too big for you_I says to him And I might say it to others he added with a look at the stranger and the miller But the Gaffer did not convince his audience The legend of Bilbos wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits Ah but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first argued the miller voicing common opinion Hes often away from home And look at the outlandish folk that visit him dwarves coming at night and that old wandering conjuror Gandalf and all You can say what you like Gaffer but Bag Ends a queer place and its folk are queerer And you can say _what you_ like about what you know no more of than you do of boating Mr Sandyman retorted the Gaffer disliking the miller even more than usual If thats being queer then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts Theres some not far away that wouldnt offer a pint of beer to a friend if they lived in a hole with golden walls But they do things proper at Bag End Our Sam says that _everyones_ going to be invited to the party and theres going to be presents mark you presents for all this very month as is That very month was September and as fine as you could ask A day or two later a rumour probably started by the knowledgeable Sam was spread about that there were going to be fireworks fireworks what is more such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century not indeed since the Old Took died Days passed and The Day drew nearer An oddlooking waggon laden with oddlooking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it It was driven by outlandish folk singing strange songs dwarves with long beards and deep hoods A few of them remained at Bag End At the end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of the Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight An old man was driving it all alone He wore a tall pointed blue hat a long grey cloak and a silver scarf He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat Small hobbitchildren ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right up the hill It had a cargo of fireworks as they rightly guessed At Bilbos front door the old man began to unload there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes each labelled with a large red G and the elfrune That was Gandalfs mark of course and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires smokes and lights His real business was far more difficult and dangerous but the Shirefolk knew nothing about it To them he was just one of the attractions at the Party Hence the excitement of the hobbitchildren G for Grand they shouted and the old man smiled They knew him by sight though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays they now belonged to the legendary past When the old man helped by Bilbo and some dwarves had finished unloading Bilbo gave a few pennies away but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming to the disappointment of the onlookers Run away now said Gandalf You will get plenty when the time comes Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo and the door was shut The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while and then made off feeling that the day of the party would never come Inside Bag End Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden The late afternoon was bright and peaceful The flowers glowed red and golden snapdragons and sunflowers and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows How bright your garden looks said Gandalf Yes said Bilbo I am very fond indeed of it and of all the dear old Shire but I think I need a holiday You mean to go on with your plan then I do I made up my mind months ago and I havent changed it Very well It is no good saying any more Stick to your plan your whole plan mind and I hope it will turn out for the best for you and for all of us I hope so Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday and have my little joke Who will laugh I wonder said Gandalf shaking his head We shall see said Bilbo The next day more carts rolled up the Hill and still more carts There might have been some grumbling about dealing locally but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision commodity or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood People became enthusiastic and they began to tick off the days on the calendar and they watched eagerly for the postman hoping for invitations Before long the invitations began pouring out and the Hobbiton postoffice was blocked and the Bywater postoffice was snowed under and voluntary assistant postmen were called for There was a constant stream of them going up the Hill carrying hundreds of polite variations on _Thank you I shall certainly come_ A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS Even those who had or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside Bilbo was busy writing invitations ticking off answers packing up presents and making some private preparations of his own From the time of Gandalfs arrival he remained hidden from view One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field south of Bilbos front door covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road and wide steps and a large white gate were built there The three hobbitfamilies of Bagshot Row adjoining the field were intensely interested and generally envied Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden The tents began to go up There was a specially large pavilion so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it and stood proudly near one end at the head of the chief table Lanterns were hung on all its branches More promising still to the hobbits mind an enormous openair kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field A draught of cooks from every inn and eatinghouse for miles around arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End Excitement rose to its height Then the weather clouded over That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party Anxiety was intense Then Thursday September the 22nd actually dawned The sun got up the clouds vanished flags were unfurled and the fun began Bilbo Baggins called it a _party_ but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one Practically everybody living near was invited A very few were overlooked by accident but as they turned up all the same that did not matter Many people from other parts of the Shire were also asked and there were even a few from outside the borders Bilbo met the guests and additions at the new white gate in person He gave away presents to all and sundry the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays Not very expensive ones as a rule and not so lavishly as on this occasion but it was not a bad system Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year it was somebodys birthday so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week But they never got tired of them On this occasion the presents were unusually good The hobbitchildren were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating There were toys the like of which they had never seen before all beautiful and some obviously magical Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale and were of real dwarfmake When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate there were songs dances music games and of course food and drink There were three official meals lunch tea and dinner or supper But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together At other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking continuously from elevenses until sixthirty when the fireworks started The fireworks were by Gandalf they were not only brought by him but designed and made by him and the special effects set pieces and flights of rockets were let off by him But there was also a generous distribution of squibs crackers backarappers sparklers torches dwarfcandles elffountains goblinbarkers and thunderclaps They were all superb The art of Gandalf improved with age There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles or sailing ships or a phalanx of flying swans there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army and came down again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes And there was also one last surprise in honour of Bilbo and it startled the hobbits exceedingly as Gandalf intended The lights went out A great smoke went up It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance and began to glow at the summit It spouted green and scarlet flames Out flew a redgolden dragon not lifesize but terribly lifelike fire came from his jaws his eyes glared down there was a roar and he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd They all ducked and many fell flat on their faces The dragon passed like an express train turned a somersault and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion That is the signal for supper said Bilbo The pain and alarm vanished at once and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet There was a splendid supper for everyone for everyone that is except those invited to the special family dinnerparty This was held in the great pavilion with the tree The invitations were limited to twelve dozen a number also called by the hobbits one Gross though the word was not considered proper to use of people and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related with the addition of a few special unrelated friends such as Gandalf Many young hobbits were included and present by parental permission for hobbits were easygoing with their children in the matter of sitting up late especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender There were many Bagginses and Boffins and also many Tooks and Brandybucks there were various Grubbs relations of Bilbo Baggins grandmother and various Chubbs connexions of his Took grandfather and a selection of Burrowses Bolgers Bracegirdles Brockhouses Goodbodies Hornblowers and Proudfoots Some of these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo and some of them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before as they lived in remote corners of the Shire The SackvilleBagginses were not forgotten Otho and his wife Lobelia were present They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo but so magnificent was the invitation card written in golden ink that they had felt it was impossible to refuse Besides their cousin Bilbo had been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high reputation All the one hundred and fortyfour guests expected a pleasant feast though they rather dreaded the afterdinner speech of their host an inevitable item He was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry and sometimes after a glass or two would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey The guests were not disappointed they had a _very_ pleasant feast in fact an engrossing entertainment rich abundant varied and prolonged The purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks but as Bilbos catering had depleted the stocks of most stores cellars and warehouses for miles around that did not matter much After the feast more or less came the Speech Most of the company were however now in a tolerant mood at that delightful stage which they called filling up the corners They were sipping their favourite drinks and nibbling at their favourite dainties and their fears were forgotten They were prepared to listen to anything and to cheer at every full stop _My dear People_ began Bilbo rising in his place Hear Hear Hear they shouted and kept on repeating it in chorus seeming reluctant to follow their own advice Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated tree The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat They could all see him standing waving one hand in the air the other was in his trouserpocket _My dear Bagginses and Boffins_ he began again _and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks and Grubbs and Chubbs and Burrowses and Hornblowers and Bolgers Bracegirdles Goodbodies Brockhouses and Proudfoots_ ProudFEET shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion His name of course was Proudfoot and well merited his feet were large exceptionally furry and both were on the table _Proudfoots_ repeated Bilbo _Also my good SackvilleBagginses that I welcome back at last to Bag End Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday I am eleventyone today_ Hurray Hurray Many Happy Returns they shouted and they hammered joyously on the tables Bilbo was doing splendidly This was the sort of stuff they liked short and obvious _I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am_ Deafening cheers Cries of _Yes_ and _No_ Noises of trumpets and horns pipes and flutes and other musical instruments There were as has been said many young hobbits present Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled Most of them bore the mark DALE on them which did not convey much to most of the hobbits but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers They contained instruments small but of perfect make and enchanting tones Indeed in one corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finished since he had plainly said all that was necessary now got up an impromptu orchestra and began a merry dancetune Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the Springlering a pretty dance but rather vigorous But Bilbo had not finished Seizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew three loud hoots The noise subsided _I shall not keep you long_ he cried Cheers from all the assembly _I have called you all together for a Purpose_ Something in the way that he said this made an impression There was almost silence and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears _Indeed for Three Purposes First of all to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all and that eleventyone years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits_ Tremendous outburst of approval _I dont know half of you half as well as I should like and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve_ This was unexpected and rather difficult There was some scattered clapping but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment _Secondly to celebrate my birthday_ Cheers again _I should say OUR birthday For it is of course also the birthday of my heir and nephew Frodo He comes of age and into his inheritance today_ Some perfunctory clapping by the elders and some loud shouts of Frodo Frodo Jolly old Frodo from the juniors The SackvilleBagginses scowled and wondered what was meant by coming into his inheritance _Together we score one hundred and fortyfour Your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total One Gross if I may use the expression_ No cheers This was ridiculous Many of his guests and especially the SackvilleBagginses were insulted feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number like goods in a package One Gross indeed Vulgar expression _It is also if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history the anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake though the fact that it was_ my _birthday slipped my memory on that occasion I was only fiftyone then and birthdays did not seem so important The banquet was very splendid however though I had a bad cold at the time I remember and could only say thag you very buch I now repeat it more correctly Thank you very much for coming to my little party_ Obstinate silence They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent and they were getting bored Why couldnt he stop talking and let them drink his health But Bilbo did not sing or recite He paused for a moment _Thirdly and finally_ he said _I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT_ He spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could _I regret to announce that though as I said eleventyone years is far too short a time to spend among you this is the END I am going I am leaving NOW GOODBYE_ He stepped down and vanished There was a blinding flash of light and the guests all blinked When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen One hundred and fortyfour flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped Then there was a dead silence until suddenly after several deep breaths every Baggins Boffin Took Brandybuck Grubb Chubb Burrows Bolger Bracegirdle Brockhouse Goodbody Hornblower and Proudfoot began to talk at once It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance Hes mad I always said so was probably the most popular comment Even the Tooks with a few exceptions thought Bilbos behaviour was absurd For the moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits and he said to his daughterinlaw Esmeralda Theres something fishy in this my dear I believe that mad Baggins is off again Silly old fool But why worry He hasnt taken the vittles with him He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing For some time he had sat silent beside Bilbos empty chair and ignored all remarks and questions He had enjoyed the joke of course even though he had been in the know He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests But at the same time he felt deeply troubled he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins oddities past and present but the SackvilleBagginses had already departed in wrath Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party He gave orders for more wine to be served then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo and slipped out of the pavilion As for Bilbo Baggins even while he was making his speech he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again He walked briskly back to his hole and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field Then he went in He took off his party clothes folded up and wrapped in tissuepaper his embroidered silk waistcoat and put it away Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt On it he hung a short sword in a battered blackleather scabbard From a locked drawer smelling of mothballs he took out an old cloak and hood They had been locked up as if they were very precious but they were so patched and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed it might have been dark green They were rather too large for him He then went into his study and from a large strongbox took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths and a leatherbound manuscript and also a large bulky envelope The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there already nearly full Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring and its fine chain and then sealed it and addressed it to Frodo At first he put it on the mantelpiece but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in Hullo said Bilbo I wondered if you would turn up I am glad to find you visible replied the wizard sitting down in a chair I wanted to catch you and have a few final words I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan Yes I do said Bilbo Though that flash was surprising it quite startled me let alone the others A little addition of your own I suppose It was You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment And would spoil my joke You are an interfering old busybody laughed Bilbo but I expect you know best as usual I do when I know anything But I dont feel too sure about this whole affair It has now come to the final point You have had your joke and alarmed or offended most of your relations and given the whole Shire something to talk about for nine days or ninetynine more likely Are you going any further Yes I am I feel I need a holiday a very long holiday as I have told you before Probably a permanent holiday I dont expect I shall return In fact I dont mean to and I have made all arrangements I am old Gandalf I dont look it but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts _Wellpreserved_ indeed he snorted Why I feel all thin sort of _stretched_ if you know what I mean like butter that has been scraped over too much bread That cant be right I need a change or something Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him No it does not seem right he said thoughtfully No after all I believe your plan is probably the best Well Ive made up my mind anyway I want to see mountains again Gandalf _mountains_ and then find somewhere where I can _rest_ In peace and quiet without a lot of relatives prying around and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell I might find somewhere where I can finish my book I have thought of a nice ending for it _and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days _ Gandalf laughed I hope he will But nobody will read the book however it ends Oh they may in years to come Frodo has read some already as far as it has gone Youll keep an eye on Frodo wont you Yes I will two eyes as often as I can spare them He would come with me of course if I asked him In fact he offered to once just before the party But he does not really want to yet I want to see the wild country again before I die and the Mountains but he is still in love with the Shire with woods and fields and little rivers He ought to be comfortable here I am leaving everything to him of course except a few oddments I hope he will be happy when he gets used to being on his own Its time he was his own master now Everything said Gandalf The ring as well You agreed to that you remember Well er yes I suppose so stammered Bilbo Where is it In an envelope if you must know said Bilbo impatiently There on the mantelpiece Well no Here it is in my pocket He hesitated Isnt that odd now he said softly to himself Yet after all why not Why shouldnt it stay there Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo and there was a gleam in his eyes I think Bilbo he said quietly I should leave it behind Dont you want to Well yes and no Now it comes to it I dont like parting with it at all I may say And I dont really see why I should Why do you want me to he asked and a curious change came over his voice It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance You are always badgering me about my ring but you have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey No but I had to badger you said Gandalf I wanted the truth It was important Magic rings are well magical and they are rare and curious I was professionally interested in your ring you may say and I still am I should like to know where it is if you go wandering again Also I think _you_have had it quite long enough You wont need it any more Bilbo unless I am quite mistaken Bilbo flushed and there was an angry light in his eyes His kindly face grew hard Why not he cried And what business is it of yours anyway to know what I do with my own things It is my own I found it It came to me Yes yes said Gandalf But there is no need to get angry If I am it is your fault said Bilbo It is mine I tell you My own My precious Yes my precious The wizards face remained grave and attentive and only a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed It has been called that before he said but not by you But I say it now And why not Even if Gollum said the same once Its not his now but mine And I shall keep it I say Gandalf stood up He spoke sternly You will be a fool if you do Bilbo he said You make that clearer with every word you say It has got far too much hold on you Let it go And then you can go yourself and be free Ill do as I choose and go as I please said Bilbo obstinately Now now my dear hobbit said Gandalf All your long life we have been friends and you owe me something Come Do as you promised give it up Well if you want my ring yourself say so cried Bilbo But you wont get it I wont give my precious away I tell you His hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword Gandalfs eyes flashed It will be my turn to get angry soon he said If you say that again I shall Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked He took a step towards the hobbit and he seemed to grow tall and menacing his shadow filled the little room Bilbo backed away to the wall breathing hard his hand clutching at his pocket They stood for a while facing one another and the air of the room tingled Gandalfs eyes remained bent on the hobbit Slowly his hands relaxed and he began to tremble I dont know what has come over you Gandalf he said You have never been like this before What is it all about It is mine isnt it I found it and Gollum would have killed me if I hadnt kept it Im not a thief whatever he said I have never called you one Gandalf answered And I am not one either I am not trying to rob you but to help you I wish you would trust me as you used He turned away and the shadow passed He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man bent and troubled Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes I am sorry he said But I felt so queer And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more It has been so growing on my mind lately Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me And I am always wanting to put it on and disappear dont you know or wondering if it is safe and pulling it out to make sure I tried locking it up but I found I couldnt rest without it in my pocket I dont know why And I dont seem able to make up my mind Then trust mine said Gandalf It is quite made up Go away and leave it behind Stop possessing it Give it to Frodo and I will look after him Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided Presently he sighed All right he said with an effort I will Then he shrugged his shoulders and smiled rather ruefully After all thats what this party business was all about really to give away lots of birthday presents and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same time It hasnt made it any easier in the end but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations It would quite spoil the joke Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair said Gandalf Very well said Bilbo it goes to Frodo with all the rest He drew a deep breath And now I really must be starting or somebody else will catch me I have said goodbye and I couldnt bear to do it all over again He picked up his bag and moved to the door You have still got the ring in your pocket said the wizard Well so I have cried Bilbo And my will and all the other documents too You had better take it and deliver it for me That will be safest No dont give the ring to me said Gandalf Put it on the mantelpiece It will be safe enough there till Frodo comes I shall wait for him Bilbo took out the envelope but just as he was about to set it by the clock his hand jerked back and the packet fell on the floor Before he could pick it up the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbits face again Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh Well thats that he said Now Im off They went out into the hall Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand then he whistled Three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy Is everything ready asked Bilbo Everything packed and labelled Everything they answered Well lets start then He stepped out of the frontdoor It was a fine night and the black sky was dotted with stars He looked up sniffing the air What fun What fun to be off again off on the Road with dwarves This is what I have really been longing for for years Goodbye he said looking at his old home and bowing to the door Goodbye Gandalf Goodbye for the present Bilbo Take care of yourself You are old enough and perhaps wise enough Take care I dont care Dont you worry about me I am as happy now as I have ever been and that is saying a great deal But the time has come I am being swept off my feet at last he added and then in a low voice as if to himself he sang softly in the dark The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began Now far ahead the Road has gone And I must follow if I can Pursuing it with eager feet Until it joins some larger way Where many paths and errands meet And whither then I cannot say He paused silent for a moment Then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents and followed by his three companions went round into his garden and trotted down the long sloping path He jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the meadows passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness Goodbye my dear Bilbo until our next meeting he said softly and went back indoors Frodo came in soon afterwards and found him sitting in the dark deep in thought Has he gone he asked Yes answered Gandalf he has gone at last I wish I mean I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke said Frodo But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go He always used to joke about serious things I wish I had come back sooner just to see him off I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end said Gandalf Dont be too troubled Hell be all right now He left a packet for you There it is Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece and glanced at it but did not open it Youll find his will and all the other documents in there I think said the wizard You are the master of Bag End now And also I fancy youll find a golden ring The ring exclaimed Frodo Has he left me that I wonder why Still it may be useful It may and it may not said Gandalf I should not make use of it if I were you But keep it secret and keep it safe Now I am going to bed As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say goodbye to the guests Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field but Frodo would only say _no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning_ About midnight carriages came for the important folk One by one they rolled away filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits Gardeners came by arrangement and removed in wheelbarrows those that had inadvertently remained behind Night slowly passed The sun rose The hobbits rose rather later Morning went on People came and began by orders to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates and the lanterns and the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and crackerpaper the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs and the uneaten food a very small item Then a number of other people came without orders Bagginses and Boffins and Bolgers and Tooks and other guests that lived or were staying near By midday when even the bestfed were out and about again there was a large crowd at Bag End uninvited but not unexpected Frodo was waiting on the step smiling but looking rather tired and worried He welcomed all the callers but he had not much more to say than before His reply to all inquiries was simply this Mr Bilbo Baggins has gone away as far as I know for good Some of the visitors he invited to come inside as Bilbo had left messages for them Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture On every item there was a label tied There were several labels of this sort _For ADELARD TOOK for his VERY OWN from Bilbo_ on an umbrella Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones _For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence with love from Bilbo_ on a large wastepaper basket Dora was Drogos sister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo she was ninetynine and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century _For MILO BURROWS hoping it will be useful from BB_ on a gold pen and inkbottle Milo never answered letters _For ANGELICAS use from Uncle Bilbo_ on a round convex mirror She was a young Baggins and too obviously considered her face shapely _For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE from a contributor_ on an empty bookcase Hugo was a great borrower of books and worse than usual at returning them _For LOBELIA SACKVILLEBAGGINS as a PRESENT_ on a case of silver spoons Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons while he was away on his former journey Lobelia knew that quite well When she arrived later in the day she took the point at once but she also took the spoons This is only a small selection of the assembled presents Bilbos residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long life It was a tendency of hobbitholes to get cluttered up for which the custom of giving so many birthdaypresents was largely responsible Not of course that the birthdaypresents were always _new_ there were one or two old _mathoms_ of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district but Bilbo had usually given new presents and kept those that he received The old hole was now being cleared a little Every one of the various parting gifts had labels written out personally by Bilbo and several had some point or some joke But of course most of the things were given where they would be wanted and welcome The poorer hobbits and especially those of Bagshot Row did very well Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes a new spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints Old Rory Brandybuck in return for much hospitality got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards a strong red wine from the Southfarthing and now quite mature as it had been laid down by Bilbos father Rory quite forgave Bilbo and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle There was plenty of everything left for Frodo And of course all the chief treasures as well as the books pictures and more than enough furniture were left in his possession There was however no sign nor mention of money or jewellery not a pennypiece or a glass bead was given away Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon A false rumour that the whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there but could not be kept out Labels got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke out Some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall and others tried to make _off_ with minor items not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts In the middle of the commotion the SackvilleBagginses arrived Frodo had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo Merry bowed politely He is indisposed he said He is resting Hiding you mean said Lobelia Anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him Just go and tell him so Merry left them a long while in the hall and they had time to discover their parting gift of spoons It did not improve their tempers Eventually they were shown into the study Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him He looked indisposed to see SackvilleBagginses at any rate and he stood up fidgeting with something in his pocket But he spoke quite politely The SackvilleBagginses were rather offensive They began by offering him bad bargainprices as between friends for various valuable and unlabelled things When Frodo replied that only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away they said the whole affair was very fishy Only one thing is clear to me said Otho and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it I insist on seeing the will Otho would have been Bilbos heir but for the adoption of Frodo He read the will carefully and snorted It was unfortunately very clear and correct according to the legal customs of hobbits which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink Foiled again he said to his wife And after waiting _sixty_ years Spoons Fiddlesticks He snapped his fingers under Frodos nose and slumped off But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of A little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the place investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors He escorted her firmly off the premises after he had relieved her of several small but rather valuable articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella Her face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark but all she found to say turning round on the step was Youll live to regret it young fellow Why didnt you go too You dont belong here youre no Baggins you youre a Brandybuck Did you hear that Merry That was an insult if you like said Frodo as he shut the door on her It was a compliment said Merry Brandybuck and so of course not true Then they went round the hole and evicted three young hobbits two Boffins and a Bolger who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot old Odo Proudfoots grandson who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry where he thought there was an echo The legend of Bilbos gold excited both curiosity and hope for legendary gold mysteriously obtained if not positively illgotten is as every one knows any ones for the finding unless the search is interrupted When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall Its time to close the shop Merry he said Lock the door and dont open it to anyone today not even if they bring a battering ram Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea He had hardly sat down when there came a soft knock at the frontdoor Lobelia again most likely he thought She must have thought of something really nasty and have come back again to say it It can wait He went on with his tea The knock was repeated much louder but he took no notice Suddenly the wizards head appeared at the window If you dont let me in Frodo I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill he said My dear Gandalf Half a minute cried Frodo running out of the room to the door Come in Come in I thought it was Lobelia Then I forgive you But I saw her some time ago driving a ponytrap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk She had already nearly curdled me Honestly I nearly tried on Bilbos ring I longed to disappear Dont do that said Gandalf sitting down Do be careful of that ring Frodo In fact it is partly about that that I have come to say a last word Well what about it What do you know already Only what Bilbo told me I have heard his story how he found it and how he used it on his journey I mean Which story I wonder said Gandalf Oh not what he told the dwarves and put in his book said Frodo He told me the true story soon after I came to live here He said you had pestered him till he told you so I had better know too No secrets between us Frodo he said but they are not to go any further Its mine anyway Thats interesting said Gandalf Well what did you think of it all If you mean inventing all that about a present well I thought the true story much more likely and I couldnt see the point of altering it at all It was very unlike Bilbo to do so anyway and I thought it rather odd So did I But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures if they use them Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to I dont understand said Frodo Neither do I answered the wizard I have merely begun to wonder about the ring especially since last night No need to worry But if you take my advice you will use it very seldom or not at all At least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion I say again keep it safe and keep it secret You are very mysterious What are you afraid of I am not certain so I will say no more I may be able to tell you something when I come back I am going off at once so this is goodbye for the present He got up At once cried Frodo Why I thought you were staying on for at least a week I was looking forward to your help I did mean to but I have had to change my mind I may be away for a good while but Ill come and see you again as soon as I can Expect me when you see me I shall slip in quietly I shant often be visiting the Shire openly again I find that I have become rather unpopular They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace Some people are actually accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away or worse If you want to know there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth Some people exclaimed Frodo You mean Otho and Lobelia How abominable I would give them Bag End and everything else if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him I love the Shire But I begin to wish somehow that I had gone too I wonder if I shall ever see him again So do I said Gandalf And I wonder many other things Goodbye now Take care of yourself Look out for me especially at unlikely times Goodbye Frodo saw him to the door He gave a final wave of his hand and walked off at a surprising pace but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a great weight The evening was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight Frodo did not see him again for a long time _Chapter 2_ The Shadow of the Past The talk did not die down in nine or even ninetynine days The second disappearance of Mr Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton and indeed all over the Shire for a year and a day and was remembered much longer than that It became a firesidestory for young hobbits and eventually Mad Baggins who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgotten But in the meantime the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that Bilbo who had always been rather cracked had at last gone quite mad and had run off into the Blue There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone perhaps hell settle down and grow some hobbitsense they said And to all appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone and he did settle down but the growth of hobbitsense was not very noticeable Indeed he at once began to carry on Bilbos reputation for oddity He refused to go into mourning and the next year he gave a party in honour of Bilbos hundredandtwelfth birthday which he called Hundredweight Feast But that was short of the mark for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and rained drink as hobbits say Some people were rather shocked but Frodo kept up the custom of giving Bilbos Birthday Party year after year until they got used to it He said that he did not think Bilbo was dead When they asked Where is he then he shrugged his shoulders He lived alone as Bilbo had done but he had a good many friends especially among the younger hobbits mostly descendants of the Old Took who had as children been fond of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these but his closest friends were Peregrin Took usually called Pippin and Merry Brandybuck his real name was Meriadoc but that was seldom remembered Frodo went tramping all over the Shire with them but more often he wandered by himself and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight Merry and Pippin suspected that he visited the Elves at times as Bilbo had done As time went on people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good preservation outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens Some folk have all the luck they said but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer Frodo himself after the first shock found that being his own master and _the_ Mr Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant For some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the future But half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing He found himself wondering at times especially in the autumn about the wild lands and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams He began to say to himself Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day To which the other half of his mind always replied Not yet So it went on until his forties were running out and his fiftieth birthday was drawing near fifty was a number that he felt was somehow significant or ominous it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo Frodo began to feel restless and the old paths seemed too welltrodden He looked at maps and wondered what lay beyond their edges maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself and Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously Often he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years Frodo gathered all the news he could Elves who seldom walked in the Shire could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening passing and not returning but they were leaving Middleearth and were no longer concerned with its troubles There were however dwarves on the road in unusual numbers The ancient EastWest Road ran through the Shire to its end at the Grey Havens and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the Blue Mountains They were the hobbits chief source of news from distant parts if they wanted any as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries seeking refuge in the West They were troubled and some spoke in whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past like a shadow in the background of their memories but it was ominous and disquieting It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of Mordor The Dark Tower had been rebuilt it was said From there the power was spreading far and wide and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains Trolls were abroad no longer dullwitted but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons And there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these but they had no name Little of all this of course reached the ears of ordinary hobbits But even the deafest and most stayathome began to hear queer tales and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things The conversation in _The Green Dragon_ at Bywater one evening in the spring of Frodos fiftieth year showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Shire rumours had been heard though most hobbits still laughed at them Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire and opposite him was Ted Sandyman the millers son and there were various other rustic hobbits listening to their talk Queer things you do hear these days to be sure said Sam Ah said Ted you do if you listen But I can hear firesidetales and childrens stories at home if I want to No doubt you can retorted Sam and I daresay theres more truth in some of them than you reckon Who invented the stories anyway Take dragons now No thank ee said Ted I wont I heard tell of them when I was a youngster but theres no call to believe in them now Theres only one Dragon in Bywater and thats Green he said getting a general laugh All right said Sam laughing with the rest But what about these Treemen these giants as you might call them They do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back Whos _they_ My cousin Hal for one He works for Mr Boffin at Overhill and goes up to the Northfarthing for the hunting He _saw_ one Says he did perhaps Your Hals always saying hes seen things and maybe he sees things that aint there But this one was as big as an elm tree and walking walking seven yards to a stride if it was an inch Then I bet it wasnt an inch What he saw _was_ an elm tree as like as not But this one was _walking_ I tell you and there aint no elm tree on the North Moors Then Hal cant have seen one said Ted There was some laughing and clapping the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point All the same said Sam you cant deny that others besides our Halfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire crossing it mind you there are more that are turned back at the borders The Bounders have never been so busy before And Ive heard tell that Elves are moving west They do say they are going to the harbours out away beyond the White Towers Sam waved his arm vaguely neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the Sea past the old towers beyond the western borders of the Shire But it was an old tradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens from which at times elvenships set sail never to return They are sailing sailing sailing over the Sea they are going into the West and leaving us said Sam half chanting the words shaking his head sadly and solemnly But Ted laughed Well that isnt anything new if you believe the old tales And I dont see what it matters to me or you Let them sail But I warrant you havent seen them doing it nor any one else in the Shire Well I dont know said Sam thoughtfully He believed he had once seen an Elf in the woods and still hoped to see more one day Of all the legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and halfremembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits knew had always moved him most deeply There are some even in these parts as know the Fair Folk and get news of them he said Theres Mr Baggins now that I work for He told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves And old Mr Bilbo knew more manys the talk I had with him when I was a little lad Oh theyre both cracked said Ted Leastways old Bilbo was cracked and Frodos cracking If thats where you get your news from youll never want for moonshine Well friends Im off home Your good health He drained his mug and went out noisily Sam sat silent and said no more He had a good deal to think about For one thing there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden and he would have a busy day tomorrow if the weather cleared The grass was growing fast But Sam had more on his mind than gardening After a while he sighed and got up and went out It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain The sun was down and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night He walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill whistling softly and thoughtfully It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence For three years after the Party he had been away Then he paid Frodo a brief visit and after taking a good look at him he went off again During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often coming unexpectedly after dusk and going off without warning before sunrise He would not discuss his own business and journeys and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodos health and doings Then suddenly his visits had ceased It was over nine years since Frodo had seen or heard of him and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits But that evening as Sam was walking home and twilight was fading there came the once familiar tap on the study window Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight They looked hard at one another Ah well eh said Gandalf You look the same as ever Frodo So do you Frodo replied but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world and soon they were deep in talk and they stayed up far into the night Next morning after a late breakfast the wizard was sitting with Frodo by the open window of the study A bright fire was on the hearth but the sun was warm and the wind was in the South Everything looked fresh and the new green of Spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees fingers Gandalf was thinking of a spring nearly eighty years before when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief His hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer and his face more lined with care and wisdom but his eyes were as bright as ever and he smoked and blew smokerings with the same vigour and delight He was smoking now in silence for Frodo was sitting still deep in thought Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought At last he broke the silence Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring Gandalf he said And then you stopped because you said that such matters were best left until daylight Dont you think you had better finish now You say the ring is dangerous far more dangerous than I guess In what way In many ways answered the wizard It is far more powerful than I ever dared to think at first so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it It would possess him In Eregion long ago many Elvenrings were made magic rings as you call them and they were of course of various kinds some more potent and some less The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was fullgrown and to the Elvensmiths they were but trifles yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals But the Great Rings the Rings of Power they were perilous A mortal Frodo who keeps one of the Great Rings does not die but he does not grow or obtain more life he merely continues until at last every minute is a weariness And if he often uses the Ring to make himself invisible he_ fades_ he becomes in the end invisible permanently and walks in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the Rings Yes sooner or later later if he is strong or wellmeaning to begin with but neither strength nor good purpose will last sooner or later the dark power will devour him How terrifying said Frodo There was another long silence The sound of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden How long have you known this asked Frodo at length And how much did Bilbo know Bilbo knew no more than he told you I am sure said Gandalf He would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would be a danger even though I promised to look after you He thought the ring was very beautiful and very useful at need and if anything was wrong or queer it was himself He said that it was growing on his mind and he was always worrying about it but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame Though he had found out that the thing needed looking after it did not seem always of the same size or weight it shrank or expanded in an odd way and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight Yes he warned me of that in his last letter said Frodo so I have always kept it on its chain Very wise said Gandalf But as for his long life Bilbo never connected it with the ring at all He took all the credit for that to himself and he was very proud of it Though he was getting restless and uneasy _Thin and stretched_ he said A sign that the ring was getting control How long have you known all this asked Frodo again Known said Gandalf I have known much that only the Wise know Frodo But if you mean known about _this_ ring well I still do not _know_one might say There is a last test to make But I no longer doubt my guess When did I first begin to guess he mused searching back in memory Let me see it was in the year that the White Council drove the dark power from Mirkwood just before the Battle of Five Armies that Bilbo found his ring A shadow fell on my heart then though I did not know yet what I feared I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring as plainly it was that at least was clear from the first Then I heard Bilbos strange story of how he had won it and I could not believe it When I at last got the truth out of him I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring beyond doubt Much like Gollum with his birthday present The lies were too much alike for my comfort Clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to work on its keeper at once That was the first real warning I had that all was not well I told Bilbo often that such rings were better left unused but he resented it and soon got angry There was little else that I could do I could not take it from him without doing greater harm and I had no right to do so anyway I could only watch and wait I might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White but something always held me back Who is he asked Frodo I have never heard of him before Maybe not answered Gandalf Hobbits are or were no concern of his Yet he is great among the Wise He is the chief of my order and the head of the Council His knowledge is deep but his pride has grown with it and he takes ill any meddling The lore of the Elvenrings great and small is his province He has long studied it seeking the lost secrets of their making but when the Rings were debated in the Council all that he would reveal to us of his ringlore told against my fears So my doubt slept but uneasily Still I watched and I waited And all seemed well with Bilbo And the years passed Yes they passed and they seemed not to touch him He showed no signs of age The shadow fell on me again But I said to myself After all he comes of a longlived family on his mothers side There is time yet Wait And I waited Until that night when he left this house He said and did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of Saruman could allay I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work And I have spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it There wasnt any permanent harm done was there asked Frodo anxiously He would get all right in time wouldnt he Be able to rest in peace I mean He felt better at once said Gandalf But there is only one Power in this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects and as far as I know there is no Power in the world that knows all about hobbits Among the Wise I am the only one that goes in for hobbitlore an obscure branch of knowledge but full of surprises Soft as butter they can be and yet sometimes as tough as old treeroots I think it likely that some would resist the Rings far longer than most of the Wise would believe I dont think you need worry about Bilbo Of course he possessed the ring for many years and used it so it might take a long while for the influence to wear off before it was safe for him to see it again for instance Otherwise he might live on for years quite happily just stop as he was when he parted with it For he gave it up in the end of his own accord an important point No I was not troubled about dear Bilbo any more once he had let the thing go It is for _you_ that I feel responsible Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you and about all these charming absurd helpless hobbits It would be a grievous blow to the world if the Dark Power overcame the Shire if all your kind jolly stupid Bolgers Hornblowers Boffins Bracegirdles and the rest not to mention the ridiculous Bagginses became enslaved Frodo shuddered But why should we be he asked And why should he want such slaves To tell you the truth replied Gandalf I believe that hitherto _hitherto_mark you he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits You should be thankful But your safety has passed He does not need you he has many more useful servants but he wont forget you again And hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and free There is such a thing as malice and revenge Revenge said Frodo Revenge for what I still dont understand what all this has to do with Bilbo and myself and our ring It has everything to do with it said Gandalf You do not know the real peril yet but you shall I was not sure of it myself when I was last here but the time has come to speak Give me the ring for a moment Frodo took it from his breechespocket where it was clasped to a chain that hung from his belt He unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard It felt suddenly very heavy as if either it or Frodo himself was in some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it Gandalf held it up It looked to be made of pure and solid gold Can you see any markings on it he asked No said Frodo There are none It is quite plain and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear Well then look To Frodos astonishment and distress the wizard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs but Gandalf held him back Wait he said in a commanding voice giving Frodo a quick look from under his bristling brows No apparent change came over the ring After a while Gandalf got up closed the shutters outside the window and drew the curtains The room became dark and silent though the clack of Sams shears now nearer to the windows could still be heard faintly from the garden For a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs and at once picked it up Frodo gasped It is quite cool said Gandalf Take it Frodo received it on his shrinking palm it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever Hold it up said Gandalf And look closely As Frodo did so he now saw fine lines finer than the finest penstrokes running along the ring outside and inside lines of fire that seemed to form the letters of a flowing script They shone piercingly bright and yet remote as if out of a great depth I cannot read the fiery letters said Frodo in a quavering voice No said Gandalf but I can The letters are Elvish of an ancient mode but the language is that of Mordor which I will not utter here But this in the Common Tongue is what is said close enough _One Ring to rule them all One Ring to find them One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them_ It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elvenlore _Three Rings for the Elvenkings under the sky Seven for the Dwarflords in their halls of stone Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie One Ring to rule them all One Ring to find them One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie_ He paused and then said slowly in a deep voice This is the Masterring the One Ring to rule them all This is the One Ring that he lost many ages ago to the great weakening of his power He greatly desires it but he must _not_ get it Frodo sat silent and motionless Fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming up to engulf him This ring he stammered How how on earth did it come to me Ah said Gandalf That is a very long story The beginnings lie back in the Black Years which only the loremasters now remember If I were to tell you all that tale we should still be sitting here when Spring had passed into Winter But last night I told you of Sauron the Great the Dark Lord The rumours that you have heard are true he has indeed arisen again and left his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor That name even you hobbits have heard of like a shadow on the borders of old stories Always after a defeat and a respite the Shadow takes another shape and grows again I wish it need not have happened in my time said Frodo So do I said Gandalf and so do all who live to see such times But that is not for them to decide All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us And already Frodo our time is beginning to look black The Enemy is fast becoming very strong His plans are far from ripe I think but they are ripening We shall be hard put to it We should be very hard put to it even if it were not for this dreadful chance The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance break the last defences and cover all the lands in a second darkness He lacks the One Ring The Three fairest of all the Elflords hid from him and his hand never touched them or sullied them Seven the Dwarfkings possessed but three he has recovered and the others the dragons have consumed Nine he gave to Mortal Men proud and great and so ensnared them Long ago they fell under the dominion of the One and they became Ringwraiths shadows under his great Shadow his most terrible servants Long ago It is many a year since the Nine walked abroad Yet who knows As the Shadow grows once more they too may walk again But come We will not speak of such things even in the morning of the Shire So it is now the Nine he has gathered to himself the Seven also or else they are destroyed The Three are hidden still But that no longer troubles him He only needs the One for he made that Ring himself it is his and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it so that he could rule all the others If he recovers it then he will command them all again wherever they be even the Three and all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare and he will be stronger than ever And this is the dreadful chance Frodo He believed that the One had perished that the Elves had destroyed it as should have been done But he knows now that it has _not_ perished that it has been found So he is seeking it seeking it and all his thought is bent on it It is his great hope and our great fear Why why wasnt it destroyed cried Frodo And how did the Enemy ever come to lose it if he was so strong and it was so precious to him He clutched the Ring in his hand as if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to seize it It was taken from him said Gandalf The strength of the Elves to resist him was greater long ago and not all Men were estranged from them The Men of Westernesse came to their aid That is a chapter of ancient history which it might be good to recall for there was sorrow then too and gathering dark but great valour and great deeds that were not wholly vain One day perhaps I will tell you all the tale or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best But for the moment since most of all you need to know how this thing came to you and that will be tale enough this is all that I will say It was Gilgalad Elvenking and Elendil of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron though they themselves perished in the deed and Isildur Elendils son cut the Ring from Saurons hand and took it for his own Then Sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years until his shadow took shape again in Mirkwood But the Ring was lost It fell into the Great River Anduin and vanished For Isildur was marching north along the east banks of the River and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Orcs of the Mountains and almost all his folk were slain He leaped into the waters but the Ring slipped from his finger as he swam and then the Orcs saw him and killed him with arrows Gandalf paused And there in the dark pools amid the Gladden Fields he said the Ring passed out of knowledge and legend and even so much of its history is known now only to a few and the Council of the Wise could discover no more But at last I can carry on the story I think Long after but still very long ago there lived by the banks of the Great River on the edge of Wilderland a cleverhanded and quietfooted little people I guess they were of hobbitkind akin to the fathers of the fathers of the Stoors for they loved the River and often swam in it or made little boats of reeds There was among them a family of high repute for it was large and wealthier than most and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk stern and wise in old lore such as they had The most inquisitive and curiousminded of that family was called Smagol He was interested in roots and beginnings he dived into deep pools he burrowed under trees and growing plants he tunnelled into green mounds and he ceased to look up at the hilltops or the leaves on trees or the flowers opening in the air his head and his eyes were downward He had a friend called Dagol of similar sort sharpereyed but not so quick and strong On a time they took a boat and went down to the Gladden Fields where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds There Smagol got out and went nosing about the banks but Deal sat in the boat and fished Suddenly a great fish took his hook and before he knew where he was he was dragged out and down into the water to the bottom Then he let go of his line for he thought he saw something shining in the riverbed and holding his breath he grabbed at it Then up he came spluttering with weeds in his hair and a handful of mud and he swam to the bank And behold when he washed the mud away there in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone and glittered in the sun so that his heart was glad But Smagol had been watching him from behind a tree and as Deal gloated over the ring Smagol came softly up behind Give us that Deal my love said Smagol over his friends shoulder Why said Deal Because its my birthday my love and I wants it said Smagol I dont care said Deal I have given you a present already more than I could afford I found this and Im going to keep it Oh are you indeed my love said Smagol and he caught Deal by the throat and strangled him because the gold looked so bright and beautiful Then he put the ring on his finger No one ever found out what had become of Deal he was murdered far from home and his body was cunningly hidden But Smagol returned alone and he found that none of his family could see him when he was wearing the ring He was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it and he used it to find out secrets and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses He became sharpeyed and keeneared for all that was hurtful The ring had given him power according to his stature It is not to be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned when visible by all his relations They kicked him and he bit their feet He took to thieving and going about muttering to himself and gurgling in his throat So they called him _Gollum_ and cursed him and told him to go far away and his grandmother desiring peace expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole He wandered in loneliness weeping a little for the hardness of the world and he journeyed up the River till he came to a stream that flowed down from the mountains and he went that way He caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw One day it was very hot and as he was bending over a pool he felt a burning on the back of his head and a dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes He wondered at it for he had almost forgotten about the Sun Then for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her But as he lowered his eyes he saw far above the tops of the Misty Mountains out of which the stream came And he thought suddenly It would be cool and shady under those mountains The Sun could not watch me there The roots of those mountains must be roots indeed there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning So he journeyed by night up into the highlands and he found a little cave out of which the dark stream ran and he wormed his way like a maggot into the heart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledge The Ring went into the shadows with him and even the maker when his power had begun to grow again could learn nothing of it Gollum cried Frodo Gollum Do you mean that this is the very Gollumcreature that Bilbo met How loathsome I think it is a sad story said the wizard and it might have happened to others even to some hobbits that I have known I cant believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits however distantly said Frodo with some heat What an abominable notion It is true all the same replied Gandalf About their origins at any rate I know more than hobbits do themselves And even Bilbos story suggests the kinship There was a great deal in the background of their minds and memories that was very similar They understood one another remarkably well very much better than a hobbit would understand say a Dwarf or an Orc or even an Elf Think of the riddles they both knew for one thing Yes said Frodo Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles and of much the same sort And hobbits dont cheat Gollum meant to cheat all the time He was just trying to put poor Bilbo off his guard And I daresay it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim but if he lost would not hurt him Only too true I fear said Gandalf But there was something else in it I think which you dont see yet Even Gollum was not wholly ruined He had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed as a hobbit might There was a little corner of his mind that was still his own and light came through it as through a chink in the dark light out of the past It was actually pleasant I think to hear a kindly voice again bringing up memories of wind and trees and sun on the grass and such forgotten things But that of course would only make the evil part of him angrier in the end unless it could be conquered Unless it could be cured Gandalf sighed Alas there is little hope of that for him Yet not no hope No not though he possessed the Ring so long almost as far back as he can remember For it was long since he had worn it much in the black darkness it was seldom needed Certainly he had never faded He is thin and tough still But the thing was eating up his mind of course and the torment had become almost unbearable All the great secrets under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night there was nothing more to find out nothing worth doing only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering He was altogether wretched He hated the dark and he hated light more he hated everything and the Ring most of all What do you mean said Frodo Surely the Ring was his precious and the only thing he cared for But if he hated it why didnt he get rid of it or go away and leave it You ought to begin to understand Frodo after all you have heard said Gandalf He hated it and loved it as he hated and loved himself He could not get rid of it He had no will left in the matter A Ring of Power looks after itself Frodo _It_ may slip off treacherously but its keeper never abandons it At most he plays with the idea of handing it on to someone elses care and that only at an early stage when it first begins to grip But as far as I know Bilbo alone in history has ever gone beyond playing and really done it He needed all my help too And even so he would never have just forsaken it or cast it aside It was not Gollum Frodo but the Ring itself that decided things The Ring left _him_ What just in time to meet Bilbo said Frodo Wouldnt an Orc have suited it better It is no laughing matter said Gandalf Not for you It was the strangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far Bilbos arrival just at that time and putting his hand on it blindly in the dark There was more than one power at work Frodo The Ring was trying to get back to its master It had slipped from Isildurs hand and betrayed him then when a chance came it caught poor Deal and he was murdered and after that Gollum and it had devoured him It could make no further use of him he was too small and mean and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool again So now when its master was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from Mirkwood it abandoned Gollum Only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable Bilbo from the Shire Behind that there was something else at work beyond any design of the Ringmaker I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was _meant_to find the Ring and _not_ by its maker In which case you also were _meant_to have it And that maybe an encouraging thought It is not said Frodo Though I am not sure that I understand you But how have you learned all this about the Ring and about Gollum Do you really know it all or are you just guessing still Gandalf looked at Frodo and his eyes glinted I knew much and I have learned much he answered But I am not going to give an account of all my doings to _you_ The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is known to all the Wise Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the firewriting alone apart from any other evidence And when did you discover that asked Frodo interrupting Just now in this room of course answered the wizard sharply But I expected to find it I have come back from dark journeys and long search to make that final test It is the last proof and all is now only too clear Making out Gollums part and fitting it into the gap in the history required some thought I may have started with guesses about Gollum but I am not guessing now I know I have seen him You have seen Gollum exclaimed Frodo in amazement Yes The obvious thing to do of course if one could I tried long ago but I have managed it at last Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him Do you know that Not so clearly What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to tell though not of course in the way I have reported it Gollum is a liar and you have to sift his words For instance he called the Ring his birthday present and he stuck to that He said it came from his grandmother who had lots of beautiful things of that kind A ridiculous story I have no doubt that Smagols grandmother was a matriarch a great person in her way but to talk of her possessing many Elvenrings was absurd and as for giving them away it was a lie But a lie with a grain of truth The murder of Deal haunted Gollum and he had made up a defence repeating it to his precious over and over again as he gnawed bones in the dark until he almost believed it It _was_ his birthday Deal ought to have given the ring to him It had previously turned up just so as to be a present It _was_ his birthday present and so on and on I endured him as long as I could but the truth was desperately important and in the end I had to be harsh I put the fear of fire on him and wrung the true story out of him bit by bit together with much snivelling and snarling He thought he was misunderstood and illused But when he had at last told me his history as far as the end of the Riddlegame and Bilbos escape he would not say any more except in dark hints Some other fear was on him greater than mine He muttered that he was going to gel his own back People would see if he would stand being kicked and driven into a hole and then _robbed_ Gollum had good friends now good friends and very strong They would help him Baggins would pay for it That was his chief thought He hated Bilbo and cursed his name What is more he knew where he came from But how did he find that out asked Frodo Well as for the name Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself and after that it would not be difficult to discover his country once Gollum came out Oh yes he came out His longing for the Ring proved stronger than his fear of the Orcs or even of the light After a year or two he left the mountains You see though still bound by desire of it the Ring was no longer devouring him he began to revive a little He felt old terribly old yet less timid and he was mortally hungry Light light of Sun and Moon he still feared and hated and he always will I think but he was cunning He found he could hide from daylight and moonshine and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his pale cold eyes and catch small frightened or unwary things He grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air He found his way into Mirkwood as one would expect Is that where you found him asked Frodo I saw him there answered Gandalf but before that he had wandered far following Bilbos trail It was difficult to learn anything from him for certain for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats What had it got in its pocketses he said It wouldnt say no precious Little cheat Not a fair question It cheated first it did It broke the rules We ought to have squeezed it yes precious And we will precious That is a sample of his talk I dont suppose you want any more I had weary days of it But from hints dropped among the snarls I even gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to Esgaroth and even to the streets of Dale listening secretly and peering Well the news of the great events went far and wide in Wilderland and many had heard Bilbos name and knew where he came from We had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the West Gollums sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted Then why didnt he track Bilbo further asked Frodo Why didnt he come to the Shire Ah said Gandalf now we come to it I think Gollum tried to He set out and came back westward as far as the Great River But then he turned aside He was not daunted by the distance I am sure No something else drew him away So my friends think those that hunted him for me The Woodelves tracked him first an easy task for them for his trail was still fresh then Through Mirkwood and back again it led them though they never caught him The wood was full of the rumour of him dreadful tales even among beasts and birds The Woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad a ghost that drank blood It climbed trees to find nests it crept into holes to find the young it slipped through windows to find cradles But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away It wandered off southwards and passed out of the Woodelves ken and was lost And then I made a great mistake Yes Frodo and not the first though I fear it may prove the worst I let the matter be I let him go for I had much else to think of at that time and I still trusted the lore of Saruman Well that was years ago I have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days The trail was long cold when I took it up again after Bilbo left here And my search would have been in vain but for the help that I had from a friend Aragorn the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world Together we sought for Gollum down the whole length of Wilderland without hope and without success But at last when I had given up the chase and turned to other parts Gollum was found My friend returned out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him What he had been doing he would not say He only wept and called us cruel with many a _gollum_ in his throat and when we pressed him he whined and cringed and rubbed his long hands licking his fingers as if they pained him as if he remembered some old torture But I am afraid there is no possible doubt he had made his slow sneaking way step by step mile by mile south down at last to the Land of Mordor A heavy silence fell in the room Frodo could hear his heart beating Even outside everything seemed still No sound of Sams shears could now be heard Yes to Mordor said Gandalf Alas Mordor draws all wicked things and the Dark Power was bending all its will to gather them there The Ring of the Enemy would leave its mark too leave him open to the summons And all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South and its hatred of the West There were his fine new friends who would help him in his revenge Wretched fool In that land he would learn much too much for his comfort And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would be caught and taken for examination That was the way of it I fear When he was found he had already been there long and was on his way back On some errand of mischief But that does not matter much now His worst mischief was done Yes alas through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been found again He knows where Isildur fell He knows where Gollum found his ring He knows that it is a Great Ring for it gave long life He knows that it is not one of the Three for they have never been lost and they endure no evil He knows that it is not one of the Seven or the Nine for they are accounted for He knows that it is the One And he has at last heard I think of _hobbits_ and the _Shire_ The Shire he may be seeking for it now if he has not already found out where it lies Indeed Frodo I fear that he may even think that the longunnoticed name of _Baggins_ has become important But this is terrible cried Frodo Far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and warnings O Gandalf best of friends what am I to do For now I am really afraid What am I to do What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature when he had a chance Pity It was Pity that stayed his hand Pity and Mercy not to strike without need And he has been well rewarded Frodo Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil and escaped in the end because he began his ownership of the Ring so With Pity I am sorry said Frodo But I am frightened and I do not feel any pity for Gollum You have not seen him Gandalf broke in No and I dont want to said Frodo I cant understand you Do you mean to say that you and the Elves have let him live on after all those horrible deeds Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc and just an enemy He deserves death Deserves it I daresay he does Many that live deserve death And some that die deserve life Can you give it to them Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement For even the very wise cannot see all ends I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies but there is a chance of it And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet for good or ill before the end and when that comes the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many yours not least In any case we did not kill him he is very old and very wretched The Woodelves have him in prison but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts All the same said Frodo even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum I wish he had not kept the Ring I wish he had never found it and that I had not got it Why did you let me keep it Why didnt you make me throw it away or or destroy it Let you Make you said the wizard Havent you been listening to all that I have said You are not thinking of what you are saying But as for throwing it away that was obviously wrong These Rings have a way of being found In evil hands it might have done great evil Worst of all it might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy Indeed it certainly would for this is the One and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself Of course my dear Frodo it was dangerous for you and that has troubled me deeply But there was so much at stake that I had to take some risk though even when I was far away there has never been a day when the Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes As long as you never used it I did not think that the Ring would have any lasting effect on you not for evil not at any rate for a very long time And you must remember that nine years ago when I last saw you I still knew little for certain But why not destroy it as you say should have been done long ago cried Frodo again If you had warned me or even sent me a message I would have done away with it Would you How would you do that Have you ever tried No But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it Try said Gandalf Try now Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it It now appeared plain and smooth without mark or device that he could see The gold looked very fair and pure and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its colour how perfect was its roundness It was an admirable thing and altogether precious When he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest part of the fire But he found now that he could not do so not without a great struggle He weighed the Ring in his hand hesitating and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him and then with an effort of will he made a movement as if to cast it away but he found that he had put it back in his pocket Gandalf laughed grimly You see Already you too Frodo cannot easily let it go nor will to damage it And I could not make you except by force which would break your mind But as for breaking the Ring force is useless Even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledgehammer it would make no dint in it It cannot be unmade by your hands or by mine Your small fire of course would not melt even ordinary gold This Ring has already passed through it unscathed and even unheated But there is no smiths forge in this Shire that could change it at all Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that It has been said that dragonfire could melt and consume the Rings of Power but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough nor was there ever any dragon not even Ancalagon the Black who could have harmed the One Ring the Ruling Ring for that was made by Sauron himself There is only one way to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin the Firemountain and cast the Ring in there if you really wish to destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever I do really wish to destroy it cried Frodo Or well to have it destroyed I am not made for perilous quests I wish I had never seen the Ring Why did it come to me Why was I chosen Such questions cannot be answered said Gandalf You may be sure that it was not for any merit that others do not possess not for power or wisdom at any rate But you have been chosen and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have But I have so little of any of these things You are wise and powerful Will you not take the Ring No cried Gandalf springing to his feet With that power I should have power too great and terrible And over me the Ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly His eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within Do not tempt me For I do not wish to become like the Dark Lord himself Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good Do not tempt me I dare not take it not even to keep it safe unused The wish to wield it would be too great for my strength I shall have such need of it Great perils lie before me He went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters Sunlight streamed back again into the room Sam passed along the path outside whistling And now said the wizard turning back to Frodo the decision lies with you But I will always help you He laid his hand on Frodos shoulder I will help you bear this burden as long as It is yours to bear But we must do something soon The Enemy is moving There was a long silence Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thought His eyes seemed closed but under the lids he was watching Frodo intently Frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth until they filled all his vision and he seemed to be looking down into profound wells of fire He was thinking of the fabled Cracks of Doom and the terror of the Fiery Mountain Well said Gandalf at last What are you thinking about Have you decided what to do No answered Frodo coming back to himself out of darkness and finding to his surprise that it was not dark and that out of the window he could see the sunlit garden Or perhaps yes As far as I understand what you have said I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it at least for the present whatever it may do to me Whatever it may do it will be slow slow to evil if you keep it with that purpose said Gandalf I hope so said Frodo But I hope that you may find some other better keeper soon But in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger a danger to all that live near me I cannot keep the Ring and stay here I ought to leave Bag End leave the Shire leave everything and go away He sighed I should like to save the Shire if I could though there have been times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them But I dont feel like that now I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind safe and comfortable I shall find wandering more bearable I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold even if my feet cannot stand there again Of course I have sometimes thought of going away but I imagined that as a kind of holiday a series of adventures like Bilbos or better ending in peace But this would mean exile a flight from danger into danger drawing it after me And I suppose I must go alone if I am to do that and save the Shire But I feel very small and very uprooted and well desperate The Enemy is so strong and terrible He did not tell Gandalf but as he was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart to follow Bilbo and even perhaps to find him again It was so strong that it overcame his fear he could almost have run out there and then down the road without his hat as Bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago My dear Frodo exclaimed Gandalf Hobbits really are amazing creatures as I have said before You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch I hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir though he little thought how important it would prove I am afraid you are right The Ring will not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much longer and for your own sake as well as for others you will have to go and leave the name of Baggins behind you That name will not be safe to have outside the Shire or in the Wild I will give you a travelling name now When you go go as Mr Underhill But I dont think you need go alone Not if you know of anyone you can trust and who would be willing to go by your side and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils But if you look for a companion be careful in choosing And be careful of what you say even to your closest friends The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing Suddenly he stopped as if listening Frodo became aware that all was very quiet inside and outside Gandalf crept to one side of the window Then with a dart he sprang to the sill and thrust a long arm out and downwards There was a squawk and up came Sam Gamgees curly head hauled by one ear Well well bless my beard said Gandalf Sam Gamgee is it Now what may you be doing Lor bless you Mr Gandalf sir said Sam Nothing Leastways I was just trimming the grassborder under the window if you follow me He picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence I dont said Gandalf grimly It is some time since I last heard the sound of your shears How long have you been eavesdropping Eavesdropping sir I dont follow you begging your pardon There aint no eaves at Bag End and thats a fact Dont be a fool What have you heard and why did you listen Gandalfs eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles Mr Frodo sir cried Sam quaking Dont let him hurt me sir Dont let him turn me into anything unnatural My old dad would take on so I meant no harm on my honour sir He wont hurt you said Frodo hardly able to keep from laughing although he was himself startled and rather puzzled He knows as well as I do that you mean no harm But just you up and answer his questions straight away Well sir said Sam dithering a little I heard a deal that I didnt rightly understand about an enemy and rings and Mr Bilbo sir and dragons and a fiery mountain and and Elves sir I listened because I couldnt help myself if you know what I mean Lor bless me sir but I do love tales of that sort And I believe them too whatever Ted may say Elves sir I would dearly love to see _them_ Couldnt you take me to see Elves sir when you go Suddenly Gandalf laughed Come inside he shouted and putting out both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam shears grassclippings and all right through the window and stood him on the floor Take you to see Elves eh he said eyeing Sam closely but with a smile flickering on his face So you heard that Mr Frodo is going away I did sir And thats why I choked which you heard seemingly I tried not to sir but it burst out of me I was so upset It cant be helped Sam said Frodo sadly He had suddenly realized that flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End I shall have to go But and here he looked hard at Sam if you really care about me you will keep that _dead_ secret See If you dont if you even breathe a word of what youve heard here then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grasssnakes Sam fell on his knees trembling Get up Sam said Gandalf I have thought of something better than that Something to shut your mouth and punish you properly for listening You shall go away with Mr Frodo Me sir cried Sam springing up like a dog invited for a walk Me go and see Elves and all Hooray he shouted and then burst into tears _Chapter 3_ Three is Company You ought to go quietly and you ought to go soon said Gandalf Two or three weeks had passed and still Frodo made no sign of getting ready to go I know But it is difficult to do both he objected If I just vanish like Bilbo the tale will be all over the Shire in no time Of course you mustnt vanish said Gandalf That wouldnt do at all I said _soon_ not _instantly_ If you can think of any way of slipping out of the Shire without its being generally known it will be worth a little delay But you must not delay too long What about the autumn on or after Our Birthday asked Frodo I think I could probably make some arrangements by then To tell the truth he was very reluctant to start now that it had come to the point Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than it had for years and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the Shire When autumn came he knew that part at least of his heart would think more kindly of journeying as it always did at that season He had indeed privately made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday Bilbos one hundred and twentyeighth It seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow him Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind and the one thing that made the thought of leaving bearable He thought as little as possible about the Ring and where it might lead him in the end But he did not tell all his thoughts to Gandalf What the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell He looked at Frodo and smiled Very well he said I think that will do but it must not be any later I am getting very anxious In the meanwhile do take care and dont let out any hint of where you are going And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk If he does I really shall turn him into a toad As for _where I_ am going said Frodo it would be difficult to give that away for I have no clear idea myself yet Dont be absurd said Gandalf I am not warning you against leaving an address at the postoffice But you are leaving the Shire and that should not be known until you are far away And you must go or at least set out either North South West or East and the direction should certainly not be known I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End and of saying farewell that I have never even considered the direction said Frodo For where am I to go And by what shall I steer What is to be my quest Bilbo went to find a treasure there and back again but I go to lose one and not return as far as I can see But you cannot see very far said Gandalf Neither can I It may be your task to find the Cracks of Doom but that quest may be for others I do not know At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet No indeed said Frodo But in the meantime what course am I to lake Towards danger but not too rashly nor too straight answered the wizard If you want my advice make for Rivendell That journey should not prove too perilous though the Road is less easy than it was and it will grow worse as the year fails Rivendell said Frodo Very good I will go east and I will make for Rivendell I will take Sam to visit the Elves he will be delighted He spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the house of Elrond Halfelven and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace One summers evening an astonishing piece of news reached the _Ivy Bush_ and _Green Dragon_ Giants and other portents on the borders of the Shire were forgotten for more important matters Mr Frodo was selling Bag End indeed he had already sold it to the SackvilleBagginses For a nice bit loo said some At a bargain price said others and thats more likely when Mistress Lobelias the buyer Otho had died some years before at the ripe but disappointed age of 102 Just why Mr Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable than the price A few held the theory supported by the nods and hints of Mr Baggins himself that Frodos money was running out he was going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations As far from the SackvilleBagginses as may be some added But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that most found this hard to believe harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day it was well known that he was hiding up in the Bag End But however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry there was no doubt about the fact Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland Yes I shall be moving this autumn he said Merry Brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole for me or perhaps a small house As a matter of fact with Merrys help he had already chosen and bought a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury To all but Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently The decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him for Buckland was on the eastern borders of the Shire and as he had lived there in childhood his going back would at least seem credible Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months Then one evening at the end of June soon after Frodos plan had been finally arranged he suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning Only for a short while I hope he said But I am going down beyond the southern borders to get some news if I can I have been idle longer than I should He spoke lightly but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried Has anything happened he asked Well no but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs looking into If I think it necessary after all for you to get off at once I shall come back immediately or at least send word In the meanwhile stick to your plan but be more careful than ever especially of the Ring Let me impress on you once more _dont use it_ He went off at dawn I may be back any day he said At the very latest I shall come back for the farewell party I think after all you may need my company on the Road At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed and wondered often what Gandalf could have heard but his uneasiness wore off and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while The Shire had seldom seen so fair a summer or so rich an autumn the trees were laden with apples honey was dripping in the combs and the corn was tall and full Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf again September was passing and there was still no news of him The Birthday and the removal drew nearer and still he did not come or send word Bag End began to be busy Some of Frodos friends came to stay and help him with the packing there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin and of course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck Between them they turned the whole place upsidedown On September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland conveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to his new home by way of the Brandywine Bridge The next day Frodo became really anxious and kept a constant lookout for Gandalf Thursday his birthday morning dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for Bilbos great party Still Gandalf did not appear In the evening Frodo gave his farewell feast it was quite small just a dinner for himself and his four helpers but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it The thought that he would so soon have to part with his young friends weighed on his heart He wondered how he would break it to them The four younger hobbits were however in high spirits and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalfs absence The diningroom was bare except for a table and chairs but the food was good and there was good wine Frodos wine had not been included in the sale to the SackvilleBagginses Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff when the SBs get their claws on it at any rate I have found a good home for this said Frodo as he drained his glass It was the last drop of Old Winyards When they had sung many songs and talked of many things they had done together they toasted Bilbos birthday and they drank his health and Frodos together according to Frodos custom Then they went out for a sniff of air and glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed Frodos party was over and Gandalf had not come The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the luggage Merry took charge of this and drove off with Fatty that is Fredegar Bolger Someone must get there and warm the house before you arrive said Merry Well see you later the day after tomorrow if you dont go to sleep on the way Folco went home after lunch but Pippin remained behind Frodo was restless and anxious listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf He decided to wait until nightfall After that if Gandalf wanted him urgently he would go to Crickhollow and might even get there first For Frodo was going on foot His plan for pleasure and a last look at the Shire as much as any other reason was to walk from Hobbiton to Bucklebury Ferry taking it fairly easy I shall get myself a bit into training too he said looking at himself in a dusty mirror in the halfempty hall He had not done any strenuous walking for a long time and the reflection looked rather flabby he thought After lunch the SackvilleBagginses Lobelia and her sandyhaired son Lotho turned up much to Frodos annoyance Ours at last said Lobelia as she stepped inside It was not polite nor strictly true for the sale of Bag End did not take effect until midnight But Lobelia can perhaps be forgiven she had been obliged to wait about seventyseven years longer for Bag End than she once hoped and she was now a hundred years old Anyway she had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off and she wanted the keys It took a long while to satisfy her as she had brought a complete inventory with her and went right through it In the end she departed with Lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key would be left at the Gamgees in Bagshot Row She snorted and showed plainly that she thought the Gamgees capable of plundering the hole during the night Frodo did not offer her any tea He took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen It had been officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland to do for Mr Frodo and look after his bit of garden an arrangement that was approved by the Gaffer though it did not console him for the prospect of having Lobelia as a neighbour Our last meal at Bag End said Frodo pushing back his chair They left the washing up for Lobelia Pippin and Sam strapped up their three packs and piled them in the porch Pippin went out for a last stroll in the garden Sam disappeared The sun went down Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled Frodo wandered round the familiar rooms and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls and shadows creep out of the corners It grew slowly dark indoors He went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path and then on a short way down the Hill Road He half expected to see Gandalf come striding up through the dusk The sky was clear and the stars were growing bright Its going to be a fine night he said aloud Thats good for a beginning I feel like walking I cant bear any more hanging about I am going to start and Gandalf must follow me He turned to go back and then slopped for he heard voices just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row One voice was certainly the old Gaffers the other was strange and somehow unpleasant He could not make out what it said but he heard the Gaffers answers which were rather shrill The old man seemed put out No Mr Baggins has gone away Went this morning and my Sam went with him anyway all his stuff went Yes sold out and gone I tellee Why Whys none of my business or yours Where to That aint no secret Hes moved to Bucklebury or some such place away down yonder Yes it is a tidy way Ive never been so far myself theyre queer folks in Buckland No I cant give no message Good night to you Footsteps went away down the Hill Frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that they did not come on up the Hill seemed a great relief I am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings I suppose he thought What an inquisitive lot they all are He had half a mind to go and ask the Gaffer who the inquirer was but he thought better or worse of it and turned and walked quickly back to Bag End Pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch Sam was not there Frodo stepped inside the dark door Sam he called Sam Time Coming sir came the answer from far within followed soon by Sam himself wiping his mouth He had been saying farewell to the beerbarrel in the cellar All aboard Sam said Frodo Yes sir Ill last for a bit now sir Frodo shut and locked the round door and gave the key to Sam Run down with this to your home Sam he said Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows We are not going through the village tonight Too many ears pricking and eyes prying Sam ran off at full speed Well now were off at last said Frodo They shouldered their packs and took up their sticks and walked round the corner to the west side of Bag End Goodbye said Frodo looking at the dark blank windows He waved his hand and then turned and following Bilbo if he had known it hurried after Peregrin down the gardenpath They jumped over the low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the fields passing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses At the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane There they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs Presently Sam appeared trotting quickly and breathing hard his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders and he had put on his head a tall shapeless fell bag which he called a hat In the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff said Frodo I pity snails and all that carry their homes on their backs I could take a lot more yet sir My packet is quite light said Sam stoutly and untruthfully No you dont Sam said Pippin It is good for him Hes got nothing except what he ordered us to pack Hes been slack lately and hell feel the weight less when hes walked off some of his own Be kind to a poor old hobbit laughed Frodo I shall be as thin as a willowwand Im sure before I get to Buckland But I was talking nonsense I suspect you have taken more than your share Sam and I shall look into it at our next packing He picked up his stick again Well we all like walking in the dark he said so lets put some miles behind us before bed For a short way they followed the lane westwards Then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to the fields again They went in single file along hedgerows and the borders of coppices and night fell dark about them In their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings Since they were all hobbits and were trying to be silent they made no noise that even hobbits would hear Even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing After some time they crossed the Water west of Hobbiton by a narrow plankbridge The stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon bordered with leaning aldertrees A mile or two further south they hastily crossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge they were now in the Tookland and bending southeastwards they made for the Green Hill Country As they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the Water Soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land and was followed by Bywater beside its grey pool When the light of the last farm was far behind peeping among the trees Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again he said quietly When they had walked for about three hours they rested The night was clear cool and starry but smokelike wisps of mist were creeping up the hillsides from the streams and deep meadows Thinclad birches swaying in a light wind above their heads made a black net against the pale sky They ate a very frugal supper for hobbits and then went on again Soon they struck a narrow road that went rolling up and down fading grey into the darkness ahead the road to Woodhall and Stock and the Bucklebury Ferry It climbed away from the main road in the Watervalley and wound over the skirts of the Green Hills towards WoodyEnd a wild corner of the Eastfarthing After a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night It was very dark At first they talked or hummed a tune softly together being now far away from inquisitive ears Then they marched on in silence and Pippin began to lag behind At last as they began to climb a steep slope he stopped and yawned I am so sleepy he said that soon I shall fall down on the road Are you going to sleep on your legs It is nearly midnight I thought you liked walking in the dark said Frodo But there is no great hurry Merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow but that leaves us nearly two days more Well halt at the first likely spot The winds in the West said Sam If we get to the other side of this hill we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough sir There is a dry firwood just ahead if I remember rightly Sam knew the land well within twenty miles of Hobbiton but that was the limit of his geography Just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of firwood Leaving the road they went into the deep resinscented darkness of the trees and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire Soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large firtree and they sat round it for a while until they began to nod Then each in an angle of the great trees roots they curled up in their cloaks and blankets and were soon fast asleep They set no watch even Frodo feared no danger yet for they were still in the heart of the Shire A few creatures came and looked at them when the fire had died away A fox passing through the wood on business of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed Hobbits he thought Well what next I have heard of strange doings in this land but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a tree Three of them Theres something mighty queer behind this He was quite right but he never found out any more about it The morning came pale and clammy Frodo woke up first and found that a treeroot had made a hole in his back and that his neck was stiff Walking for pleasure Why didnt I drive he thought as he usually did at the beginning of an expedition And all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the SackvilleBagginses These treeroots would do them good He stretched Wake up hobbits he cried Its a beautiful morning Whats beautiful about it said Pippin peering over the edge of his blanket with one eye Sam Gel breakfast ready for halfpast nine Have you got the bathwater hot Sam jumped up looking rather bleary No sir I havent sir he said Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over and then walked off to the edge of the wood Away eastward the sun was rising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world Touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea A little below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going Water shouted Pippin Wheres the water I dont keep water in my pockets said Frodo We thought you had gone to find some said Pippin busy setting out the food and cups You had better go now You can come too said Frodo and bring all the waterbottles There was a stream at the foot of the hill They filled their bottles and the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet over an outcrop of grey stone It was icy cold and they spluttered and puffed as they bathed their faces and hands When their breakfast was over and their packs all trussed up again it was after ten oclock and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot They went down the slope and across the stream where it dived under the road and up the next slope and up and down another shoulder of the hills and by that time their cloaks blankets water food and other gear already seemed a heavy burden The days march promised to be warm and tiring work After some miles however the road ceased to roll up and down it climbed to the top of a steep bank in a weary zigzagging sort of way and then prepared to go down for the last time In front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland haze They were looking across the Woody End towards the Brandywine River The road wound away before them like a piece of string The road goes on for ever said Pippin but I cant without a rest It is high time for lunch He sat down on the bank at the side of the road and looked away east into the haze beyond which lay the River and the end of the Shire in which he had spent all his life Sam stood by him His round eyes were wide open for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon Do Elves live in those woods he asked Not that I ever heard said Pippin Frodo was silent He too was gazing eastward along the road as if he had never seen it before Suddenly he spoke aloud but as if to himself saying slowly The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began Now far ahead the Road has gone And I must follow if I can Pursuing it with weary feet Until it joins some larger way Where many paths and errands meet And whither then I cannot say That sounds like a bit of old Bilbos rhyming said Pippin Or is it one of your imitations It does not sound altogether encouraging I dont know said Frodo It came to me then as if I was making it up but I may have heard it long ago Certainly it reminds me very much of Bilbo in the last years before he went away He used often to say there was only one Road that it was like a great river its springs were at every doorstep and every path was its tributary Its a dangerous business Frodo going out of your door he used to say You step into the Road and if you dont keep your feet there is no knowing where you might be swept off to Do you realize that this is the very path that goes through Mirkwood and that if you let it it might take you to the Lonely Mountain or even further and to worse places He used to say that on the path outside the front door at Bag End especially after he had been out for a long walk Well the Road wont sweep me anywhere for an hour at least said Pippin unslinging his pack The others followed his example putting their packs against the bank and their legs out into the road After a rest they had a good lunch and then more rest The sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as they went down the hill So far they had not met a soul on the road This way was not much used being hardly fit for carts and there was little traffic to the Woody End They had been jogging along again for an hour or more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening They were now on level ground and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through grassland sprinkled with tall trees outliers of the approaching woods I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind said Sam They looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us said Frodo but even as he said it he had a feeling that it was not so and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him It may not matter much he said apologetically but I would rather not be seen on the road by anyone I am sick of my doings being noticed and discussed And if it is Gandalf he added as an afterthought we can give him a little surprise to pay him out for being so late Lets get out of sight The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not far from the road There they lay flat Frodo hesitated for a second curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide The sound of hoofs drew nearer Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road Then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots Round the corner came a black horse no hobbitpony but a fullsized horse and on it sat a large man who seemed to crouch in the saddle wrapped in a great black cloak and hood so that only his boots in the high stirrups showed below his face was shadowed and invisible When it reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed as if listening From inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent the head turned from side to side of the road A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo and he thought of his Ring He hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand He felt that he had only to slip it on and then he would be safe The advice of Gandalf seemed absurd Bilbo had used the Ring And I am still in the Shire he thought as his hand touched the chain on which it hung At that moment the rider sat up and shook the reins The horse stepped forward walking slowly at first and then breaking into a quick trot Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider until he dwindled into the distance He could not be quite sure but it seemed to him that suddenly before it passed out of sight the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right Well I call that very queer and indeed disturbing said Frodo to himself as he walked towards his companions Pippin and Sam had remained flat in the grass and had seen nothing so Frodo described the rider and his strange behaviour I cant say why but I felt certain he was looking or _smelling_ for me and also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me Ive never seen or fell anything like it in the Shire before But what has one of the Big People got to do with us said Pippin And what is he doing in this part of the world There are some Men about said Frodo Down in the Southfarthing they have had trouble with Big People I believe But I have never heard of anything like this rider I wonder where he comes from Begging your pardon put in Sam suddenly I know where he comes from Its from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes unless theres more than one And I know where hes going to What do you mean said Frodo sharply looking at him in astonishment Why didnt you speak up before I have only just remembered sir It was like this when I got back to our hole yesterday evening with the key my dad he says to me _Hello Sam_ he says _I thought you were away with Mr Frodo this morning Theres been a strange customer asking for Mr Baggins of Bag End and hes only just gone Ive sent him on to Bucklebury Not that I liked the sound of him He seemed mighty put out when I told him Mr Baggins had left his old home for good Hissed at me he did It gave me quite a shudder What sort of a fellow was he_ says I to the Gaffer _I dont know_ says he _but he wasnt a hobbit He was tall and blacklike and he stooped aver me I reckon it was one of the Big Folk from foreign parts He spoke funny_ I couldnt stay to hear more sir since you were waiting and I didnt give much heed to it myself The Gaffer is getting old and more than a bit blind and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the Hill and found him taking the air at the end of our Row I hope he hasnt done no harm sir nor me The Gaffer cant be blamed anyway said Frodo As a matter of fact I heard him talking to a stranger who seemed to be inquiring for me and I nearly went and asked him who it was I wish I had or you had told me about it before I might have been more careful on the road Still there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffers stranger said Pippin We left Hobbiton secretly enough and I dont see how he could have followed us What about the _smelling_ sir said Sam And the Gaffer said he was a black chap I wish I had waited for Gandalf Frodo muttered But perhaps it would only have made matters worse Then you know or guess something about this rider said Pippin who had caught the muttered words I dont know and I would rather not guess said Frodo All right cousin Frodo You can keep your secret for the present if you want to be mysterious In the meanwhile what are we to do I should like a bite and a sup but somehow I think we had better move on from here Your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me Yes I think we will move on now said Frodo but not on the road in case that rider comes back or another follows him We ought to do a good step more today Buckland is still miles away The shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass as they started off again They now kept a stones throw to the left of the road and kept out of sight of it as much as they could But this hindered them for the grass was thick and tussocky and the ground uneven and the trees began to draw together into thickets The sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs and evening was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level over which it had run straight for some miles At that point it bent left and went down into the lowlands of the Yale making for Stock but a lane branched right winding through a wood of ancient oaktrees on its way to Woodhall That is the way for us said Frodo Not far from the roadmeeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree it was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out round the broken stumps of its longfallen limbs but it was hollow and could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road The hobbits crept inside and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed wood They rested and had a light meal talking quietly and listening from time to time Twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane The West wind was sighing in the branches Leaves were whispering Soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk A star came out above the trees in the darkening East before them They went abreast and in step to keep up their spirits After a time as the stars grew thicker and brighter the feeling of disquiet left them and they no longer listened for the sound of hoofs They began to hum softly as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk along especially when they are drawing near to home at night With most hobbits it is a suppersong or a bedsong but these hobbits hummed a walkingsong though not of course without any mention of supper and bed Bilbo Baggins had made the words to a tune that was as old as the hills and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Watervalley and talked about Adventure Upon the hearth the fire is red Beneath the roof there is a bed But not yet weary are our feet Still round the corner we may meet A sudden tree or standing stone That none have seen but we alone Tree and flower and leaf and grass Let them pass Let them pass Hill and water under sky Pass them by Pass them by Still round the corner there may wait A new road or a secret gate And though we pass them by today Tomorrow we may come this way And take the hidden paths that run Towards the Moon or to the Sun Apple thorn and nut and sloe Let them go Let them go Sand and stone and pool and dell Fare you well Fare you well Home is behind the world ahead And there are many paths to tread Through shadows to the edge of night Until the stars are all alight Then world behind and home ahead Well wander back to home and bed Mist and twilight cloud and shade Away shall fade Away shall fade Fire and lamp and meat and bread And then to bed And then to bed The song ended And _now_ to bed And _now_ to bed sang Pippin in a high voice Hush said Frodo I think I hear hoofs again They slopped suddenly and stood as silent as treeshadows listening There was a sound of hoofs in the lane some way behind but coming slow and clear down the wind Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path and ran into the deeper shade under the oaktrees Dont let us go too far said Frodo I dont want to be seen but I want to see if it is another Black Rider Very well said Pippin But dont forget the sniffing The hoofs drew nearer They had no time to find any hidingplace better than the general darkness under the trees Sam and Pippin crouched behind a large treebole while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane It showed grey and pale a line of fading light through the wood Above it the stars were thick in the dim sky but there was no moon The sound of hoofs stopped As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass across the lighter space between two trees and then halt It looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow The black shadow stood close to the point where they had left the path and it swayed from side to side Frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling The shadow bent to the ground and then began to crawl towards him Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo but this time it was stronger than before So strong that almost before he realized what he was doing his hand was groping in his pocket But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughter Clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air The black shadow straightened up and retreated It climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side Frodo breathed again Elves exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper Elves sir He would have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices if they had not pulled him back Yes it is Elves said Frodo One can meet them sometimes in the Woody End They dont live in the Shire but they wander into it in Spring and Autumn out of their own lands away beyond the Tower Hills I am thankful that they do You did not see but that Black Rider stopped just here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began As soon as he heard the voices he slipped away What about the Elves said Sam too excited to trouble about the rider Cant we go and see them Listen They are coming this way said Frodo We have only to wait The singing drew nearer One clear voice rose now above the others It was singing in the fair elventongue of which Frodo knew only a little and the others knew nothing Yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape itself in their thought into words which they only partly understood This was the song as Frodo heard it Snowwhite Snowwhite O Lady clear O Queen beyond the Western Seas O Light to us that wander here Amid the world of woven trees Gilthoniel O Elbereth Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath Snowwhite Snowwhite We sing to thee In a far land beyond the Sea O stars that in the Sunless Year With shining hand by her were sawn In windy fields now bright and clear We see your silver blossom blown O Elbereth Gilthoniel We still remember we who dwell In this far land beneath the trees Thy starlight on the Western Seas The song ended These are High Elves They spoke the name of Elbereth said Frodo in amazement Few of that fairest folk are ever seen in the Shire Not many now remain in Middleearth east of the Great Sea This is indeed a strange chance The hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside Before long the Elves came down the lane towards the valley They passed slowly and the hobbits could see the starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyes They bore no lights yet as they walked a shimmer like the light of the moon above the rim of the hills before it rises seemed to fall about their feet They were now silent and as the last Elf passed he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed Hail Frodo he cried You are abroad late Or are you perhaps lost Then he called aloud to the others and all the company stopped and gathered round This is indeed wonderful they said Three hobbits in a wood at night We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away What is the meaning of it The meaning of it fair people said Frodo is simply that we seem to be going the same way as you are I like walking under the stars But I would welcome your company But we have no need of other company and hobbits are so dull they laughed And how do you know that we go the same way as you for you do not know whither we are going And how do you know my name asked Frodo in return We know many things they said We have seen you often before with Bilbo though you may not have seen us Who are you and who is your lord asked Frodo I am Gildor answered their leader the Elf who had first hailed him Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod We are Exiles and most of our kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a while ere we return over the Great Sea But some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peace in Rivendell Come now Frodo tell us what you are doing For we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you O Wise People interrupted Pippin eagerly Tell us about the Black Riders Black Riders they said in low voices Why do you ask about Black Riders Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today or one has done so twice said Pippin only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew near The Elves did not answer at once but spoke together softly in their own tongue At length Gildor turned to the hobbits We will not speak of this here he said We think you had best come now with us It is not our custom but for this time we will lake you on our road and you shall lodge with us tonight if you will O Fair Folk This is good fortune beyond my hope said Pippin Sam was speechless I thank you indeed Gildor Inglorion said Frodo bowing _Elen sla lmenn omentielvo_ a star shines on the hour of our meeting he added in the highelven speech Be careful friends cried Gildor laughing Speak no secrets Here is a scholar in the Ancient Tongue Bilbo was a good master Hail Elffriend he said bowing to Frodo Come now with your friends and join our company You had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray You may be weary before we halt Why Where are you going asked Frodo For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall It is some miles but you shall have rest at the end of it and it will shorten your journey tomorrow They now marched on again in silence and passed like shadows and faint lights for Elves even more than hobbits could walk when they wished without sound or footfall Pippin soon began to feel sleepy and staggered once or twice but each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm and saved him from a fall Sam walked along at Frodos side as if in a dream with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy The woods on either side became denser the trees were now younger and thicker and as the lane went lower running down into a fold of the hills there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand At last the Elves turned aside from the path A green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right and this they followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the rivervalley Suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees and before them lay a wide space of grass grey under the night On three sides the woods pressed upon it but eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees growing at the bottom of the slope were below their feet Beyond the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of Woodhall The Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices they seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits Frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets and drowsiness stole over them The night grew on and the lights in the valley went out Pippin fell asleep pillowed on a green hillock Away high in the East swung Remmirath the Netted Stars and slowly above the mists red Borgil rose glowing like a jewel of fire Then by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil and there leaned up as he climbed over the rim of the world the Swordsman of the Sky Menelvagor with his shining belt The Elves all burst into song Suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light Come the Elves called to the hobbits Come Now is the time for speech and merriment Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes He shivered There is a fire in the hall and food for hungry guests said an Elf standing before him At the south end of the greensward there was an opening There the green floor ran on into the wood and formed a wide space like a hall roofed by the boughs of trees Their great trunks ran like pillars down each side In the middle there was a woodfire blazing and upon the treepillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily The Elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks Some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink others brought food on heaped plates and dishes This is poor fare they said to the hobbits for we are lodging in the greenwood far from our halls If ever you are our guests at home we will treat you better It seems to me good enough for a birthdayparty said Frodo Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink for his mind was filled with the light upon the elffaces and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream But he remembered that there was bread surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who is starving and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended fruits of gardens he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught cool as a clear fountain golden as a summer afternoon Sam could never describe in words nor picture clearly to himself what he felt or thought that night though it remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life The nearest he ever got was to say Well sir if I could grow apples like that I would call myself a gardener But it was the singing that went to my heart if you know what I mean Frodo sat eating drinking and talking with delight but his mind was chiefly on the words spoken He knew a little of the elfspeech and listened eagerly Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own language They smiled at him and said laughing Here is a jewel among hobbits After a while Pippin fell fast asleep and was lifted up and borne away to a bower under the trees there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away Sam refused to leave his master When Pippin had gone he came and sat curled up at Frodos feet where at last he nodded and closed his eyes Frodo remained long awake talking with Gildor They spoke of many things old and new and Frodo questioned Gildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire The tidings were mostly sad and ominous of gathering darkness the wars of Men and the flight of the Elves At last Frodo asked the question that was nearest to his heart Tell me Gildor have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us Gildor smiled Yes he answered Twice He said farewell to us on this very spot But I saw him once again far from here He would say no more about Bilbo and Frodo fell silent You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself Frodo said Gildor But I already know a little and I can read more in your face and in the thought behind your questions You are leaving the Shire and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek or accomplish what you intend or that you will ever return Is not that so It is said Frodo but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam He looked down at Sam who was snoring gently The secret will not reach the Enemy from us said Gildor The Enemy said Frodo Then you know why I am leaving the Shire I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you answered Gildor but I perceive that he is strange indeed though that seems to me And I warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you and upon either side You mean the Riders I feared that they were servants of the Enemy What _are_ the Black Riders Has Gandalf told you nothing Nothing about such creatures Then I think it is not for me to say more lest terror should keep you from your journey For it seems to me that you have set out only just in time if indeed you are in time You must now make haste and neither stay nor turn back for the Shire is no longer any protection to you I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your hints and warnings exclaimed Frodo I knew that danger lay ahead of course but I did not expect to meet it in our own Shire Cant a hobbit walk from the Water to the River in peace But it is not your own Shire said Gildor Others dwelt here before hobbits were and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more The wide world is all about you you can fence yourselves in but you cannot for ever fence it out I know and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar What can I do now My plan was to leave the Shire secretly and make my way to Rivendell but now my footsteps are dogged before ever I get to Buckland I think you should still follow that plan said Gildor I do not think the Road will prove too hard for your courage But if you desire clearer counsel you should ask Gandalf I do not know the reason for your flight and therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you These things Gandalf must know I suppose that you will see him before you leave the Shire I hope so But that is another thing that makes me anxious I have been expecting Gandalf for many days He was to have come to Hobbiton at the latest two nights ago but he has never appeared Now I am wondering what can have happened Should I wait for him Gildor was silent for a moment I do not like this news he said at last That Gandalf should be late does not bode well But it is said _Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger_ The choice is yours to go or wait And it is also said answered Frodo Go _not to the Elves for counsel for they will say both no and yes_ Is it indeed laughed Gildor Elves seldom give unguarded advice for advice is a dangerous gift even from the wise to the wise and all courses may run ill But what would you You have not told me all concerning yourself and how then shall I choose better than you But if you demand advice I will for friendships sake give it I think you should now go at once without delay and if Gandalf does not come before you set out then I also advise this do not go alone Take such friends as are trusty and willing Now you should be grateful for I do not give this counsel gladly The Elves have their own labours and their own sorrows and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits or of any other creatures upon earth Our paths cross theirs seldom by chance or purpose In this meeting there may be more than chance but the purpose is not clear to me and I fear to say too much I am deeply grateful said Frodo but I wish you would tell me plainly what the Black Riders are If I take your advice I may not see Gandalf for a long while and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy answered Gildor Flee them Speak no words to them They are deadly Ask no more of me But my heart forbodes that ere all is ended you Frodo son of Drogo will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion May Elbereth protect you But where shall I find courage asked Frodo That is what I chiefly need Courage is found in unlikely places said Gildor Be of good hope Sleep now In the morning we shall have gone but we will send our messages through the lands The Wandering Companies shall know of your journey and those that have power for good shall be on the watch I name you Elffriend and may the stars shine upon the end of your road Seldom have we had such delight in strangers and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient Speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world Frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as Gildor finished speaking I will sleep now he said and the Elf led him to a bower beside Pippin and he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber _Chapter 4_ A Short Cut to Mushrooms In the morning Frodo woke refreshed He was lying in a bower made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground his bed was of fern and grass deep and soft and strangely fragrant The sun was shining through the fluttering leaves which were still green upon the tree He jumped up and went out Sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood Pippin was standing studying the sky and weather There was no sign of the Elves They have left us fruit and drink and bread said Pippin Come and have your breakfast The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night I did not want to leave you any but Sam insisted Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat What is the plan for today asked Pippin To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible answered Frodo and gave his attention to the food Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders asked Pippin cheerfully Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to him Yes probably said Frodo not liking the reminder But I hope to get across the river without their seeing us Did you find out anything about them from Gildor Not much only hints and riddles said Frodo evasively Did you ask about the sniffing We didnt discuss it said Frodo with his mouth full You should have I am sure it is very important In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it said Frodo sharply And now leave me in peace for a bit I dont want to answer a string of questions while I am eating I want to think Good heavens said Pippin At breakfast He walked away towards the edge of the green From Frodos mind the bright morning treacherously bright he thought had not banished the fear of pursuit and he pondered the words of Gildor The merry voice of Pippin came to him He was running on the green turf and singing No I could not he said to himself It is one thing to take my young friends walking over the Shire with me until we are hungry and weary and food and bed are sweet To take them into exile where hunger and weariness may have no cure is quite another even if they are willing to come The inheritance is mine alone I dont think I ought even to take Sam He looked at Sam Gamgee and discovered that Sam was watching him Well Sam he said What about it I am leaving the Shire as soon as ever I can in fact I have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at Crickhollow if it can be helped Very good sir You still mean to come with me I do It is going to be very dangerous Sam It is already dangerous Most likely neither of us will come back If you dont come back sir then I shant thats certain said Sam _Dont you leave him_ they said to me _Leave him_ I said _I never mean to I am going with him if he climbs to the Moon and if any of those Black Rulers try to stop him theyll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with_ I said They laughed Who are _they_ and what are you talking about The Elves sir We had some talk last night and they seemed to know you were going away so I didnt see the use of denying it Wonderful folk Elves sir Wonderful They are said Frodo Do you like them still now you have had a closer view They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes so to speak answered Sam slowly It dont seem to matter what I think about them They are quite different from what I expected so old and young and so gay and sad as it were Frodo looked at Sam rather startled half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him It did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew But it looked like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there except that his face was unusually thoughtful Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now now that your wish to see them has come true already he asked Yes sir I dont know how to say it but after last night I feel different I seem to see ahead in a kind of way I know we are going to take a very long road into darkness but I know I cant turn back It isnt to see Elves now nor dragons nor mountains that I want I dont rightly know what I want but I have something to do before the end and it lies ahead not in the Shire I must see it through sir if you understand me I dont altogether But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion I am content We will go together Frodo finished his breakfast in silence Then standing up he looked over the land ahead and called to Pippin All ready to start he said as Pippin ran up We must be getting off at once We slept late and there are a good many miles to go _You_ slept late you mean said Pippin I was up long before and we are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking I have finished both now And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible I am not going out of the way back to the road we left last night I am going to cut straight across country from here Then you are going to fly said Pippin You wont cut straight on foot anywhere in this country We can cut straighter than the road anyway answered Frodo The Ferry is east from Woodhall but the hard road curves away to the left you can see a bend of it away north over there It goes round the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock But that is miles out of the way We could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry from where we stand _Short cuts make long delays_ argued Pippin The country is rough round here and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the Marish I know the land in these parts And if you are worrying about Black Riders I cant see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a field It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields answered Frodo And if you are supposed to be on the road there is some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it All right said Pippin I will follow you into every bog and ditch But it is hard I had counted on passing the _Golden Perch_ at Stock before sundown The best beer in the Eastfarthing or used to be it is a long time since I tasted it That settles it said Frodo Short cuts make delays but inns make longer ones At all costs we must keep you away from the _Golden Perch_ We want to get to Bucklebury before dark What do you say Sam I will go along with you Mr Frodo said Sam in spite of private misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar lets go now said Pippin It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before but clouds were beginning to come up from the West It looked likely to turn to rain The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees below Their course had been chosen to leave Woodhall to their left and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side of the hills until they reached the flats beyond Then they could make straight for the Ferry over country that was open except for a few ditches and fences Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had appeared There were no paths in the undergrowth and they did not get on very fast When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank they found a stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles Most inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen They could not jump over it nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet scratched and muddy They halted wondering what to do First check said Pippin smiling grimly Sam Gamgee looked back Through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down Look he said clutching Frodo by the arm They all looked and on the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing Beside it stooped a black figure They at once gave up any idea of going back Frodo led the way and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream Whew he said to Pippin We were both right The short cut has gone crooked already but we got under cover only just in time Youve got sharp ears Sam can you hear anything coming They stood still almost holding their breath as they listened but there was no sound of pursuit I dont fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said Sam But I guess he knows we came down it We had better be going on Going on was not altogether easy They had packs to carry and the bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through They were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind and the air was still and stuffy When they forced their way at last into more open ground they were hot and tired and very scratched and they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going The banks of the stream sank as it reached the levels and became broader and shallower wandering off towards the Marish and the River Why this is the Stockbrook said Pippin If we are going to try and get back on to our course we must cross at once and bear right They waded the stream and hurried over a wide open space rushgrown and treeless on the further side Beyond that they came again to a belt of trees tall oaks for the most part with here and there an elm tree or an ash The ground was fairly level and there was little undergrowth but the trees were loo close for them to see far ahead The leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky Then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down They trudged along as fast as they could over patches of grass and through thick drifts of old leaves and all about them the rain pattered and trickled They did not talk but kept glancing back and from side to side After half an hour Pippin said I hope we have not turned too much towards the south and are not walking longwise through this wood It is not a very broad belt I should have said no more than a mile at the widest and we ought to have been through it by now It is no good our starting to go in zigzags said Frodo That wont mend matters Let us keep on as we are going I am not sure that I want to come out into the open yet They went on for perhaps another couple of miles Then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened It was now past midday and they felt it was high time for lunch They halted under an elm tree its leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick and the ground at its feel was fairly dry and sheltered When they came to make their meal they found that the Elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink pale golden in colour it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers and was wonderfully refreshing Very soon they were laughing and snapping their fingers at rain and at Black Riders The last few miles they felt would soon be behind them Frodo propped his back against the treetrunk and closed his eyes Sam and Pippin sat near and they began to hum and then to sing softly Ho Ho Ho to the bottle I go To heal my heart and drown my woe Rain may fall and wind may blow And many miles be still to go But under a tall tree I will lie And let the clouds go sailing by _Ho Ho Ho_ they began again louder They stopped short suddenly Frodo sprang to his feet A longdrawn wail came down the wind like the cry of some evil and lonely creature It rose and fell and ended on a high piercing note Even as they sat and stood as if suddenly frozen it was answered by another cry fainter and further off but no less chilling to the blood There was then a silence broken only by the sound of the wind in the leaves And what do you think that was Pippin asked at last trying to speak lightly but quavering a little If it was a bird it was one that I never heard in the Shire before It was not bird or beast said Frodo It was a call or a signal there were words in that cry though I could not catch them But no hobbit has such a voice No more was said about it They were all thinking of the Riders but no one spoke of them They were now reluctant either to stay or go on but sooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the Ferry and it was best to go sooner and in daylight In a few moments they had shouldered their packs again and were off Before long the wood came to a sudden end Wide grasslands stretched before them They now saw that they had in fact turned too much to the south Away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury across the River but it was now to their left Creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees they set off across the open as quickly as they could At first they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood Far back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted Frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky but there was no sign of one The sun escaping from the breaking clouds as it sank towards the hills they had left was now shining brightly again Their fear left them though they still felt uneasy But the land became steadily more tame and wellordered Soon they came into welltended fields and meadows there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage Everything seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordinary corner of the Shire Their spirits rose with every step The line of the River grew nearer and the Black Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left far behind They passed along the edge of a huge turnipfield and came to a stout gate Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low welllaid hedges towards a distant clump of trees Pippin stopped I know these fields and this gate he said This is Bamfurlong old Farmer Maggots land Thats his farm away there in the trees One trouble after another said Frodo looking nearly as much alarmed as if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragons den The others looked at him in surprise Whats wrong with old Maggot asked Pippin Hes a good friend to all the Brandy bucks Of course hes a terror to trespassers and keeps ferocious dogs but after all folk down here are near the border and have to be more on their guard I know said Frodo But all the same he added with a shamefaced laugh I am terrified of him and his dogs I have avoided his farm for years and years He caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall On the last occasion he beat me and then took me and showed me to his dogs See lads he said next time this young varmint sets foot on my land you can eat him Now see him off They chased me all the way to the Ferry I have never got over the fright though I daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have touched me Pippin laughed Well its time you made it up Especially if you are coming back to live in Buckland Old Maggot is really a stout fellow if you leave his mushrooms alone Lets get into the lane and then we shant be trespassing If we meet him Ill do the talking He is a friend of Merrys and I used to come here with him a good deal at one time They went along the lane until they saw the thatched roofs of a large house and farmbuildings peeping out among the trees ahead The Maggots and the Puddifoots of Stock and most of the inhabitants of the Marish were housedwellers and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane Suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out and a loud voice was heard shouting Grip Fang Wolf Come on lads Frodo and Sam stopped dead but Pippin walked on a few paces The gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane and dashed towards the travellers barking fiercely They took no notice of Pippin but Sam shrank against the wall while two wolvishlooking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously and snarled if he moved The largest and most ferocious of the three halted in front of Frodo bristling and growling Through the gate there now appeared a broad thickset hobbit with a round red face Hallo Hallo And who may you be and what may you be wanting he asked Good afternoon Mr Maggot said Pippin The farmer looked at him closely Well if it isnt Master Pippin Mr Peregrin Took I should say he cried changing from a scowl to a grin Its a long time since I saw you round here Its lucky for you that I know you I was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers There are some funny things going on today Of course we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times Too near the River he said shaking his head But this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes on He wont cross my land without leave a second time not if I can stop it What fellow do you mean asked Pippin Then you havent seen him said the farmer He went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back He was a funny customer and asking funny questions But perhaps youll come along inside and well pass the news more comfortable Ive a drop of good ale on tap if you and your friends are willing Mr Took It seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more if allowed to do it in his own time and fashion so they all accepted the invitation What about the dogs asked Frodo anxiously The farmer laughed They wont harm you not unless I tell em to Here Grip Fang Heel he cried Heel Wolf To the relief of Frodo and Sam the dogs walked away and let them go free Pippin introduced the other two to the farmer Mr Frodo Baggins he said You may not remember him but he used to live at Brandy Hall At the name Baggins the farmer started and gave Frodo a sharp glance For a moment Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused and that the dogs would be told to see him off But Farmer Maggot took him by the arm Well if that isnt queerer than ever he exclaimed Mr Baggins is it Come inside We must have a talk They went into the farmers kitchen and sat by the wide fireplace Mrs Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug and filled four large mugs It was a good brew and Pippin found himself more than compensated for missing the _Golden Perch_ Sam sipped his beer suspiciously He had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire and also he was not disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master however long ago After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects which were no worse than usual Farmer Maggot put down his mug and looked at them all in turn Now Mr Peregrin he said where might you be coming from and where might you be going to Were you coming to visit me For if so you had gone past my gate without my seeing you Well no answered Pippin To tell you the truth since you have guessed it we got into the lane from the other end we had come over your fields But that was quite by accident We lost our way in the woods back near Woodhall trying to take a short cut to the Ferry If you were in a hurry the road would have served you better said the farmer But I wasnt worrying about that You have leave to walk over my land if you have a mind Mr Peregrin And you Mr Baggins though I daresay you still like mushrooms He laughed Ah yes I recognized the name I recollect the time when young Frodo Baggins was one of the worst young rascals of Buckland But it wasnt mushrooms I was thinking of I had just heard the name Baggins before you turned up What do you think that funny customer asked me They waited anxiously for him to go on Well the farmer continued approaching his point with slow relish he came riding on a big black horse in at the gate which happened to be open and right up to my door All black he was himself too and cloaked and hooded up as if he did not want to be known Now what in the Shire can he want I thought to myself We dont see many of the Big Folk over the border and anyway I had never heard of any like this black fellow Goodday to you I says going out to him This lane dont lead anywhere and wherever you may be going your quickest way will be back to the road I didnt like the looks of him and when Grip came out he took one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been slung he put down his tail and bolted off howling The black fellow sat quite still I come from yonder he said slow and stifflike pointing back west over _my_ fields if you please Have you seen _Baggins_ he asked in a queer voice and bent down towards me I could not see any face for his hood fell down so low and I felt a sort of shiver down my back But I did not see why he should come riding over my land so bold Be off I said There are no Bagginses here Youre in the wrong part of the Shire You had better go back west to Hobbiton but you can go by road this time Baggins has left he answered in a whisper He is coming He is not far away I wish to find him If he passes will you tell me I will come back with gold No you wont I said Youll go back where you belong double quick I give you one minute before I call all my dogs He gave a sort of hiss It might have been laughing and it might not Then he spurred his great horse right at me and I jumped out of the way only just in time I called the dogs but he swung off and rode through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder What do you think of that Frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire but his only thought was how on earth would they reach the Ferry I dont know what to think he said at last Then Ill tell you what to think said Maggot You should never have gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk Mr Frodo Folk are queer up there Sam stirred in his chair and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly eye But you were always a reckless lad When I heard you had left the Brandybucks and gone off to that old Mr Bilbo I said that you were going to find trouble Mark my words this all comes of those strange doings of Mr Bilbos His money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts they say Maybe there is some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton as I hear Frodo said nothing the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting Well Mr Frodo Maggot went on Im glad that youve had the sense to come back to Buckland My advice is stay there And dont get mixed up with these outlandish folk Youll have friends in these parts If any of these black fellows come after you again Ill deal with them Ill say youre dead or have left the Shire or anything you like And that might be true enough for as like as not it is old Mr Bilbo they want news of Maybe youre right said Frodo avoiding the farmers eye and staring at the fire Maggot looked at him thoughtfully Well I see you have ideas of your own he said It is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and that rider here on the same afternoon and maybe my news was no great news to you after all I am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind to keep to yourself but I see you are in some kind of trouble Perhaps you are thinking it wont be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught I was thinking so said Frodo But we have got to try and get there and it wont be done by sitting and thinking So I am afraid we must be going Thank you very much indeed for your kindness Ive been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years Farmer Maggot though you may laugh to hear it Its a pity for Ive missed a good friend And now Im sorry to leave so soon But Ill come back perhaps one day if I get a chance Youll be welcome when you come said Maggot But now Ive a notion Its near sundown already and we are going to have our supper for we mostly go to bed soon after the Sun If you and Mr Peregrin and all could stay and have a bite with us we would be pleased And so should we said Frodo But we must be going at once Im afraid Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry Ah but wait a minute I was going to say after a bit of supper Ill gel out a small waggon and Ill drive you all to the Ferry That will save you a good step and it might also save you trouble of another sort Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully to the relief of Pippin and Sam The sun was already behind the western hills and the light was failing Two of Maggots sons and his three daughters came in and a generous supper was laid on the large table The kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended Mrs Maggot hustled in and out One or two other hobbits belonging to the farmhousehold came in In a short while fourteen sat down to eat There was beer in plenty and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon besides much other solid farmhouse fare The dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones When they had finished the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern and got the waggon ready It was dark in the yard when the guests came out They threw their packs on board and climbed in The farmer sat in the drivingseat and whipped up his two stout ponies His wife stood in the light of the open door You be careful of yourself Maggot she called Dont go arguing with any foreigners and come straight back I will said he and drove out of the gate There was now no breath of wind stirring the night was still and quiet and a chill was in the air They went without lights and took it slowly After a mile or two the lane came to an end crossing a deep dike and climbing a short slope up on to the highbanked causeway Maggot got down and took a good look either way north and south but nothing could be seen in the darkness and there was not a sound in the still air Thin strands of rivermist were hanging above the dikes and crawling over the fields Its going to be thick said Maggot but Ill not light my lantern till I turn for home Well hear anything on the road long before we meet it tonight It was five miles or more from Maggots lane to the Ferry The hobbits wrapped themselves up but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow _clop_ of the ponies hoofs The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo Beside him Pippin was nodding towards sleep but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last It was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right Farmer Maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt They were just beginning lo scramble out when suddenly they heard what they had all been dreading hoofs on the road ahead The sound was coming towards them Maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies heads and peering forward into the gloom _Clipclop clipclop_ came the approaching rider The fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still foggy air Youd better be hidden Mr Frodo said Sam anxiously You get down in the waggon and cover up with blankets and well send this rider to the rightabouts He climbed out and went to the farmers side Black Riders would have to ride over him to get near the waggon _Clopclop clopclop_ The rider was nearly on them Hallo there called Farmer Maggot The advancing hoofs stopped short They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist a yard or two ahead Now then said the farmer throwing the reins to Sam and striding forward Dont you come a step nearer What do you want and where are you going I want Mr Baggins Have you seen him said a muffled voice but the voice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck A dark lantern was uncovered and its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer Mr Merry he cried Yes of course Who did you think it was said Merry coming forward As he came out of the mist and their fears subsided he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbitsize He was riding a pony and a scarf was swathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog Frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him So there you are at last said Merry I was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all today and I was just going back to supper When it grew foggy I came across and rode up towards Stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches But Im blest if I know which way you have come Where did you find them Mr Maggot In your duckpond No I caught em trespassing said the farmer and nearly set my dogs on em but theyll tell you all the story Ive no doubt Now if youll excuse me Mr Merry and Mr Frodo and all Id best be turning for home Mrs Maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it Well good night to you all he said Its been a queer day and no mistake But alls well as ends well though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors Ill not deny that Ill be glad now when I do He lit his lanterns and got up Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat I was nearly forgetting he said Mrs Maggot put this up for Mr Baggins with her compliments He handed it down and moved off followed by a chorus of thanks and goodnights They watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they dwindled into the foggy night Suddenly Frodo laughed from the covered basket he held the scent of mushrooms was rising _Chapter 5_ A Conspiracy Unmasked Now we had better get home ourselves said Merry Theres something funny about all this I see but it must wait till we get in They turned down the Ferry lane which was straight and wellkept and edged with large whitewashed stones In a hundred yards or so it brought them to the riverbank where there was a broad wooden landingstage A large flat ferryboat was moored beside it The white bollards near the waters edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts Behind them the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges but the water before them was dark with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank There seemed to be less fog on the further side Merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry and the others followed Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole The Brandywine flowed slow and broad before them On the other side the bank was steep and up it a winding path climbed from the further landing Lamps were twinkling there Behind loomed up the Buck Hill and out of it through stray shrouds of mist shone many round windows yellow and red They were the windows of Brandy Hall the ancient home of the Brandybucks Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck head of the Oldbuck family one of the oldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire had crossed the river which was the original boundary of the land eastwards He built and excavated Brandy Hall changed his name to Brandybuck and settled down to become master of what was virtually a small independent country His family grew and grew and after his days continued to grow until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the low hill and had three large frontdoors many sidedoors and about a hundred windows The Brandybucks and their numerous dependants then began to burrow and later to build all round about That was the origin of Buckland a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old Forest a sort of colony from the Shire Its chief village was Bucklebury clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall The people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders and the authority of the Master of the Hall as the head of the Brandybuck family was called was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey But most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar half foreigners as it were Though as a matter of fact they were not very different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings Except in one point they were fond of boats and some of them could swim Their land was originally unprotected from the East but on that side they had built a hedge the High Hay It had been planted many generations ago and was now thick and tail for it was constantly tended It ran all the way from Brandywine Bridge in a big loop curving away from the river to Haysend where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the Brandywine well over twenty miles from end to end But of course it was not a complete protection The Forest drew close to the hedge in many places The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark and that also was not usual in the Shire The ferryboat moved slowly across the water The Buckland shore drew nearer Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river before He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by his old life lay behind in the mists dark adventure lay in front He scratched his head and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr Frodo could have gone on living quietly at Bag End The four hobbits stepped off the ferry Merry was tying it up and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path when Sam who had been looking back as if to take farewell of the Shire said in a hoarse whisper Look back Mr Frodo Do you see anything On the far stage under the distant lamps they could just make out a figure it looked like a dark black bundle left behind But as they looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that as if searching the ground It then crawled or went crouching back into the gloom beyond the lamps What in the Shire is that exclaimed Merry Something that is following us said Frodo But dont ask any more now Lets get away at once They hurried up the path to the top of the bank but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seen Thank goodness you dont keep any boats on the westbank said Frodo Can horses cross the river They can go twenty miles north to Brandywine Bridge or they might swim answered Merry Though I never heard of any horse swimming the Brandywine But what have horses to do with it Ill tell you later Lets get indoors and then we can talk All right You and Pippin know your way so Ill just ride on and tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming Well see about supper and things We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot said Frodo but we could do with another You shall have it Give me that basket said Merry and rode ahead into the darkness It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodos new house at Crickhollow They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left and on the outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from the Bridge Half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on their right This they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and down into the country At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge Nothing could be seen of the house in the dark it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedge Frodo had chosen it because it stood in an outoftheway corner of the country and there were no other dwellings close by You could get in and out without being noticed It had been built a long while before by the Brandybucks for the use of guests or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of Brandy Hall for a time It was an oldfashioned countrified house as much like a hobbithole as possible it was long and low with no upper storey and it had a roof of turf round windows and a large round door As they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible the windows were dark and shuttered Frodo knocked on the door and Fatty Bolger opened it A friendly light streamed out They slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside They were in a wide hall with doors on either side in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the house Well what do you think of it asked Merry coming up the passage We have done our best in a short time to make it look like home After all Fatty and I only got here with the last cartload yesterday Frodo looked round It did look like home Many of his own favourite things or Bilbos things they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End It was a pleasant comfortable welcoming place and he found himself wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement It seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon indeed at once Yet that would have to be done that very night before they all went to bed Its delightful he said with an effort I hardly feel that I have moved at all The travellers hung up their cloaks and piled their packs on the floor Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end Firelight came out and a puff of steam A bath cried Pippin O blessed Meriadoc Which order shall we go in said Frodo Eldest first or quickest first Youll be last either way Master Peregrin Trust me to arrange things better than that said Merry We cant begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths In that room there are _three_ tubs and a copper full of boiling water There are also towels mats and soap Get inside and be quick Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage and busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound of splashing and wallowing The voice of Pippin was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of Bilbos favourite bathsongs Sing hey for the bath at close of day that washes the weary mud away A loon is he that will not sing O Water Hot is a noble thing O Sweet is the sound of falling rain and the brook that leaps from hill to plain but better than rain or rippling streams is Water Hot that smokes and steams O Water cold we may pour at need down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed but better is Beer if drink we lack and Water Hot poured down the back O Water is fair that leaps on high in a fountain white beneath the sky but never did fountain sound so sweet as splashing Hot Water with my feet There was a terrific splash and a shout of _Whoa_ from Frodo It appeared that a lot of Pippins bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on high Merry went to the door What about supper and beer in the throat he called Frodo came out drying his hair Theres so much water in the air that Im coming into the kitchen to finish he said Lawks said Merry looking in The stone floor was swimming You ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat Peregrin he said Hurry up or we shant wait for you They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire I suppose you three wont want mushrooms again said Fredegar without much hope Yes we shall cried Pippin Theyre mine said Frodo Given to _me_ by Mrs Maggot a queen among farmers wives Take your greedy hands away and Ill serve them Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms surpassing even the greediest likings of Big People A fact which partly explains young Frodos long expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish and the wrath of the injured Maggot On this occasion there was plenty for all even according to hobbit standards There were also many other things to follow and when they had finished even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh of content They pushed back the table and drew chairs round the fire Well clear up later said Merry Now tell me all about it I guess that you have been having adventures which was not quite fair without me I want a full account and most of all I want to know what was the matter with old Maggot and why he spoke to me like that He sounded almost as if he was _scared_ if that is possible We have all been scared said Pippin after a pause in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not speak You would have been too if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders And what are they Black figures riding on black horses answered Pippin If Frodo wont talk I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning He then gave a full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations Frodo remained silent I should think you were making it all up said Merry if I had not seen that black shape on the landingstage and heard the queer sound in Maggots voice What do you make of it all Frodo Cousin Frodo has been very close said Pippin But the time has come for him to open out So far we have been given nothing more to go on than Farmer Maggots guess that it has something to do with old Bilbos treasure That was only a guess said Frodo hastily Maggot does not _know_anything Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow said Merry A lot goes on behind his round face that does not come out in his talk Ive heard that he used to go into the Old Forest at one time and he has the reputation of knowing a good many strange things But you can at least tell us Frodo whether you think his guess good or bad I _think_ answered Frodo slowly that it was a good guess as far as it goes There _is a_ connexion with Bilbos old adventures and the Riders are looking or perhaps one ought to say _searching_ for him or for me I also fear if you want to know that it is no joke at all and that I am not safe here or anywhere else He looked round at the windows and walls as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way The others looked at him in silence and exchanged meaning glances among themselves Its coming out in a minute whispered Pippin to Merry Merry nodded Well said Frodo at last sitting up and straightening his back as if he had made a decision I cant keep it dark any longer I have got something to tell you all But I dont know quite how to begin I think I could help you said Merry quietly by telling you some of it myself What do you mean said Frodo looking at him anxiously Just this my dear old Frodo you are miserable because you dont know how to say goodbye You meant to leave the Shire of course But danger has come on you sooner than you expected and now you are making up your mind to go at once And you dont want to We are very sorry for you Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again His look of surprise was so comical that they laughed Dear old Frodo said Pippin Did you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes You have not been nearly careful or clever enough for that You have obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since April We have constantly heard you muttering Shall I ever look down into that valley again I wonder and things like that And pretending that you had come to the end of your money and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those SackvilleBagginses And all those close talks with Gandalf Good heavens said Frodo I thought I had been both careful and clever I dont know what Gandalf would say Is all the Shire discussing my departure then Oh no said Merry Dont worry about that The secret wont keep for long of course but at present it is I think only known to us conspirators After all you must remember that we know you well and are often with you We can usually guess what you are thinking I knew Bilbo too To tell you the truth I had been watching you rather closely ever since he left I thought you would go after him sooner or later indeed I expected you to go sooner and lately we have been very anxious We have been terrified that you might give us the slip and go off suddenly all on your own like he did Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open and done a good deal of planning on our own account You are not going to escape so easily But I must go said Frodo It cannot be helped dear friends It is wretched for us all but it is no use your trying to keep me Since you have guessed so much please help me and do not hinder me You do not understand said Pippin You must go and therefore we must too Merry and I are coming with you Sam is an excellent fellow and would jump down a dragons throat to save you if he did not trip over his own feet but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous adventure My dear and most beloved hobbits said Frodo deeply moved But I could not allow it I decided that long ago too You speak of danger but you do not understand This is no treasurehunt no thereandback journey I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril Of course we understand said Merry firmly That is why we have decided to come We know the Ring is no laughingmatter but we are going to do our best to help you against the Enemy The Ring said Frodo now completely amazed Yes the Ring said Merry My dear old hobbit you dont allow for the inquisitiveness of friends I have known about the existence of the Ring for years before Bilbo went away in fact but since he obviously regarded it as secret I kept the knowledge in my head until we formed our conspiracy I did not know Bilbo of course as well as I know you I was too young and he was also more careful but he was not careful enough If you want to know how I first found out I will tell you Go on said Frodo faintly It was the SackvilleBagginses that were his downfall as you might expect One day a year before the Party I happened to be walking along the road when I saw Bilbo ahead Suddenly in the distance the SBs appeared coming towards us Bilbo slowed down and then hey presto he vanished I was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion but I got through the hedge and walked along the field inside I was peeping through into the road after the SBs had passed and was looking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared I caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouserpocket After that I kept my eyes open In fact I confess that I spied But you must admit that it was very intriguing and I was only in my teens I must be the only one in the Shire besides you Frodo that has ever seen the old fellows secret book You have read his book cried Frodo Good heavens above Is nothing safe Not too safe I should say said Merry But I have only had one rapid glance and that was difficult to get He never left the book about I wonder what became of it I should like another look Have you got it Frodo No It was not at Bag End He must have taken it away Well as I was saying Merry proceeded I kept my knowledge to myself till this Spring when things got serious Then we formed our conspiracy and as we were serious too and meant business we have not been too scrupulous You are not a very easy nut to crack and Gandalf is worse But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator I can produce him Where is he said Frodo looking round as if he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard Step forward Sam said Merry and Sam stood up with a face scarlet up to the ears Heres our collector of information And he collected a lot I can tell you before he was finally caught After which I may say he seemed to regard himself as on parole and dried up Sam cried Frodo feeling that amazement could go no further and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry amused relieved or merely foolish Yes sir said Sam Begging your pardon sir But I meant no wrong to you Mr Frodo nor to Mr Gandalf for that matter _He_ has some sense mind you and when you said _go alone_ he said _no lake someone as you can trust_ But it does not seem that I can trust anyone said Frodo Sam looked at him unhappily It all depends on what you want put in Merry You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin to the bitter end And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours closer than you keep it yourself But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone and go off without a word We are your friends Frodo Anyway there it is We know most of what Gandalf has told you We know a good deal about the Ring We are horribly afraid but we are coming with you or following you like hounds And after all sir added Sam you did ought to take the Elves advice Gildor said you should take them as was willing and you cant deny it I dont deny it said Frodo looking at Sam who was now grinning I dont deny it but Ill never believe you are sleeping again whether you snore or not I shall kick you hard to make sure You are a set of deceitful scoundrels he said turning to the others But bless you he laughed getting up and waving his arms I give in I will take Gildors advice If the danger were not so dark I should dance for joy Even so I cannot help feeling happy happier than I have felt for a long time I had dreaded this evening Good Thats settled Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company they shouted and they danced round him Merry and Pippin began a song which they had apparently got ready for the occasion It was made on the model of the dwarfsong that started Bilbo on his adventure long ago and went to the same tune Farewell we call to hearth and hall Though wind may blow and rain may fall We must away ere break of day Far over wood and mountain tall To Rivendell where Elves yet dwell In glades beneath the misty fell Through moor and waste we ride in haste And whither then we cannot tell With foes ahead behind us dread Beneath the sky shall be our bed Until at last our toil be passed Our journey done our errand sped We must away We must away We ride before the break of day Very good said Frodo But in that case there are a lot of things to do before we go to bed under a roof for tonight at any rate Oh That was poetry said Pippin Do you really mean to start before the break of day I dont know answered Frodo I fear those Black Riders and I am sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long especially in a place to which it is known I was going Also Gildor advised me not to wait But I should very much like to see Gandalf I could see that even Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared It really depends on two things How soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury And how soon could we get off It will take a good deal of preparation The answer to the second question said Merry is that we could get off in an hour I have prepared practically everything There are six ponies in a stable across the fields stores and tackle are all packed except for a few extra clothes and the perishable food It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy said Frodo But what about the Black Riders Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf That all depends on what you think the Riders would do if they found you here answered Merry They _could_ have reached here by now of course if they were not stopped at the Northgate where the Hedge runs down to the riverbank just this side of the Bridge The gateguards would not let them through by night though they might break through Even in the daylight they would try to keep them out I think at any rate until they got a message through to the Master of the Hall for they would not like the look of the Riders and would certainly be frightened by them But of course Buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long And it is possible that in the morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr Baggins would be let through It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at Crickhollow Frodo sat for a while in thought I have made up my mind he said finally I am starting tomorrow as soon as it is light But I am not going by road it would be safer to wait here than that If I go through the Northgate my departure from Buckland will be known at once instead of being secret for several days at least as it might be And what is more the Bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not We dont know how many there are but there are at least two and possibly more The only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction But that can only mean going into the Old Forest said Fredegar horrified You cant be thinking of doing that It is quite as dangerous as Black Riders Not quite said Merry It sounds very desperate but I believe Frodo is right It is the only way of getting off without being followed at once With luck we might gel a considerable start But you wont have any luck in the Old Forest objected Fredegar No one ever has luck in there Youll gel lost People dont go in there Oh yes they do said Merry The Brandybucks go in occasionally when the fit takes them We have a private entrance Frodo went in once long ago I have been in several times usually in daylight of course when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet Well do as you think best said Fredegar I am more afraid of the Old Forest than of anything I know about the stories about it are a nightmare but my vote hardly counts as I am not going on the journey Still I am very glad someone is stopping behind who can tell Gandalf what you have done when he turns up as I am sure he will before long Fond as he was of Frodo Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire nor to see what lay outside it His family came from the Eastfarthing from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact but he had never been over the Brandywine Bridge His task according to the original plans of the conspirators was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk and to keep up as long as possible the pretence that Mr Baggins was still living at Crickhollow He had even brought along some old clothes of Frodos to help him in playing the part They little thought how dangerous that part might prove Excellent said Frodo when he understood the plan We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise I dont know whether these Riders can read or not of course but I should not have dared to risk a written message in case they got in and searched the house But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we have gone that decides me I am going into the Old Forest first thing tomorrow Well thats that said Pippin On the whole I would rather have our job than Fattys waiting here till Black Riders come You wait till you are well inside the Forest said Fredegar Youll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow Its no good arguing about it any more said Merry We have still got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing before we get to bed I shall call you all before the break of day When at last he had got to bed Frodo could not sleep for some time His legs ached He was glad that he was riding in the morning Eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees Down below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling He felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later Then he heard a noise in the distance At first he thought it was a great wind coming over the leaves of the forest Then he knew that it was not leaves but the sound of the Sea faroff a sound he had never heard in waking life though it had often troubled his dreams Suddenly he found he was out in the open There were no trees after all He was on a dark heath and there was a strange salt smell in the air Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower standing alone on a high ridge A great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the Sea He started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower but suddenly a light came in the sky and there was a noise of thunder _Chapter 6_ The Old Forest Frodo woke suddenly It was still dark in the room Merry was standing there with a candle in one hand and banging on the door with the other All right What is it said Frodo still shaken and bewildered What is it cried Merry It is time to get up It is half past four and very foggy Come on Sam is already getting breakfast ready Even Pippin is up I am just going to saddle the ponies and fetch the one that is to be the baggagecarrier Wake that sluggard Fatty At least he must get up and see us off Soon after six oclock the five hobbits were ready to start Fatty Bolger was still yawning They stole quietly out of the house Merry went in front leading a laden pony and took his way along a path that went through a spinney behind the house and then cut across several fields The leaves of trees were glistening and every twig was dripping the grass was grey with cold dew Everything was still and faraway noises seemed near and clear fowls chattering in a yard someone closing a door of a distant house In their shed they found the ponies sturdy little beasts of the kind loved by hobbits not speedy but good for a long days work They mounted and soon they were riding off into the mist which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them After riding for about an hour slowly and without talking they saw the Hedge looming suddenly ahead It was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs How are you going to get through this asked Fredegar Follow me said Merry and you will see He turned to the left along the Hedge and soon they came to a point where it bent inwards running along the lip of a hollow A cutting had been made at some distance from the Hedge and went sloping gently down into the ground It had walls of brick at the sides which rose steadily until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side Here Fatty Bolger halted Goodbye Frodo he said I wish you were not going into the Forest I only hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out But good luck to you today and every day If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest I shall be lucky said Frodo Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can Goodbye they cried and rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegars sight into the tunnel It was dark and damp At the far end it was closed by a gate of thickset iron bars Merry got down and unlocked the gate and when they had all passed through he pushed it to again It shut with a clang and the lock clicked The sound was ominous There said Merry You have left the Shire and are now outside and on the edge of the Old Forest Are the stories about it true asked Pippin I dont know what stories you mean Merry answered If you mean the old bogeystories Fattys nurses used to tell him about goblins and wolves and things of that sort I should say no At any rate I dont believe them But the Forest _is_ queer Everything in it is very much more alive more aware of what is going on so to speak than things are in the Shire And the trees do not like strangers They watch you They are usually content merely to watch you as long as daylight lasts and dont do much Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or stick a root out or grasp at you with a long trailer But at night things can be most alarming or so I am told I have only once or twice been in here after dark and then only near the hedge I thought all the trees were whispering to each other passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language and the branches swayed and groped without any wind They do say the trees do actually move and can surround strangers and hem them in In fact long ago they attacked the Hedge they came and planted themselves right by it and leaned over it But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees and made a great bonfire in the Forest and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the Hedge After that the trees gave up the attack but they became very unfriendly There is still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire was made Is it only the trees that are dangerous asked Pippin There are various queer things living deep in the Forest and on the far side said Merry or at least I have heard so but I have never seen any of them But something makes paths Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion Not far from this tunnel there is or was for a long time the beginning of quite a broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade and then on more or less in our direction east and a little north That is the path I am going to try and find The hobbits now left the tunnelgate and rode across the wide hollow On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest a hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees Looking back they could see the dark line of the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them Looking ahead they could see only treetrunks of innumerable sizes and shapes straight or bent twisted leaning squat or slender smooth or gnarled and branched and all the stems were green or grey with moss and slimy shaggy growths Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful You had better lead on and find that path Frodo said to him Dont let us lose one another or forget which way the Hedge lies They picked a way among the trees and their ponies plodded along carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots There was no undergrowth The ground was rising steadily and as they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller darker and thicker There was no sound except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leaves For the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval deepening to dislike and even enmity The feeling steadily grew until they found themselves looking up quickly or glancing back over their shoulders as if they expected a sudden blow There was not as yet any sign of a path and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way Pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer and without warning let out a shout Oi Oi he cried I am not going to do anything Just let me pass through will you The others halted startled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain There was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than before I should not shout if I were you said Merry It does more harm than good Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through and if he had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood Merry was looking from side to side and seemed already uncertain which way to go Pippin noticed it It has not taken you long to lose us he said But at that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead Well well he said These trees _do_ shift There is the Bonfire Glade in front of us or I hope so but the path to it seems to have moved away The light grew clearer as they went forward Suddenly they came out of the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space There was sky above them blue and clear to their surprise for down under the Forestroof they had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist The sun was not however high enough yet to shine down into the clearing though its light was on the treetops The leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade enclosing it with an almost solid wall No tree grew there only rough grass and many tall plants stalky and faded hemlocks and woodparsley fireweed seeding into fluffy ashes and rampant nettles and thistles A dreary place but it seemed a charming and cheerful garden after the close Forest The hobbits felt encouraged and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the sky At the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall of trees and a clear path beyond it They could see it running on into the wood wide in places and open above though every now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs Up this path they rode They were still climbing gently but they now went much quicker and with better heart for it seemed to them that the Forest had relented and was going to let them pass unhindered after all But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy The trees drew close again on either side and they could no longer see far ahead Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them So silent was it that the fall of their ponies hoofs rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots seemed to thud in their ears Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them but his voice sank to a murmur O Wanderers in the shadowed land despair not For though dark they stand all woods there be must end at last and see the open sun go past the setting sun the rising sun the days end or the day begun For east or west all woods must fail _Fail _ even as he said the word his voice faded into silence The air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome Just behind them a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path The trees seemed to close in before them They do not like all that about ending and failing said Merry I should not sing any more at present Wait till we do get to the edge and then well turn and give them a rousing chorus He spoke cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety he did not show it The others did not answer They were depressed A heavy weight was settling steadily on Frodos heart and he regretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees He was indeed just about to stop and propose going back if that was still possible when things took a new turn The path stopped climbing and became for a while nearly level The dark trees drew aside and ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward Before them but some distance off there stood a green hilltop treeless rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood The path seemed to be making directly for it They now hurried forward again delighted with the thought of climbing out for a while above the roof of the Forest The path dipped and then again began to climb upwards leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside There it left the trees and faded into the turf The wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown The hobbits led their ponies up winding round and round until they reached the top There they stood and gazed about them The air was gleaming and sunlit but hazy and they could not see to any great distance Near at hand the mist was now almost gone though here and there it lay in hollows of the wood and to the south of them out of a deep fold cutting right across the Forest the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke That said Merry pointing with his hand that is the line of the Withywindle It comes down out of the Downs and flows southwest through the midst of the Forest to join the Brandywine below Haysend We dont want to go _that_ way The Withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the whole wood the centre from which all the queerness comes as it were The others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out but they could see little but mists over the damp and deepcut valley and beyond it the southern half of the Forest faded from view The sun on the hilllop was now getting hot It must have been about eleven oclock but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions In the west they could not make out either the line of the Hedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyond it Northward where they looked most hopefully they could see nothing that might be the line of the great East Road for which they were making They were on an island in a sea of trees and the horizon was veiled On the southeastern side the ground fell very steeply as if the slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees like islandshores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them while they ate their midday meal As the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the east the greygreen lines of the Downs that lay beyond the Old Forest on that side That cheered them greatly for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond the woods borders though they did not mean to go that way if they could help it the Barrowdowns had as sinister a reputation in hobbitlegend as the Forest itself At length they made up their minds to go on again The path that had brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side but they had not followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right Soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must actually be heading towards the Withywindle valley not at all the direction they wished lo take After some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward for although they had not been able to see it from the hilltop the Road must lie that way and it could not be many miles off Also northward and to the left of the path the land seemed lo be drier and more open climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the denser wood At first their choice seemed to be good they got along at a fair speed though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards But after a time the trees began to close in again just where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and less tangled Then deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly like the ruts of great giantwheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and choked with brambles These lay usually right across their line of march and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies Each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted undergrowth which somehow would not yield to the left but only gave way when they turned to the right and they had to go some distance along the bottom before they could find a way up the further bank Each time they clambered out the trees seemed deeper and darker and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way and they were forced to the right and downwards After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction though they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all They were being headed off and were simply following a course chosen for them eastwards and southwards into the heart of the Forest and not out of it The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met It was so sleep and overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again either forwards or backwards without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind All they could do was to follow the fold downwards The ground grew soft and in places boggy springs appeared in the banks and soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed Then the ground began to fall rapidly and the brook growing strong and noisy flowed and leaped swiftly downhill They were in a deep dimlit gully overarched by trees high above them After stumbling along for some way along the stream they came quite suddenly out of the gloom As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them Coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank almost a cliff At its feet was a wide space of grass and reeds and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep A golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between In the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of brown water bordered with ancient willows arched over with willows blocked with fallen willows and flecked with thousands of faded willowleaves The air was thick with them fluttering yellow from the branches for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley and the reeds were rustling and the willowboughs were creaking Well now I have at least some notion of where we are said Merry We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended This is the River Withywindle I will go on and explore He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses After a while he reappeared and reported that there was fairly solid ground between the clifffoot and the river in some places firm turf went down to the waters edge Whats more he said there seems to be something like a footpath winding along on this side of the river If we turn left and follow it we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the Forest eventually I dare say said Pippin That is if the track goes on so far and does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there Who made the track do you suppose and why I am sure it was not for our benefit I am getting very suspicious of this Forest and everything in it and I begin to believe all the stories about it And have you any idea how far eastward we should have to go No said Merry I havent I dont know in the least how far down the Withywindle we are or who could possibly come here often enough to make a path along it But there is no other way out that I can see or think of There being nothing else for it they filed out and Merry led them to the path that he had discovered Everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall in places far above their heads but once found the path was easy to follow as it turned and twisted picking out the sounder ground among the bogs and pools Here and there it passed over other rills running down gullies into the Withywindle out of the higher forestlands and at these points there were treetrunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across The hobbits began to feel very hot There were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round their ears and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs At last they came suddenly into a thin shade great grey branches reached across the path Each step forward became more reluctant than the last Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod Just in front of him Pippin fell forward on to his knees Frodo halted Its no good he heard Merry saying Cant go another step without rest Must have nap Its cool under the willows Less flies Frodo did not like the sound of this Come on he cried We cant have a nap yet We must get clear of the Forest first But the others were too far gone to care Beside them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly Suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him His head swam There now seemed hardly a sound in the air The flies had stopped buzzing Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered seemed to stir in the boughs above He lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him a huge willowtree old and hoary Enormous it looked its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many longfingered hands its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved The leaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him and he toppled over lying where he fell upon the grass Merry and Pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their backs to the willowtrunk Behind them the great cracks gaped wide to receive them as the tree swayed and creaked They looked up at the grey and yellow leaves moving softly against the light and singing They shut their eyes and then it seemed that they could almost hear words cool words saying something about water and sleep They gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow Frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering him then with an effort he struggled to his feel again He felt a compelling desire for cool water Wait for me Sam he stammered Must bathe feet a minute Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree where great winding roots grew out into the stream like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink He straddled one of these and paddled his hot feel in the cool brown water and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against the tree Sam sat down and scratched his head and yawned like a cavern He was worried The afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny Theres more behind this than sun and warm air he muttered to himself I dont like this great big tree I dont trust it Hark at it singing about sleep now This wont do at all He pulled himself to his feet and staggered off to see what had become of the ponies He found that two had wandered on a good way along the path and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others when he heard two noises one loud and the other soft but very clear One was the splash of something heavy falling into the water the other was a noise like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast He rushed back to the bank Frodo was in the water close to the edge and a great treeroot seemed to be over him and holding him down but he was not struggling Sam gripped him by the jacket and dragged him from under the root and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank Almost at once he woke and coughed and spluttered Do you know Sam he said at length the beastly tree _threw_ me in I felt it The big root just twisted round and tipped me in You were dreaming I expect Mr Frodo said Sam You shouldnt sit in such a place if you feel sleepy What about the others Frodo asked I wonder what sort of dreams they are having They went round to the other side of the tree and then Sam understood the click that he had heard Pippin had vanished The crack by which he had laid himself had closed together so that not a chink could be seen Merry was trapped another crack had closed about his waist his legs lay outside but the rest of him was inside a dark opening the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincers Frodo and Sam beat first upon the treetrunk where Pippin had lain They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held poor Merry It was quite useless What a foul thing to happen cried Frodo wildly Why did we ever come into this dreadful Forest I wish we were all back at Crickhollow He kicked the tree with all his strength heedless of his own feet A hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches the leaves rustled and whispered but with a sound now of faint and faroff laughter I suppose we havent got an axe among our luggage Mr Frodo asked Sam I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood said Frodo That wouldnt be much use Wait a minute cried Sam struck by an idea suggested by firewood We might do something with fire We might said Frodo doubtfully We might succeed in roasting Pippin alive inside We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with said Sam fiercely If it dont let them go Ill have it down if I have to gnaw it He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinderboxes and a hatchet Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves and bits of bark and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks These they heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners As soon as Sam had struck a spark into the tinder it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of flame and smoke went up The twigs crackled Little fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it A tremor ran through the whole willow The leaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a sound of pain and anger A loud scream came from Merry and from far inside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell Put it out Put it out cried Merry Hell squeeze me in two if you dont He says so Who What shouted Frodo rushing round to the other side of the tree Put it out Put it out begged Merry The branches of the willow began to sway violently There was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about as though they had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the rivervalley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the whole Forest Sam kicked at the little fire and stamped out the sparks But Frodo without any clear idea of why he did so or what he hoped for ran along the path crying _help help help_It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice it was blown away from him by the willowwind and drowned in a clamour of leaves as soon as the words left his mouth He felt desperate lost and witless Suddenly he slopped There was an answer or so he thought but it seemed to come from behind him away down the path further back in the Forest He turned round and listened and soon there could be no doubt someone was singing a song a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and happily but it was singing nonsense Hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo Ring a dong hop along fal lal the willow Tom Bom jolly Tom Tom Bombadillo Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger Frodo and Sam now both stood still Suddenly out of a long string of nonsensewords or so they seemed the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song Hey Come merry dot derry dol My darling Light goes the weatherwind and the feathered starling Down along under Hill shining in the sunlight Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight There my pretty lady is Riverwomans daughter Slender as the willowwand clearer than the water Old Tom Bombadil waterlilies bringing Comes hopping home again Can you hear him singing Hey Come merry dol deny dol and merryo Goldberry Goldberry merry yellow berryo Poor old Willowman you tuck your roots away Toms in a hurry now Evening will follow day Toms going home again waterlilies bringing Hey Come derry dol Can you hear me singing Frodo and Sam stood as if enchanted The wind puffed out The leaves hung silently again on stiff branches There was another burst of song and then suddenly hopping and dancing along the path there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band With another hop and a bound there came into view a man or so it seemed At any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit if not quite tall enough for one of the Big People though he made noise enough for one slumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink He had a blue coat and a long brown beard his eyes were blue and bright and his face was red as a ripe apple but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter In his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white waterlilies Help cried Frodo and Sam running towards him with their hands stretched out Whoa Whoa steady there cried the old man holding up one hand and they stopped short as if they had been struck stiff Now my little fellows where be you agoing to puffing like a bellows Whats the matter here then Do you know who I am Im Tom Bombadil Tell me whats your trouble Toms in a hurry now Dont you crush my lilies My friends are caught in the willowtree cried Frodo breathlessly Master Merrys being squeezed in a crack cried Sam What shouted Tom Bombadil leaping up in the air Old Man Willow Naught worse than that eh That can soon be mended I know the tune for him Old grey Willowman Ill freeze his marrow cold if he dont behave himself Ill sing his roots off Ill sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away Old Man Willow Setting down his lilies carefully on the grass he ran to the tree There he saw Merrys feet still sticking out the rest had already been drawn further inside Tom put his mouth to the crack and began singing into it in a low voice They could not catch the words but evidently Merry was aroused His legs began to kick Tom sprang away and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with it You let them out again Old Man Willow he said What be you athinking of You should not be waking Eat earth Dig deep Drink water Go to sleep Bombadil is talking He then seized Merrys feet and drew him out of the suddenly widening crack There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open and out of it Pippin sprang as if he had been kicked Then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again A shudder ran through the tree from root to tip and complete silence fell Thank you said the hobbits one after the other Tom Bombadil burst out laughing Well my little fellows said he stooping so that he peered into their faces You shall come home with me The table is all laden with yellow cream honeycomb and white bread and butter Goldberry is waiting Time enough for questions around the supper table You follow after me as quick as you are able With that he picked up his lilies and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward still singing loudly and nonsensically Too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbits followed after him as fast as they could But that was not fast enough Tom soon disappeared in front of them and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away Suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo Hop along my little friends up the Withywindle Toms going on ahead candles for to kindle Down west sinks the Sun soon you will be groping When the nightshadows fall then the door will open Out of the windowpanes light will twinkle yellow Fear no alder black Heed no hoary willow Fear neither root nor bough Tom goes on before you Hey now merry dot Well be waiting for you After that the hobbits heard no more Almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behind them They thought of the slanting light of evening glittering on the Brandywine River and the windows of Bucklebury beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights Great shadows fell across them trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path White mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders Out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk It became difficult to follow the path and they were very tired Their legs seemed leaden Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on either side of them and if they looked up to the pale sky they caught sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the wood They began to feel that all this country was unreal and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill they noticed that the ground was gently rising The water began to murmur In the darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam where the river flowed over a short fall Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left behind They stepped out from the Forest and found a wide sweep of grass welling up before them The river now small and swift was leaping merrily down to meet them glinting here and there in the light of the stars which were already shining in the sky The grass under their feet was smooth and short as if it had been mown or shaven The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped and trim as a hedge The path was now plain before them welltended and bordered with stone It wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll now grey under the pale starry night and there still high above them on a further slope they saw the twinkling lights of a house Down again the path went and then up again up a long smooth hillside of turf towards the light Suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened There was Tom Bombadils house before them up down under hill Behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey and bare and beyond that the dark shapes of the Barrowdowns stalked away into the eastern night They all hurried forward hobbits and ponies Already half their weariness and all their fears had fallen from them _Hey Come merry dol_ rolled out the song to greet them Hey Come derry dol Hop along my hearties Hobbits Ponies all We are fond of parties Now let the fun begin Let us sing together Then another clear voice as young and as ancient as Spring like the song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in the hills came falling like silver to meet them Now let the song begin Let us sing together Of sun stars moon and mist rain and cloudy weather Light on the budding leaf dew on the feather Wind on the open hill bells on the heather Reeds by the shady pool lilies on the water Old Tom Bombadil and the Riverdaughter And with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold and a golden light was all about them _Chapter 7_ In the House of Tom Bombadil The four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold and stood still blinking They were in a long low room filled with the light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof and on the table of dark polished wood stood many candles tall and yellow burning brightly In a chair at the far side of the room facing the outer door sat a woman Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders her gown was green green as young reeds shot with silver like beads of dew and her belt was of gold shaped like a chain of flaglilies set with the paleblue eyes of forgetmenots About her feel in wide vessels of green and brown earthenware white waterlilies were floating so that she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool Enter good guests she said and as she spoke they knew that it was her clear voice they had heard singing They came a few timid steps further into the room and began to bow low feeling strangely surprised and awkward like folk that knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of water have been answered by a fair young elfqueen clad in living flowers But before they could say anything she sprang lightly up and over the lilybowls and ran laughing towards them and as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river Come dear folk she said taking Frodo by the hand Laugh and be merry I am Goldberry daughter of the River Then lightly she passed them and closing the door she turned her back to it with her white arms spread out across it Let us shut out the night she said For you are still afraid perhaps of mist and treeshadows and deep water and untame things Fear nothing For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil The hobbits looked at her in wonder and she looked at each of them and smiled Fair lady Goldberry said Frodo at last feeling his heart moved with a joy that he did not understand He stood as he had at times stood enchanted by fair elvenvoices but the spell that was now laid upon him was different less keen and lofty was the delight but deeper and nearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet not strange Fair lady Goldberry he said again Now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to me O slender as a willowwand O clearer than clear water O reed by the living pool Fair Riverdaughter O springtime and summertime and spring again after O wind on the waterfall and the leaves laughter Suddenly he stopped and stammered overcome with surprise to hear himself saying such things But Goldberry laughed Welcome she said I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so sweettongued But I see you are an elffriend the light in your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it This is a merry meeting Sit now and wait for the Master of the house He will not be long He is tending your tired beasts The hobbits sat down gladly in low rushseated chairs while Goldberry busied herself about the table and their eyes followed her for the slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight From somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing Every now and again they caught among many a _derry dol_ and a _merry dol_ and a _ring a ding dillo_ the repeated words Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow Bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow Fair lady said Frodo again after a while Tell me if my asking does not seem foolish who is Tom Bombadil He is said Goldberry staying her swift movements and smiling Frodo looked at her questioningly He is as you have seen him she said in answer to his look He is the Master of wood water and hill Then all this strange land belongs to him No indeed she answered and her smile faded That would indeed be a burden she added in a low voice as if to herself The trees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to themselves Tom Bombadil is the Master No one has ever caught old Tom walking in the forest wading in the water leaping on the hilltops under light and shadow He has no fear Tom Bombadil is master A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil He had now no hat and his thick brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves He laughed and going to Goldberry took her hand Heres my pretty lady he said bowing to the hobbits Heres my Goldberry clothed all in silvergreen with flowers in her girdle Is the table laden I see yellow cream and honeycomb and white bread and butter milk cheese and green herbs and ripe berries gathered Is that enough for us Is the supper ready It is said Goldberry but the guests perhaps are not Tom clapped his hands and cried Tom Tom your guests are tired and you had near forgotten Come now my merry friends and Tom will refresh you You shall clean grimy hands and wash your weary faces cast off your muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles He opened the door and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn They came to a low room with a sloping roof a penthouse it seemed built on to the north end of the house Its walls were of clean stone but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats and yellow curtains The floor was flagged and strewn with fresh green rushes There were four deep mattresses each piled with white blankets laid on the floor along one side Against the opposite wall was a long bench laden with wide earthenware basins and beside it stood brown ewers filled with water some cold some steaming hot There were soft green slippers set ready beside each bed Before long washed and refreshed the hobbits were seated at the table two on each side while at either end sat Goldberry and the Master It was a long and merry meal Though the hobbits ate as only famished hobbits can eat there was no lack The drink in their drinkingbowls seemed to be clear cold water yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices The guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily as if it was easier and more natural than talking At last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly The guests were commanded to sit quiet and were set in chairs each with a footstool to his tired feet There was a fire in the wide hearth before them and it was burning with a sweet smell as if it were built of applewood When everything was set in order all the lights in the room were put out except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the chimneyshelf Then Goldberry came and stood before them holding a candle and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep Have peace now she said until the morning Heed no nightly noises For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hilltop Good night She passed out of the room with a glimmer and a rustle The sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night Tom sat on a while beside them in silence while each of them tried to muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper Sleep gathered on their eyelids At last Frodo spoke Did you hear me calling Master or was it just chance that brought you at that moment Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream Eh what said he Did I hear you calling Nay I did not hear I was busy singing Just chance brought me then if chance you call it It was no plan of mine though I was waiting for you We heard news of you and learned that you were wandering We guessed youd come ere long down to the water all paths lead that way down to Withywindle Old grey Willowman hes a mighty singer and its hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazes But Tom had an errand there that he dared not hinder Tom nodded as if sleep was taking him again but he went on in a soft singing voice I had an errand there gathering waterlilies green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady the last ere the years end to keep them from the winter to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted Each year at summers end I go to find them for her in a wide pool deep and clear far down Withywindle there they open first in spring and there they linger latest By that pool long ago I found the Riverdaughter fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes Sweet was her singing then and her heart was beating He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue And that proved well for you for now I shall no longer go down deep again along the forestwater not while the year is old Nor shall I be passing Old Man Willows house this side of springtime not till the merry spring when the Riverdaughter dances down the withypath to bathe in the water He fell silent again but Frodo could not help asking one more question the one he most desired to have answered Tell us Master he said about the Willowman What is he I have never heard of him before No dont said Merry and Pippin together sitting suddenly upright Not now Not until the morning That is right said the old man Now is the time for resting Some things are ill to hear when the worlds in shadow Sleep till the morninglight rest on the pillow Heed no nightly noise Fear no grey willow And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out and grasping a candle in either hand he led them out of the room Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down and the blankets were of white wool They had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep In the dead night Frodo lay in a dream without light Then he saw the young moon rising under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall of rock pierced by a dark arch like a great gate It seemed to Frodo that he was lifted up and passing over he saw that the rockwall was a circle of hills and that within it was a plain and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone like a vast tower but not made by hands On its top stood the figure of a man The moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it Up from the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices and the howling of many wolves Suddenly a shadow like the shape of great wings passed across the moon The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he wielded A mighty eagle swept down and bore him away The voices wailed and the wolves yammered There was a noise like a strong wind blowing and on it was borne the sound of hoofs galloping galloping galloping from the East Black Riders thought Frodo as he wakened with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in his mind He wondered if he would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone walls He lay motionless still listening but all was now silent and at last he turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some other unremembered dream At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly but a change came over his dreams and he turned and groaned Suddenly he woke or thought he had waked and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream _tiptap squeak_ the noise was like branches fretting in the wind twigfingers scraping wall and window _creak creak creak_ He wondered if there were willowtrees close to the house and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all but inside the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again He sat up and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands and he lay down again relieved He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears Fear nothing Have peace until the morning Heed no nightly noises Then he went to sleep again It was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet sleep water streaming down gently and then spreading spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool It gurgled under the walls and was rising slowly but surely I shall be drowned he thought It will find its way in and then I shall drown He felt that he was lying in a soft slimy bog and springing up he set his fool on the corner of a cold hard flagstone Then he remembered where he was and lay down again He seemed to hear or remember hearing Nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hilltop A little breath of sweet air moved the curtain He breathed deep and fell asleep again As far as he could remember Sam slept through the night in deep content if logs are contented They woke up all four at once in the morning light Tom was moving about the room whistling like a starling When he heard them stir he clapped his hands and cried Hey Come merry dol derry dol My hearties He drew back the yellow curtains and the hobbits saw that these had covered the windows at either end of the room one looking east and the other looking west They leapt up refreshed Frodo ran to the eastern window and found himself looking into a kitchengarden grey with dew He had half expected to see turf right up to the walls turf all pocked with hoofprints Actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles but above and far beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise It was a pale morning in the East behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges lay glimmering deeps of yellow The sky spoke of rain to come but the light was broadening quickly and the red flowers on the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves Pippin looked out of the western window down into a pool of mist The Forest was hidden under a fog It was like looking down on to a sloping cloudroof from above There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and billows the valley of the Withywindle The stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows Near at hand was a flowergarden and a clipped hedge silvernetted and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dewdrops There was no willowtree to be seen Good morning merry friends cried Tom opening the eastern window wide A cool air flowed in it had a rainy smell Sun wont show her face much today Im thinking I have been walking wide leaping on the hilltops since the grey dawn began nosing wind and weather wet grass underfoot wet sky above me I wakened Goldberry singing under window but nought wakes hobbitfolk in the early morning In the night little folk wake up in the darkness and sleep after light has come Ring a ding dillo Wake now my merry friends Forget the nightly noises Ring a ding dillo del derry del my hearties If you come soon youll find breakfast on the table If you come late youll get grass and rainwater Needless to say not that Toms threat sounded very serious the hobbits came soon and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo look rather empty Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there Tom could be heard about the house clattering in the kitchen and up and down the stairs and singing here and there outside The room looked westward over the mistclouded valley and the window was open Water dripped down from the thatched eaves above Before they had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down Behind its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled As they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was flowing down the rain out of the sky the clear voice of Goldberry singing up above them They could hear few words but it seemed plain to them that the song was a rainsong as sweet as showers on dry hills that told the tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below The hobbits listened with delight and Frodo was glad in his heart and blessed the kindly weather because it delayed them from departing The thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke but he guessed now that they would not go further that day The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds rolled up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the Downs Nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water Frodo stood near the open door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and go bubbling away down into the valley Tom Bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain and indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry except for his boots These he took off and put in the chimneycorner Then he sat in the largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him This is Goldberrys washing day he said and her autumncleaning Too wet for hobbitfolk let them rest while they are able Its a good day for long tales for questions and for answers so Tom will start the talking He then told them many remarkable stories sometimes half as if speaking to himself sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue eye under his deep brows Often his voice would turn to song and he would get out of his chair and dance about He told them tales of bees and flowers the ways of trees and the strange creatures of the Forest about the evil things and good things things friendly and things unfriendly cruel things and kind things and secrets hidden under brambles As they listened they began to understand the lives of the Forest apart from themselves indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all other things were at home Moving constantly in and out of his talk was Old Man Willow and Frodo learned now enough to content him indeed more than enough for it was not comfortable lore Toms words laid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts which were often dark and strange and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon the earth gnawing biting breaking hacking burning destroyers and usurpers It was not called the Old Forest without reason for it was indeed ancient a survivor of vast forgotten woods and in it there lived yet ageing no quicker than the hills the fathers of the fathers of trees remembering times when they were lords The countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom and with malice But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow his heart was rotten but his strength was green and he was cunning and a master of winds and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine rootthreads in the ground and invisible twigfingers in the air till it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs Suddenly Toms talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream over bubbling waterfalls over pebbles and worn rocks and among small flowers in close grass and wet crannies wandering at last up on to the Downs They heard of the Great Barrows and the green mounds and the stonerings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills Sheep were bleating in flocks Green walls and white walls rose There were fortresses on the heights Kings of little kingdoms fought together and the young Sun shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords There was victory and defeat and towers fell fortresses were burned and flames went up into the sky Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens and mounds covered them and the stone doors were shut and the grass grew over all Sheep walked for a while biting the grass but soon the hills were empty again A shadow came out of dark places far away and the bones were stirred in the mounds Barrowwights walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers and gold chains in the wind Stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight The hobbits shuddered Even in the Shire the rumour of the Barrowwights of the Barrowdowns beyond the Forest had been heard But it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to even by a comfortable fireside far away These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this house had driven from their minds the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills They lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily looking aside at one another When they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought into limes when the world was wider and the seas flowed straight to the western Shore and still on and back Tom went singing out into ancient starlight when only the Elfsires were awake Then suddenly he slopped and they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep The hobbits sat still before him enchanted and it seemed as if under the spell of his words the wind had gone and the clouds had dried up and the day had been withdrawn and darkness had come from East and West and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed Frodo could not tell He did not feel either hungry or tired only filled with wonder The stars shone through the window and the silence of the heavens seemed to be round him He spoke at last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence Who are you Master he asked Eh what said Tom sitting up and his eyes glinting in the gloom Dont you know my name yet Thats the only answer Tell me who are you alone yourself and nameless But you are young and I am old Eldest thats what I am Mark my words my friends Tom was here before the river and the trees Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn He made paths before the Big People and saw the little People arriving He was here before the Kings and the graves and the Barrowwights When the Elves passed westward Tom was here already before the seas were bent He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless before the Dark Lord came from Outside A shadow seemed to pass by the window and the hobbits glanced hastily through the panes When they turned again Goldberry stood in the door behind framed in light She held a candle shielding its flame from the draught with her hand and the light flowed through it like sunlight through a white shell The rain has ended she said and new waters are running downhill under the stars Let us now laugh and be glad And let us have food and drink cried Tom Long tales are thirsty And long listenings hungry work morning noon and evening With that he jumped out of his chair and with a bound took a candle from the chimneyshelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held then he danced about the table Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared Quickly he returned bearing a large and laden tray Then Tom and Goldberry set the table and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in laughter so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings of Tom Yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance neither hindering the other in and out of the room and round about the table and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order The boards blazed with candles white and yellow Tom bowed to his guests Supper is ready said Goldberry and now the hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with a white girdle and her shoes were like fishes mail But Tom was all in clean blue blue as rainwashed forgetmenots and he had green stockings It was a supper even better than before The hobbits under the spell of Toms words may have missed one meal or many but when the food was before them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten They did not sing or even speak much for a while and paid close attention to business But after a time their hearts and spirit rose high again and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter After they had eaten Goldberry sang many songs for them songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence and in the silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had known and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depths Then once more she wished them each good night and left them by the fireside But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions He appeared already to know much about them and all their families and indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the Shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves It no longer surprised them but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to Farmer Maggot whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance than they had imagined Theres earth under his old feet and clay on his fingers wisdom in his bones and both his eyes are open said Tom It was also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves and it seemed that in some fashion news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo Indeed so much did Tom know and so cunning was his questioning that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before even to Gandalf Tom wagged his head up and down and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders Show me the precious Ring he said suddenly in the midst of the story and Frodo to his own astonishment drew out the chain from his pocket and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brownskinned hand Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed For a second the hobbits had a vision both comical and alarming of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold Then Tom put the Ring round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight For a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this Then they gasped There was no sign of Tom disappearing Tom laughed again and then he spun the Ring in the air and it vanished with a flash Frodo gave a cry and Tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile Frodo looked at it closely and rather suspiciously like one who has lent a trinket to a juggler It was the same Ring or looked the same and weighed the same for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand But something prompted him to make sure He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important He waited for an opportunity when the talk was going again and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers and their queer ways then he slipped the Ring on Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start and checked an exclamation Frodo was delighted in a way it was his own ring all right for Merry was staring blankly at his chair and obviously could not see him He got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door Hey there cried Tom glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his shining eyes Hey Come Frodo there Where be you agoing Old Tom Bombadils not as blind as that yet Take off your golden ring Your hands more fair without it Come back Leave your game and sit down beside me We must talk a while more and think about the morning Tom must teach the right road and keep your feet from wandering Frodo laughed trying to feel pleased and taking off the Ring he came and sat down again Tom now told them that he reckoned the Sun would shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning and setting out would be hopeful But they would do well to start early for weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long and it would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket I am no weathermaster he said nor is aught that goes on two legs By his advice they decided to make nearly due North from his house over the western and lower slopes of the Downs they might hope in that way to strike the East Road in a days journey and avoid the Barrows He told them not to be afraid but to mind their own business Keep to the green grass Dont you go ameddling with old stone or cold Wights or prying in their houses unless you be strong folk with hearts that never falter He said this more than once and he advised them to pass barrows by on the westside if they chanced to stray near one Then he taught them a rhyme to sing if they should by illluck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day Ho Tom Bombadil Tom Bombadillo By water wood and hill by the reed and willow By fire sun and moon harken now and hear us Come Tom Bombadil for our need is near us When they had sung this altogether after him he clapped them each on the shoulder with a laugh and taking candles led them back to their bedroom _Chapter 8_ Fog on the BarrowDowns That night they heard no noises But either in his dreams or out of them he could not tell which Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey raincurtain and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver until at last it was rolled back and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise The vision melted into waking and there was Tom whistling like a treefull of birds and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open window Outside everything was green and pale gold After breakfast which they again ate alone they made ready to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning cool bright and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue The air came fresh from the Northwest Their quiet ponies were almost frisky sniffing and moving restlessly Tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed They rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house and went slanting up towards the north end of the hillbrow under which it sheltered They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep slope when suddenly Frodo stopped Goldberry he cried My fair lady clad all in silver green We have never said farewell to her nor seen her since the evening He was so distressed that he turned back but at that moment a clear call came rippling down There on the hillbrow she stood beckoning to them her hair was flying loose and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered A light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she danced They hastened up the last slope and stood breathless beside her They bowed but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round and they looked out from the hilltop over lands under the morning It was now as clear and farseen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in the Forest which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark trees in the West In that direction the land rose in wooded ridges green yellow russet under the sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the Brandywine To the South over the line of the Withywindle there was a distant glint like pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits Northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and swellings of grey and green and pale earthcolours until it faded into a featureless and shadowy distance Eastward the Barrowdowns rose ridge behind ridge into the morning and vanished out of eyesight into a guess it was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky but it spoke to them out of memory and old tales of the high and distant mountains They took a deep draught of the air and felt that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wherever they wished It seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road when they should be leaping as lusty as Tom over the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the Mountains Goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts Speed now fair guests she said And hold to your purpose North with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps Make haste while the Sun shines And to Frodo she said Farewell Elffriend it was a merry meeting But Frodo found no words to answer He bowed low and mounted his pony and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill Tom Bombadils house and the valley and the Forest were lost to view The air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed Turning back when they reached the bottom of the green hollow they saw Goldberry now small and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky she was standing still watching them and her hands were stretched out towards them As they looked she gave a clear call and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill Their way wound along the floor of the hollow and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley and then over the shoulder of further hills and down their long limbs and up their smooth sides again up on to new hilltops and down into new valleys There was no tree nor any visible water it was a country of grass and short springy turf silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land and high lonely cries of strange birds As they journeyed the sun mounted and grew hot Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less When they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forest seemed to be smoking as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf and root and mould A shadow now lay round the edge of sight a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap hot and heavy About midday they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim Inside there was no air stirring and the sky seemed near their heads They rode across and looked northwards Then their hearts rose for it seemed plain that they had come further already than they had expected Certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptive but there could be no doubt that the Downs were coming to an end A long valley lay below them winding away northwards until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders Beyond there seemed to be no more hills Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line That is a line of trees said Merry and that must mark the Road All along it for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing Some say they were planted in the old days Splendid said Frodo If we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning we shall have left the Downs before the Sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place But even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and looked down upon them and all those hills were crowned with green mounds and on some were standing stones pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums That view was somehow disquieting so they turned from the sight and went down into the hollow circle In the midst of it there stood a single stone standing tall under the sun above and at this hour casting no shadow It was shapeless and yet significant like a landmark or a guarding finger or more like a warning But they were now hungry and the sun was still at the fearless noon so they set their backs against the east side of the stone It was cool as if the sun had had no power to warm it but at that time this seemed pleasant There they took food and drink and made as good a noonmeal under the open sky as anyone could wish for the food came from down under Hill Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass Riding over the hills and eating their fill the warm sun and the scent of turf lying a little too long stretching out their legs and looking at the sky above their noses these things are perhaps enough to explain what happened However that may be they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take The standing stone was cold and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them The sun a pale and watery yellow was gleaming through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay north south and east beyond the wall the fog was thick cold and white The air was silent heavy and chill Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm and ran to the western rim They found that they were upon an island in the fog Even as they looked out in dismay towards the setting sun it sank before their eyes into a white sea and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind The fog rolled up to the walls and rose above them and as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone They felt as if a trap was closing about them but they did not quite lose heart They still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the Road ahead and they still knew in which direction it lay In any case they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there was in their minds They packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and down the long northward slope of the hill down into a foggy sea As they went down the mist became colder and damper and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads When they reached the bottom it was so cold that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods which soon became bedewed with grey drops Then mounting their ponies they went slowly on again feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground They were steering as well as they could guess for the gatelike opening at the far northward end of the long valley which they had seen in the morning Once they were through the gap they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line and they were bound in the end to strike the Road Their thoughts did not go beyond that except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the Downs there might be no fog Their going was very slow To prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions they went in file with Frodo leading Sam was behind him and after him came Pippin and then Merry The valley seemed to stretch on endlessly Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign On either side ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist and he guessed that they were at last approaching the gap in the hills the northgate of the Barrowdowns If they could pass that they would be free Come on Follow me he called back over his shoulder and he hurried forward But his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm The dark patches grew darker but they shrank and suddenly he saw towering ominous before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a headless door two huge standing stones He could not remember having seen any sign of these in the valley when he looked out from the hill in the morning He had passed between them almost before he was aware and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him His pony reared and snorted and he fell off When he looked back he found that he was alone the others had not followed him Sam he called Pippin Merry Come along Why dont you keep up There was no answer Fear took him and he ran back past the stones shouting wildly Sam Sam Merry Pippin The pony bolted into the mist and vanished From some way off or so it seemed he thought he heard a cry Hoy Frodo Hoy It was away eastward on his left as he stood under the great stones staring and straining into the gloom He plunged off in the direction of the call and found himself going steeply uphill As he struggled on he called again and kept on calling more and more frantically but he heard no answer for some time and then it seemed faint and far ahead and high above him Frodo Hoy came the thin voices out of the mist and then a cry that sounded like _help help_ often repeated ending with a last _help_ that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut short He stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries but the light was now gone and clinging night had closed about him so that it was impossible to be sure of any direction He seemed all the time to be climbing up and up Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he at last came to the top of a ridge or hill He was weary sweating and yet chilled It was wholly dark Where are you he cried out miserably There was no reply He stood listening He was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold and that up here a wind was beginning to blow an icy wind A change was coming in the weather The mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters His breath was smoking and the darkness was less near and thick He looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog The wind began to hiss over the grass He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and he made towards it and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside and the starry sky was unveiled A glance showed him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round hilltop which he must have climbed from the north Out of the east the biting wind was blowing To his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape A great barrow stood there Where are you he cried again both angry and afraid Here said a voice deep and cold that seemed to come out of the ground I am waiting for you No said Frodo but he did not run away His knees gave and he fell on the ground Nothing happened and there was no sound Trembling he looked up in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars It leaned over him He thought there were two eyes very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance Then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized him The icy touch froze his bones and he remembered no more When he came to himself again for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense of dread Then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned caught hopelessly he was in a barrow A Barrowwight had taken him and he was probably already under the dreadful spells of the Barrowwights about which whispered tales spoke He dared not move but lay as he found himself flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkness that was round him he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo Baggins and his stories of their jogging along together in the lanes of the Shire and talking about roads and adventures There is a seed of courage hidden often deeply it is true in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid indeed though he did not know it Bilbo and Gandalf had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire He thought he had come to the end of his adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardened him He found himself stiffening as if for a final spring he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey As he lay there thinking and getting a hold of himself he noticed all at once that the darkness was slowly giving way a pale greenish light was growing round him It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in for the light seemed to be coming out of himself and from the floor beside him and had not yet reached the roof or wall He turned and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam Pippin and Merry They were on their backs and their faces looked deathly pale and they were clad in white About them lay many treasures of gold maybe though in that light they looked cold and unlovely On their heads were circlets gold chains were about their waists and on their fingers were many rings Swords lay by their sides and shields were at their feet But across their three necks lay one long naked sword Suddenly a song began a cold murmur rising and falling The voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary sometimes high in the air and thin sometimes like a low moan from the ground Out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds strings of words would now and again shape themselves grim hard cold words heartless and miserable The night was railing against the morning of which it was bereaved and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungered Frodo was chilled to the marrow After a while the song became clearer and with dread in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an incantation Cold be hand and heart and bone and cold be sleep under stone never mare to wake on stony bed never till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead In the black wind the stars shall die and still on gold here let them lie till the dark lord lifts his hand over dead sea and withered land He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound Raising himself on one arm he looked and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a corner Round the corner a long arm was groping walking on its fingers towards Sam who was lying nearest and towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the incantation Then a wild thought of escape came to him He wondered if he put on the Ring whether the Barrowwight would miss him and he might find some way out He thought of himself running free over the grass grieving for Merry and Sam and Pippin but free and alive himself Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong he could not leave his friends so easily He wavered groping in his pocket and then fought with himself again and as he did so the arm crept nearer Suddenly resolve hardened in him and he seized a short sword that lay beside him and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions With what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist and the hand broke off but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt There was a shriek and the light vanished In the dark there was a snarling noise Frodo fell forward over Merry and Merrys face felt cold All at once back into his mind from which it had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came the memory of the house down under the Hill and of Tom singing He remembered the rhyme that Tom had taught them In a small desperate voice he began _Ho Tom Bombadil_ and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong it had a full and lively sound and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet Ho Tom Bombadil Tom Bombadillo By water wood and hill by the reed and willow By fire sun and moon harken now and hear us Come Tom Bombadil for our need is near us There was a sudden deep silence in which Frodo could hear his heart beating After a long slow moment he heard plain but far away as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick walls an answering voice singing Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow Bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow None has ever caught him yet for Tom he is the master His songs are stronger songs and his feet are faster There was a loud rumbling sound as of stones rolling and falling and suddenly light streamed in real light the plain light of day A low doorlike opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond Frodos feet and there was Toms head hat feather and all framed against the light of the sun rising red behind him The light fell upon the floor and upon the faces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo They did not stir but the sickly hue had left them They looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep Tom stooped removed his hat and came into the dark chamber singing Get out you old Wight Vanish in the sunlight Shrivel like the cold mist like the winds go wailing Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains Come never here again Leave your barrow empty Lost and forgotten be darker than the darkness Where gates stand for ever shut till the world is mended At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash Then there was a long trailing shriek fading away into an unguessable distance and after that silence Come friend Frodo said Tom Let us get out on to clean grass You must help me bear them Together they carried out Merry Pippin and Sam As Frodo left the barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still like a wounded spider in a heap of fallen earth Tom went back in again and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping When he came out he was bearing in his arms a great load of treasure things of gold silver copper and bronze many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments He climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine There he stood with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair and looked down upon the three hobbits that had been laid on their backs upon the grass at the west side of the mound Raising his right hand he said in a clear and commanding voice Wake now my merry tads Wake and hear me calling Warm now be heart and limb The cold stone is fallen Dark door is standing wide dead hand is broken Night under Night is flown and the Gate is open To Frodos great joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms rubbed their eyes and then suddenly sprang up They looked about in amazement first at Frodo and then at Tom standing large as life on the barrowtop above them and then at themselves in their thin white rags crowned and belted with pale gold and jingling with trinkets What in the name of wonder began Merry feeling the golden circlet that had slipped over one eye Then he stopped and a shadow came over his face and he closed his eyes Of course I remember he said The men of Carn Dm came on us at night and we were worsted Ah the spear in my heart He clutched at his breast No No he said opening his eyes What am I saying I have been dreaming Where did you get to Frodo I thought that I was lost said Frodo but I dont want to speak of it Let us think of what we are to do now Let us go on Dressed up like this sir said Sam Where are my clothes He flung his circlet belt and rings on the grass and looked round helplessly as if he expected to find his cloak jacket and breeches and other hobbitgarments lying somewhere to hand You wont find your clothes again said Tom bounding down from the mound and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight One would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him and saw the merry glint in his eyes What do you mean asked Pippin looking at him half puzzled and half amused Why not But Tom shook his head saying Youve found yourselves again out of the deep water Clothes are but little loss if you escape from drowning Be glad my merry friends and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb Cast off these cold rags Run naked on the grass while Tom goes ahunting He sprang away down hill whistling and calling Looking down after him Frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between their hill and the next still whistling and crying Hey now Come hoy now Whither do you wander Up down near or far here there or yonder Sharpears Wisenose Swishtail and Bumpkin Whitesocks my little lad and old Fatty Lumpkin So he sang running fast tossing up his hat and catching it until he was hidden by a fold of the ground but for some time his _hey now hoy now_came floating back down the wind which had shifted round towards the south The air was growing very warm again The hobbits ran about for a while on the grass as he told them Then they lay basking in the sun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a friendly clime or of people that after being long ill and bedridden wake one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong and hungry He reappeared hat first over the brow of the hill and behind him came in an obedient line _six_ ponies their own five and one more The last was plainly old Fatty Lumpkin he was larger stronger fatter and older than their own ponies Merry to whom the others belonged had not in fact given them any such names but they answered to the new names that Tom had given them for the rest of their lives Tom called them one by one and they climbed over the brow and stood in a line Then Tom bowed to the hobbits Here are your ponies now he said Theyve more sense in some ways than you wandering hobbits have more sense in their noses For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into and if they run to save themselves then they run the right way You must forgive them all for though their hearts are faithful to face fear of Barrowwights is not what they were made for See here they come again bringing all their burdens Merry Sam and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs and they soon felt too hot for they were obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winter Where does that other old animal that Fatty Lumpkin come from asked Frodo Hes mine said Tom My fourlegged friend though I seldom ride him and he wanders often far free upon the hillsides When your ponies stayed with me they got to know my Lumpkin and they smelt him in the night and quickly ran to meet him I thought hed look for them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear away But now my jolly Lumpkin old Toms going to ride Hey hes coming with you just to set you on the road so he needs a pony For you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding when youre on your own legs trying to trot beside them The hobbits were delighted to hear this and thanked Tom many times but he laughed and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land Ive got things to do he said my making and my singing my talking and my walking and my watching of the country Tom cant be always near to open doors and willowcracks Tom has his house to mind and Goldberry is waiting It was still fairly early by the sun something between nine and ten and the hobbits turned their minds to food Their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before They breakfasted now off the remainder of Toms provisions meant for their supper with additions that Tom had brought with him It was not a large meal considering hobbits and the circumstances but they felt much better for it While they were eating Tom went up to the mound and looked through the treasures Most of these he made into a pile that glistened and sparkled on the grass He bade them lie there free to all finders birds beasts Elves or Men and all kindly creatures for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and no Wight ever come back to it He chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones manyshaded like flaxflowers or the wings of blue butterflies He looked long at it as if stirred by some memory shaking his head and saying at last Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady Fair was she who long ago wore this on her shoulder Goldberry shall wear it now and we will not forget her For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger long leafshaped and keen of marvellous workmanship damasked with serpentforms in red and gold They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths wrought of some strange metal light and strong and set with many fiery stones Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound the blades seemed untouched by time unrusted sharp glittering in the sun Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbitpeople he said Sharp blades are good to have if Shirefolk go walking east south or far away into dark and danger Then he told them that these blades were forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse they were foes of the Dark Lord but they were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dm in the Land of Angmar Few now remember them Tom murmured yet still some go wandering sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness guarding from evil things folk that are heedless The hobbits did not understand his words but as he spoke they had a vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men tall and grim with bright swords and last came one with a star on his brow Then the vision faded and they were back in the sunlit world It was time to start again They made ready packing their bags and lading their ponies Their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets feeling them very awkward and wondering if they would be of any use Fighting had not before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land them At last they set off They led their ponies down the hill and then mounting they trotted quickly along the valley They looked back and saw the top of the old mound on the hill and from it the sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flame Then they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it was hidden from view Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great stones standing like a gate and before long they came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through and the land fell away before them It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them or before them on Fatty Lumpkin who could move much faster than his girth promised Tom sang most of the time but it was chiefly nonsense or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight They went forward steadily but they soon saw that the Road was further away than they had imagined Even without a fog their sleep at midday would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day before The dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side Tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom but a very long lime ago He seemed to remember something sad about it and would not say much They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall and then Tom turned due north for they had been bearing somewhat to the west The land was now open and fairly level and they quickened their pace but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead and they knew that they had come back to the Road after many unexpected adventures They galloped their ponies over the last furlongs and halted under the long shadows of the trees They were on the top of a sloping bank and the Road now dim as evening drew on wound away below them At this point it ran nearly from Southwest to Northeast and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow It was rutted and bore many signs of the recent heavy rain there were pools and potholes full of water They rode down the bank and looked up and down There was nothing to be seen Well here we are again at last said Frodo I suppose we havent lost more than two days by my short cut through the Forest But perhaps the delay will prove useful it may have put them off our trail The others looked at him The shadow of the fear of the Black Riders came suddenly over them again Ever since they had entered the Forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road only now when it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them and was more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the Road itself They looked anxiously back towards the setting sun but the Road was brown and empty Do you think asked Pippin hesitatingly do you think we may be pursued tonight No I hope not tonight answered Tom Bombadil nor perhaps the next day But do not trust my guess for I cannot tell for certain Out east my knowledge fails Tom is not master of Riders from the Black Land far beyond his country All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them They felt that he would know how to deal with Black Riders if anyone did They would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them and beyond all but the most vague and distant legends of the Shire and in the gathering twilight they longed for home A deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them They stood silent reluctant to make the final parting and only slowly became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell and telling them to have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting Tom will give you good advice till this day is over after that your own luck must go with you and guide you four miles along the Road youll come upon a village Bree under Breehill with doors looking westward There youll find an old inn that is called _The Prancing Pony_ Barliman Butterbur is the worthy keeper There you can stay the night and afterwards the morning will speed you upon your way Be bold but wary Keep up your merry hearts and ride to meet your fortune They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more with them but he laughed and refused saying Toms country ends here he will not pass the borders Tom has his house to mind and Goldberry is waiting Then he turned tossed up his hat leaped on Lumpkins back and rode up over the bank and away singing into the dusk The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil said Sam Hes a caution and no mistake I reckon we may go a good deal further and see naught better nor queerer But I wont deny Ill be glad to see this _Prancing Pony_he spoke of I hope itll be like _The Green Dragon_ away back home What sort of folk are they in Bree There are hobbits in Bree said Merry as well as Big Folk I daresay it will be homelike enough _The Pony_ is a good inn by all accounts My people ride out there now and again It may be all we could wish said Frodo but it is outside the Shire all the same Dont make yourselves too much at home Please remember all of you that the name of Baggins must NOT be mentioned I am Mr Underhill if any name must be given They now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening Darkness came down quickly as they plodded slowly downhill and up again until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead Before them rose Breehill barring the way a dark mass against misty stars and under its western flank nestled a large village Towards it they now hurried desiring only to find a fire and a door between them and the night _Chapter 9_ At the Sign of The Prancing Pony_ Bree was the chief village of the Breeland a small inhabited region like an island in the empty lands round about Besides Bree itself there was Staddle on the other side of the hill Combe in a deep valley a little further eastward and Archet on the edge of the Chetwood Lying round Breehill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland only a few miles broad The Men of Bree were brownhaired broad and rather short cheerful and independent they belonged to nobody but themselves but they were more friendly and familiar with Hobbits Dwarves Elves and other inhabitants of the world about them than was or is usual with Big People According to their own tales they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants of the first Men that ever wandered into the West of the middleworld Few had survived the turmoils of the Elder Days but when the Kings returned again over the Great Sea they had found the Breemen still there and they were still there now when the memory of the old Kings had faded into the grass In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west or within a hundred leagues of the Shire But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers The Breefolk called them Rangers and knew nothing of their origin They were taller and darker than the Men of Bree and were believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing and to understand the languages of beasts and birds They roamed at will southwards and eastwards even as far as the Misty Mountains but they were now few and rarely seen When they appeared they brought news from afar and told strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to but the Breefolk did not make friends of them There were also many families of hobbits in the Breeland and _they_claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world one that was founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed and the Shire colonized They lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree itself especially on the higher slopes of the hill above the houses of the Men The Big Folk and the Little Folk as they called one another were on friendly terms minding their own affairs in their own ways but both rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the Breefolk Nowhere else in the world was this peculiar but excellent arrangement to be found The Breefolk Big and Little did not themselves travel much and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concern Occasionally the Hobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland or the Eastfarthing but though their link land was not much further than a days riding east of the Brandywine Bridge the Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited it An occasional Bucklander or adventurous Took would come out to the Inn for a night or two but even that was becoming less and less usual The Shirehobbits referred to those of Bree and to any others that lived beyond the borders as Outsiders and took very little interest in them considering them dull and uncouth There were probably many more Outsiders scattered about in the West of the World in those days than the people of the Shire imagined Some doubtless were no better than tramps ready to dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them But in the Breeland at any rate the hobbits were decent and prosperous and no more rustic than most of their distant relatives Inside It was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between the Shire and Bree There was Breeblood in the Brandybucks by all accounts The village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big Folk mostly above the Road nestling on the hillside with windows looking west On that side running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to it there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side Over this the Road crossed by a causeway but where it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate There was another gate in the southern comer where the Road ran out of the village The gates were closed at nightfall but just inside them were small lodges for the gatekeepers Down on the Road where it swept to the right to go round the foot of the hill there was a large inn It had been built long ago when the traffic on the roads had been far greater For Bree stood at an old meeting of ways another ancient road crossed the East Road just outside he dike at the western end of the village and in former days Men and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on it _Strange as News from Bree_ was still a saying in the Eastfarthing descending from those days when news from North South and East could be heard in the inn and when the Shirehobbits used to go more often to hear it But the Northern Lands had long been desolate and the North Road was now seldom used it was grassgrown and the Breefolk called it the Greenway The Inn of Bree was still there however and the innkeeper was an important person His house was a meeting place for the idle talkative and inquisitive among the inhabitants large and small of the four villages and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers and for such travellers mostly dwarves as still journeyed on the East Road to and from the Mountains It was dark and white stars were shining when Frodo and his companions came at last to the Greenwaycrossing and drew near the village They came to the Westgate and found it shut but at the door of the lodge beyond it there was a man sitting He jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at them in surprise What do you want and where do you come from he asked gruffly We are making for the inn here answered Frodo We are journeying east and cannot go further tonight Hobbits Four hobbits And whats more out of the Shire by their talk said the gatekeeper softly as if speaking to himself He stared at them darkly for a moment and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride through We dont often see Shirefolk riding on the Road at night he went on as they halted a moment by his door Youll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east of Bree What may your names be might I ask Our names and our business are our own and this does not seem a good place to discuss them said Frodo not liking the look of the man or the tone of his voice Your business is your own no doubt said the man but its my business to ask questions after nightfall We are hobbits from Buckland and we have a fancy to travel and to stay at the inn here put in Merry I am Mr Brandybuck Is that enough for you The Breefolk used to be fairspoken to travellers or so I had heard All right all right said the man I meant no offence But youll find maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be asking you questions Theres queer folk about If you go on to _The Pony_ youll find youre oat the only guests He wished them good night and they said no more but Frodo could see in the lanternlight that the man was still eyeing them curiously He was glad to hear the gate clang to behind them as they rode forward He wondered why the man was so suspicious and whether any one had been asking for _news of_ a party of hobbits Could it have been Gandalf He might have arrived while they were delayed in the Forest and the Downs But there was something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy The man stared after the hobbits for a moment and then he went back to his house As soon as his back was turned a dark figure climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope passing a few detached houses and drew up outside the inn The houses looked large and strange to them Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows and felt his heart sink He had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees and other creatures even more terrifying some time or other in the course of his journey but at the moment he was finding his first sight of Men and their tall houses quite enough indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day He pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the innyard and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows We surely arent going to stay here for the night are we sir he exclaimed If there are hobbitfolk in these pans why dont we look for some that would be willing to take us in It would be more homelike Whats wrong with the inn said Frodo Tom Bombadil recommended it I expect its homelike enough inside Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes It had a front on the Road and two wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill so that at the rear the secondfloor windows were level with the ground There was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between the two wings and on the left under the arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps The door was open and light streamed out of it Above the arch there was a lamp and beneath it swung a large signboard a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs Over the door was painted in white letters THE PRANCING PONY by BARLIMAN BUTTERBUR Many of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains As they hesitated outside in the gloom someone began singing a merry song inside and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus They listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their ponies The song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping They led their ponies under the arch and leaving them standing in the yard they climbed up the steps Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red face He had a white apron on and was bustling out of one door and in through another carrying a tray laden with full mugs Can we began Frodo Half a minute if you please shouted the man over his shoulder and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke In a moment he was out again wiping his hands on his apron Good evening little master he said bending down What may you be wanting Beds for four and stabling for five ponies if that can be managed Are you Mr Butterbur Thats right Barliman is my name Barliman Butterbur at your service Youre from the Shire eh he said and then suddenly he clapped his hand to his forehead as if trying to remember something Hobbits he cried Now what does that remind me of Might I ask your names sir Mr Took and Mr Brandybuck said Frodo and this is Sam Gamgee My name is Underhill There now said Mr Butterbur snapping his fingers Its gone again But itll come back when I have time to think Im run off my feet but Ill see what I can do for you We dont often get a party out of the Shire nowadays and I should be sorry not to make you welcome But there is such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasnt been for long enough It never rains but it pours we say in Bree Hi Nob he shouted Where are you you woollyfooted slowcoach Nob Coming sir Coming A cheerylooking hobbit bobbed out of a door and seeing the travellers stopped short and stared at them with great interest Wheres Bob asked the landlord You dont know Well find him Double sharp I havent got six legs nor six eyes neither Tell Bob theres five ponies that have to be stabled He must find room somehow Nob trotted off with a grin and a wink Well now what was I going to say said Mr Butterbur tapping his forehead One thing drives out another so to speak Im that busy tonight my head is going round Theres a party that came up the Greenway from down South last night and that was strange enough to begin with Then theres a travelling company of dwarves going West come in this evening And now theres you If you werent hobbits I doubt if we could house you But weve got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for hobbits when this place was built On the ground floor as they usually prefer round windows and all as they like it I hope youll be comfortable Youll be wanting supper I dont doubt As soon as may be This way now He led them a short way down a passage and opened a door Here is a nice little parlour he said I hope it will suit Excuse me now Im that busy No time for talking I must be trotting Its hard work for two legs but I dont get thinner Ill look in again later If you want anything ring the handbell and Nob will come If he dont come ring and shout Off he went at last and left them feeling rather breathless He seemed capable of an endless stream of talk however busy he might be They found themselves in a small and cosy room There was a bit of bright fire burning on the hearth and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs There was a round table already spread with a white cloth and on it was a large handbell But Nob the hobbit servant came bustling in long before they thought of ringing He brought candles and a tray full of plates Will you be wanting anything to drink masters he asked And shall I show you the bedrooms while your supper is got ready They were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr Butterbur and Nob came in again In a twinkling the table was laid There was hot soup cold meats a blackberry tart new loaves slabs of butter and half a ripe cheese good plain food as good as the Shire could show and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sams misgivings already much relieved by the excellence of the beer The landlord hovered round for a link and then prepared to leave them I dont know whether you would care to join the company when you have supped he said standing at the door Perhaps you would rather go to your beds Still the company would be very pleased to welcome you__ if you had a mind We dont get Outsiders travellers from the Shire I should say begging your pardon often and we like to hear a bit of news or any story or song you may have in mind But as you please Ring the bell if you lack anything So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper about three quarters of an hours steady going not hindered by unnecessary talk that Frodo Pippin and Sam decided to join the company Merry said it would be too stuffy I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air Mind your Ps and Qs and dont forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret and are still _on_ the highroad and not very far from the Shire All right said Pippin Mind yourself Dont get lost and dont forget that it is safer indoors The company was in the big commonroom of the inn The gathering was large and mixed as Frodo discovered when his eyes got used to the light This came chiefly from a blazing logfire for the three lamps hanging from the beams were dim and half veiled in smoke Barliman Butterbur was standing near the fire talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two strangelooking men On the benches were various folk men of Bree a collection of local hobbits sitting chattering together a few more dwarves and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows and comers As soon as the Shirehobbits entered there was a chorus of welcome from the Breelanders The strangers especially those that had come up the Greenway stared at them curiously The landlord introduced the newcomers to the Breefolk so quickly that though they caught many names they were seldom sure who the names belonged to The Men of Bree seemed all to have rather botanical and to the Shirefolk rather odd names like Rushlight Goatleaf Heathertoes Appledore Thistlewool and Ferny not to mention Butterbur Some of the hobbits had similar names The Mugworts for instance seemed numerous But most of them had natural names such as Banks Brockhouse Longholes Sandheaver and Tunnelly many of which were used in the Shire There were several Underhills from Saddle and as they could not imagine sharing a name without being related they took Frodo to their hearts as a longlost cousin The Breehobbits were in fact friendly and inquisitive and Frodo soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be given He gave out that he was interested in history and geography at which there was much wagging of heads although neither of these words were much used in the Breedialect He said he was thinking of writing a book at which there was silent astonishment _and_ that he and his friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outside the Shire especially in the eastern lands At this a chorus of voices broke out If Frodo had really wanted to write a book and had had many ears he would have learned enough for several chapters in a few minutes And if that was not enough he was given a whole list of names beginning with Old Barliman here to whom he could go for further information But after a time as Frodo did not show any _sign_ of writing a book on the spot the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in the Shire Frodo did not prove very communicative and he soon found himself sitting alone in a comer listening and looking around The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar There was trouble away in the South and it seemed that the Men who had come up the Greenway were on the move looking for lands where they could find some peace The Breefolk were sympathetic but plainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into their little land One of the travellers a squinteyed illfavoured fellow was foretelling that more and more people would be coming north in the near future If room isnt found for them theyll find it for themselves Theyve a right to live same as other folk he said loudly The local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect The hobbits did not pay much attention to all this and it did not at the moment seem to concern hobbits Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbitholes They were more interested in Sam and Pippin who were now feeling quite at home and were chatting gaily about events in the Shire Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the roof of the Town Hole in Michel Delving Will Whitfoot the Mayor and the fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing had been buried in chalk and came out like a floured dumpling But there were several questions asked that made Frodo a little uneasy One of the Breelanders who seemed to have been in the Shire several times wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who they were related to Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strangelooking weatherbeaten man sitting in the shadows near the wall was also listening intently to the hobbittalk He had a tall tankard in front of him and was smoking a longstemmed pipe curiously carved His legs were stretched out before him showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well but had seen much wear and were now caked with mud A travelstained cloak of heavy darkgreen cloth was drawn close about him and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits Who is that Frodo asked when he got a chance to whisper to Mr Butterbur I dont think you introduced him Him said the landlord in an answering whisper cocking an eye without turning his head I dont rightly know He is one of the wandering folk Rangers we call them He seldom talks not but what he can tell a rare tale when he has the mind He disappears for a month or a year and then he pops up again He was in and out pretty often last spring but I havent seen him about lately What his right name is Ive never heard but hes known round here as Strider Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry But theres no accounting for East and West as we say in Bree meaning the Rangers and the Shirefolk begging your pardon Funny you should ask about him But at that moment Mr Butterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unexplained Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him as if he had heard or guessed all that had been said Presently with a wave of his hand and a nod he invited Frodo to come over and sit by him As Frodo drew near be threw back his hood showing a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes I am called Strider he said in a low voice I am very pleased to meet you Master Underhill if old Butterbur got your name right He did said Frodo stiffly He felt far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyes Well Master Underhill said Strider if I were you I should stop your young friends from talking too much Drink__ fire and chancemeeting are pleasant enough but well this isnt the Shire There are queer folk about Though I say it as shouldnt you may think he added with a wry smile seeing Frodos glance And there have been even stranger travellers through Bree lately he went on watching Frodos face Frodo returned his gaze but said nothing and Strider made no further sign His attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin To his alarm Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took encouraged by his success with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving was now actually giving a comic account of Bilbos farewell party He was already giving an imitation of the Speech and was drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance Frodo was annoyed It was a harmless enough tale for most of the local hobbits no doubt just a funny story about those funny people away beyond the River but some old Butterbur for instance knew a thing or two and had probably heard rumours long ago about Bilbos vanishing It would bring the name of Baggins to their minds especially if there had been inquiries in Bree after that name Frodo fidgeted wondering what to do Pippin was evidently much enjoying the attention he was getting and had become quite forgetful of their danger Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even mention the Ring and that might well be disastrous You had better do something quick whispered Strider in his ear Frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk The attention of Pippins audience was disturbed Some of the hobbits looked at Frodo and laughed and clapped thinking that Mr Underhill had taken as much ale as was good for him Frodo suddenly felt very foolish and found himself as was his habit when making a speech fingering the things in his pocket He felt the Ring on its chain and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly situation It seemed to him somehow as if me suggestion came to him from outside from someone or something a the room He resisted the temptation firmly and clasped the Ring in his hand as if to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing _any_ mischief At any rate it gave him no inspiration He spoke a few suitable words as they would have said in the Shire _We are all very much gratified by the kindness of your reception and I venture to hope that my brief visit will help to renew the old ties of friendship between the Shire and Bree_and then he hesitated and coughed Everyone in the room was now looking at him A song shouted one of the hobbits A song A song shouted all the others Come on now master sing us something that we havent heard before For a moment Frodo stood gaping Then in desperation he began a ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of and indeed rather proud of for he had made up the words himself It was about an inn and that is probably why it came into Frodos mind just then Here it is in full Only a few words of it are now as a rule remembered There is an inn a merry old inn beneath an old grey hill And there they brew a beer so brown That the Man in the Moon himself came down one night to drink his fill The ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a fivestringed fiddle And up and down he runs his bow Now squeaking high now purring low now sawing in the middle The landlord keeps a little dog that is mighty fond of jokes When theres good cheer among the guests He cocks an ear at all the jests and laughs until he chokes They also keep a horned cow as proud as any queen But music turns her head like ale And makes her wave her tufted tail and dance upon the green And O the rows of silver dishes and the store of silver spoons For Sunday theres a special pair And these they polish up with care on Saturday afternoons The Man in the Moon was drinking deep and the cat began to wail A dish and a spoon on the table danced The cow in the garden madly pranced and the little dog chased his tail The Man in the Moon took another mug and then rolled beneath his chair And there he dozed and dreamed of ale Till in the sky the stars were pale and dawn was in the air Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat The white horses of the Moon They neigh and champ their silver bits But their masters been and drowned his wits and the Sunll be rising soon So the cat on his fiddle played heydiddlediddle a jig that would wake the dead He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon Its after three he said They rolled the Man slowly up the hill and bundled him into the Moon While his horses galloped up in rear And the cow came capering like a deer and a dish ran up with the spoon Now quicker the fiddle went deedledumdiddle the dog began to roar The cow and the horses stood on their heads The guests all bounded from their beds and danced upon the floor With a ping and a pong the fiddlestrings broke the cow jumped over the Moon And the little dog laughed to see such fun And the Saturday dish went off at a run with the silver Sunday spoon The round Moon rolled behind the hill as the Sun raised up her head She hardly believed her fiery eyes For though it was day to her surprise they all went back to bed There was loud and long applause Frodo had a good voice and the song tickled their fancy Wheres old Barley they cried He ought to hear this Bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle and then wed have a dance They called for more ale and began to shout Lets have it again master Come on now Once more They made Frodo have another drink and then begin his song again while many of them joined in for the tune was well known and they were quick at picking up words It was now Frodos turn to feel pleased with himself He capered about on the table and when he came a second time to _the cow jumped over the Moon_ he leaped in the air Much too vigorously for he came down bang into a tray full of mugs and slipped and rolled off the table with a crash clatter and bump The audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter and stopped short a gaping silence for the singer disappeared He simply vanished as if he had gone slap through the floor without leaving a hole The local hobbits stared in amazement and then sprang to their feet and shouted for Barliman All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam who found themselves left alone in a comer and eyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance It was plain that many people regarded them now as the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose But there was one swarthy Breelander who stood looking at them with a knowing and halfmocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable Presently he slipped out of the door followed by the squinteyed southerner the two had been whispering together a good deal during the evening Harry the gatekeeper also went out just behind them Frodo felt a fool Not knowing what else to do he crawled away under the tables to the dark comer by Strider who sat unmoved giving no sign of his thoughts Frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the Ring How it came to be on his finger he could not tell He could only suppose that he had been handling it in his pocket while he sang and that somehow it had slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall For a moment he wondered if the Ring itself had not played him a trick perhaps it had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt in the room He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out Well said Strider when he reappeared Why did you do that Worse than anything your friends could have said You have put your foot in it Or should I say your finger I dont know what you mean said Frodo annoyed and alarmed Oh yes you do answered Strider but we had better wait until the uproar has died down Then if you please Mr _Baggins I_ should like a quiet word with you What about asked Frodo ignoring the sudden use of his proper name A matter of some importance to us both answered Strider looking Frodo in the eye You may hear something to your advantage Very well said Frodo trying to appear unconcerned Ill talk to you later Meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace Mr Butterbur had come trotting in and he was now trying to listen to several conflicting accounts of the event at the same time I saw him Mr Butterbur said a hobbit or leastways I didnt see him if you take my meaning He just vanished into thin air in a manner of speaking You dont say Mr Mugwort said the landlord looking puzzled Yes I do replied Mugwort And I mean what I say whats more Theres some mistake somewhere said Butterbur shaking his head There was too much of that Mr Underhill to go vanishing into thin air or into thick air as is more likely in this room Well where is he now cried several voices How should I know Hes welcome to go where he will so long as he pays in the morning Theres Mr Took now hes not vanished Well I saw what I saw and I saw what I didnt said Mugwort obstinately And I say theres some mistake repeated Butterbur picking up the tray and gathering up the broken crockery Of course theres a mistake said Frodo I havent vanished Here I am Ive just been having a few words with Strider in the comer He came forward into the firelight but most of the company backed away__ even more perturbed than before They were not in the least satisfied by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after he had fallen Most of the Hobbits and the Men of Bree went off then and there in a huff having no fancy for further entertainment that evening One or two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves The Dwarves and the two or three strange Men that still remained got up and said good night to the landlord but not to Frodo and his friends Before long no one was left but Strider who sat on unnoticed by the wall Mr Butterbur did not seem much put out He reckoned very probably that his house would be full again on many future nights until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed Now what have you been doing Mr Underhill he asked Frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks with your acrobatics I am very sorry to have caused any trouble said Frodo It was quite unintentional I assure you A most unfortunate accident All right Mr Underhill But if youre going to do any more tumbling or conjuring or whatever it was youd best warn folk beforehand and warn _me_ Were a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way uncanny if you understand me and we dont take to it all of a sudden I shant be doing anything of the sort again Mr Butterbur I promise you And now I think Ill be getting to bed We shall be making an early start Will you see that our ponies are ready by eight oclock Very good But before you go I should like a word with you in private Mr Underhill Something has just come back to my mind that I ought to tell you I hope that youll not take it amiss When Ive seen to a thing or two Ill come along to your room if youre willing Certainly said Frodo but his heart sank He wondered how many private talks he would have before he got to bed and what they would reveal Were these people all in league against him He began to suspect even old Butterburs fat face of concealing dark designs _Chapter 10_ Strider Frodo Pippin and Sam made their way back to the parlour There was no light Merry was not there and the fire had burned low It was not until they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots that they discovered Strider had come with them There he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door Hallo said Pippin Who are you and what do you want I am called Strider he answered and though he may have forgotten it your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me You said I might hear something to my advantage I believe said Frodo What have you to say Several things answered Strider But of course I have my price What do you mean asked Frodo sharply Dont be alarmed I mean just this I will tell you what I know and give you some good advice but I shall want a reward And what will that be pray said Frodo He suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little money with him All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue and he could not spare any of it No more than you can afford answered Strider with a slow smile as if he guessed Frodos thoughts Just this you must take me along with you until I wish to leave you Oh indeed replied Frodo surprised but not much relieved Even if I wanted another companion I should not agree to any such thing until I knew a good deal more about you and your business Excellent exclaimed Strider crossing his legs and sitting back comfortably You seem to be coming to your senses again and that is all to the good You have been much too careless so far Very well I will tell you what I know and leave the reward to you You may be glad to grant it when you have heard me Go on then said Frodo What do you know Too much too many dark things said Strider grimly But as for your business He got up and went to the door opened it quickly and looked out Then he shut it quietly and sat down again I have quick ears he went on lowering his voice and though I cannot disappear I have hunted many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen if I wish Now I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree when four hobbits came out of the Downlands I need not repeat all that they said to old Bombadil or to one another but one thing interested me _Please remember_ said one of them _that the name Baggins must not be mentioned I am Mr Underhill if any name must be given_ That interested me so much that I followed them here I slipped over the gate just behind them Maybe Mr Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind but if so I should advise him and his friends to be more careful I dont see what interest my name has for any one in Bree said Frodo angrily and I have still to learn why it interests you Mr Strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping but if so I should advise him to explain it Well answered said Strider laughing But the explanation is simple I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins I wanted to find him quickly I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire well a secret that concerned me and my friends Now dont mistake me he cried as Frodo rose from his seat and Sam jumped up with a scowl I shall take more care of the secret than you do And care is needed He leaned forward and looked at them Watch every shadow he said in a low voice Black horsemen have passed through Bree On Monday one came down the Greenway they say and another appeared later coming up the Greenway from the south There was a silence At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam I ought to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us he said And the landlord seems to have heard something Why did he press us to join the company And why on earth did we behave so foolishly we ought to have stayed quiet in here It would have been better said Strider I would have stopped your going into the commonroom if I could but the innkeeper would not let me in to see you or take a message Do you think he began Frodo No I dont think any harm of old Butterbur Only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort Frodo gave him a puzzled look Well I have rather a rascally look have I not said Strider with a curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye But I hope we shall get to know one another better When we do I hope you will explain what happened at the end of your song For that little prank It was sheer accident interrupted Frodo I wonder said Strider Accident then That accident has made your position dangerous Hardly more than it was already said Frodo I knew these horsemen were pursuing me but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to have gone away You must not count on that said Strider sharply They will return And more are coming There are others I know their number I know these Riders He paused and his eyes were cold and hard And there are some folk in Bree who are not to be trusted he went on Bill Ferny for instance He has an evil name in the Breeland and queer folk call at his house You must have noticed him among the company a swarthy sneering fellow He was very close with one of the Southern strangers and they slipped out together just after your accident Not all of those Southerners mean well and as for Ferny he would sell anything to anybody or make mischief for amusement What will Ferny sell and what has my accident got to do with him said Frodo still determined not to understand Striders hints News of you of course answered Strider An account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people After that they would hardly need to be told your real name It seems to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over Is that enough You can do as you like about my reward take me as a guide or not But I may say that I know all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains for I have wandered over them for many years I am older than I look I might prove useful You will have to leave the open road after tonight for the horsemen will watch it night and day You may escape from Bree and be allowed to go forward while the Sun is up but you wont go far They will come on you in the wild in some dark place where there is no help Do you wish them to find you They are terrible The hobbits looked at him and saw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain and his hands clenched the arms of his chair The room was very quiet and still and the light seemed to have grown dim For a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the Night far away There he cried after a moment drawing his hand across his brow Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do You fear them but you do not fear them enough yet Tomorrow you will have to escape if you can Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden Will you have him There was a heavy silence Frodo made no answer his mind was confused with doubt and fear Sam frowned and looked at his master and at last he broke out With your leave Mr Frodo Id say no This Strider here he warns and he says take care and I _say yes_ to that and lets begin with him He comes out of the Wild and I never heard no good of such folk He knows something thats plain and more than I like but its no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help as he puts it Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable Strider did not reply to Sam but turned his keen eyes on Frodo Frodo caught his glance and looked away No he said slowly I dont agree I think I think you are not really as you choose to look You began to talk to me like the Breefolk but your voice has changed Still Sam seems right in this I dont see why you should warn us to take care and yet ask us to take you on trust Why the disguise Who are you What do you really know about about my business and how do you know it The lesson in caution has been well learned said Strider with a grim smile But caution is one thing and wavering is another You will never get to Rivendell now on your own and to trust me is your only chance You must make up your mind I will answer some of your questions if that will help you to do so But why should you believe my story if you do not trust me already Still here it is At that moment there came a knock at the door Mr Butterbur had arrived with candles and behind him was Nob with cans of hot water Strider withdrew into a dark corner Ive come to bid you good night said the landlord putting the candles on the table Nob Take the water to the rooms He came in and shut the door Its like this he began hesitating and looking troubled If Ive done any harm Im sorry indeed But one thing drives out another as youll admit and Im a busy man But first one thing and then another this week have jogged my memory as the saying goes and not too late I hope You see I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire and for one by the name of Baggins in particular And what has that got to do with me asked Frodo Ah you know best said the landlord knowingly I wont give you away but I was told that this Baggins would be going by the name of Underhill and I was given a description that fits you well enough if I may say so Indeed Lets have it then said Frodo unwisely interrupting _A stout little fellow with red cheeks_ said Mr Butterbur solemnly Pippin chuckled but Sam looked indignant _That wont help you much it goes for most hobbits Barley_ he says to me continued Mr Butterbur with a glance at Pippin _But this one is taller than some and fairer than most and he has a cleft in his chin perky chap with a bright eye_ Begging your pardon but he said it not me _He_ said it And who was he asked Frodo eagerly Ah That was Gandalf if you know who I mean A wizard they say he is but hes a good friend of mine whether or no But now I dont know what hell have to say to me if I see him again turn all my ale sour or me into a block of wood I shouldnt wonder Hes a bit hasty Still whats done cant be undone Well what have you done said Frodo getting impatient with the slow unravelling of Butterburs thoughts Where was I said the landlord pausing and snapping his fingers Ah yes Old Gandalf Three months back he walked right into my room without a knock _Barley_ he says _Im off in the morning Will you do something for me Youve only to name it_ I said _Im in a hurry_ said he _and Ive no time myself but I want a message took to the Shire Have you anyone you can send and trust to go I can find someone_ I said _tomorrow maybe or the day after Make it tomorrow_ he says and then he gave me a letter Its addressed plain enough said Mr Butterbur producing a letter from his pocket and reading out the address slowly and proudly he valued his reputation as a lettered man _Mr FRODO BAGGINS BAG END HOBBITON in the SHIRE_ A letter for me from Gandalf cried Frodo Ah said Mr Butterbur Then your right name is Baggins It is said Frodo and you had better give me that letter at once and explain why you never sent it Thats what you came to tell me I suppose though youve taken a long time to come to the point Poor Mr Butterbur looked troubled Youre right master he said and I beg your pardon And Im mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say if harm comes of it But I didnt keep it back apurpose I put it by safe Then I couldnt find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day nor the day after and none of my own folk were to spare and then one thing after another drove it out of my mind Im a busy man Ill do what I can to set matters right and if theres any help I can give youve only to name it Leaving the letter aside I promised Gandalf no less _Barley_ he says to me _this friend of mine from the Shire he may be coming out this way before long him and another Hell be calling himself Underhill Mind that But you need ask no questions And if Im not with him he may be in trouble and he may need help Do whatever you can for him and Ill be grateful_ he says And here you are and trouble is not far off seemingly What do you mean asked Frodo These black men said the landlord lowering his voice Theyre looking for _Baggins_ and if they mean well then Im a hobbit It was on Monday and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming Uncanny I called it Nob he came and told me that two black men were at the door asking for a hobbit called Baggins Nobs hair was all stood on end I bid the black fellows be off and slammed the door on them but theyve been asking the same question all the way to Archet I hear And that Ranger Strider hes been asking questions too Tried to get in here to see you before youd had bite or sup he did He did said Strider suddenly coming forward into the light And much trouble would have been saved if you had let him in Barliman The landlord jumped with surprise You he cried Youre always popping up What do you want now Hes here with my leave said Frodo He came to offer me his help Well you know your own business maybe said Mr Butterbur looking suspiciously at Strider But if I was in your plight I wouldnt take up with a Ranger Then who would you take up with asked Strider A fat innkeeper who only remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day They cannot stay in _The Pony_ for ever and they cannot go home They have a long road before them Will you go with them and keep the black men off Me Leave Bree I wouldnt do that for any money said Mr Butterbur looking really scared But why cant you stay here quiet for a bit Mr Underhill What are all these queer goings on What are these black men after and where do they come from Id like to know Im sorry I cant explain it all answered Frodo I am tired and very worried and its a long tale But if you mean to help me I ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house These Black Riders I am not sure but I think I fear they come from They come from Mordor said Strider in a low voice From Mordor Barliman if that means anything to you Save us cried Mr Butterbur turning pale the name evidently was known to him That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time It is said Frodo Are you still willing to help me I am said Mr Butterbur More than ever Though I dont know what the likes of me can do against against he faltered Against the Shadow in the East said Strider quietly Not much Barliman but every little helps You can let Mr Underhill stay here tonight as Mr Underhill and you can forget the name of Baggins till he is far away Ill do that said Butterbur But theyll find out hes here without help from me Im afraid Its a pity Mr Baggins drew attention to himself this evening to say no more The story of that Mr Bilbos going off has been heard before tonight in Bree Even our Nob has been doing some guessing in his slow pate and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he is Well we can only hope the Riders wont come back yet said Frodo I hope not indeed said Butterbur But spooks or no spooks they wont get in _The Pony_so easy Dont you worry till the morning Nobll say no word No black man shall pass my doors while I can stand on my legs Me and my folkll keep watch tonight but you had best get some sleep if you can In any case we must be called at dawn said Frodo We must get off as early as possible Breakfast at sixthirty please Right Ill see to the orders said the landlord Good night Mr Baggins Underhill I should say Good night now bless me Wheres your Mr Brandybuck I dont know said Frodo with sudden anxiety They had forgotten all about Merry and it was getting late I am afraid he is out He said something about going for a breath of air Well you do want looking after and no mistake your party might be on a holiday said Butterbur I must go and bar the doors quick but Ill see your friend is let in when he comes Id better send Nob to look for him Good night to you all At last Mr Butterbur went out with another doubtful look at Strider and a shake of his head His footsteps retreated down the passage Well said Strider When are you going to open that letter Frodo looked carefully at the seal before he broke it It seemed certainly to be Gandalfs Inside written in the wizards strong but graceful script was the following message _THE PRANCING PONY BREE Midyears Day Shire Year 1418_ _Dear Frodo_ _Bad news has reached me here I must go off at once You had better leave Bag End soon and get out of the Shire before the end of July at latest I will return as soon as I can and I will follow you if I find that you are gone Leave a message for me here if you pass through Bree You can trust the landlord Butterbur You may meet a friend of mine on the Road a Man lean dark tall by some called Strider He knows our business and will help you Make for Rivendell There I hope we may meet again If I do not come Elrond will advise you_ _Yours in haste_ _GANDALF_ _PS Do NOT use It again not far any reason whatever Do not travel by night_ _PPS Make sure that it is the real Strider There are many strange men on the roads His true name is Aragorn_ All that is gold does not glitter Not all those who wander are lost The old that is strong does not wither Deep roots are not reached by the frost From the ashes a fire shall be woken A light from the shadows shall spring Renewed shall be blade that was broken The crownless again shall be king _PPPS I hope Butterbur sends this promptly A worthy man but his memory is like a lumberroom thing wanted always buried If he forgets I shall roast him_ _Fare Well_ Frodo read the letter to himself and then passed it to Pippin and Sam Really old Butterbur has made a mess of things he said He deserves roasting If I had got this at once we might all have been safe in Rivendell by now But what can have happened to Gandalf He writes as if he was going into great danger He has been doing that for many years said Strider Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully wondering about Gandalfs second postscript Why didnt you tell me that you were Gandalfs friend at once he asked It would have saved time Would it Would any of you have believed me till now said Strider I knew nothing of this letter For all I knew I had to persuade you to trust me without proofs if I was to help you In any case I did not intend to tell you all about myself at once I had to study _you_ first and make sure of you The Enemy has set traps for me before now As soon as I had made up my mind I was ready to tell you whatever you asked But I must admit he added with a queer laugh that I hoped you would take to me for my own sake A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship But there I believe my looks are against me They are at first sight at any rate laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalfs letter But handsome is as handsome does as we say in the Shire and I daresay we shall all look much the same after lying for days in hedges and ditches It would take more than a few days or weeks or years of wandering in the Wild to make you look like Strider he answered And you would die first unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be Pippin subsided but Sam was not daunted and he still eyed Strider dubiously How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about he demanded You never mentioned Gandalf till this letter came out You might be a playacting spy for all I can see trying to get us to go with you You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes What have you to say to that That you are a stout fellow answered Strider but I am afraid my only answer to you Sam Gamgee is this If I had killed the real Strider I could kill you And I should have killed you already without so much talk If I was after the Ring I could have it NOW He stood up and seemed suddenly to grow taller In his eyes gleamed a light keen and commanding Throwing back his cloak he laid his hand on the hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side They did not dare to move Sam sat widemouthed staring at him dumbly But I _am_ the real Strider fortunately he said looking down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile I am Aragorn son of Arathorn and if by life or death I can save you I will There was a long silence At last Frodo spoke with hesitation I believed that you were a friend before the letter came he said or at least I wished to You have frightened me several times tonight but never in the way that servants of the Enemy would or so I imagine I think one of his spies would well seem fairer and feel fouler if you understand I see laughed Strider I look foul and feel fair Is that it _All that is gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost_ Did the verses apply to you then asked Frodo I could not make out what they were about But how did you know that they were in Gandalfs letter if you have never seen it I did not know he answered But I am Aragorn and those verses go with that name He drew out his sword and they saw that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt Not much use is it Sam said Strider But the time is near when it shall be forged anew Sam said nothing Well said Strider with Sams permission we will call that settled Strider shall be your guide We shall have a rough road tomorrow Even if we are allowed to leave Bree unhindered we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible I know one or two ways out of Breeland other than the main road If once we shake off the pursuit I shall make for Weathertop Weathertop said Sam Whats that It is a hill just to the north of the Road about half way from here to Rivendell It commands a wide view all round and there we shall have a chance to look about us Gandalf will make for that point if he follows us After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult and we shall have to choose between various dangers When did you last see Gandalf asked Frodo Do you know where he is or what he is doing Strider looked grave I do not know he said I came west with him in the spring I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the last few years when he was busy elsewhere He seldom left it unguarded We last met on the first of May at Sam Ford down the Brandywine He told me that his business with you had gone well and that you would be starting for Rivendell in the last week of September As I knew he was at your side I went away on a journey of my own And that has proved ill for plainly some news reached him and I was not at hand to help I am troubled for the first time since I have known him We should have had messages even if he could not come himself When I returned many days ago I heard the ill news The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen It was the Elvenfolk of Gildor that told me this and later they told me that you had left your home but there was no news of your leaving Buckland I have been watching the East Road anxiously Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it with Gandalfs absence I mean asked Frodo I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him except the Enemy himself said Strider But do not give up hope Gandalf is greater than you Shirefolk know as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys But this business of ours will be his greatest task Pippin yawned I am sorry he said but I am dead tired In spite of all the danger and worry I must go to bed or sleep where I sit Where is that silly fellow Merry It would be the last straw if we had to go out in the dark to look for him At that moment they heard a door slam then feet came running along the passage Merry came in with a rush followed by Nob He shut the door hastily and leaned against it He was out of breath They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped I have seen them Frodo I have seen them Black Riders Black Riders cried Frodo Where Here In the village I stayed indoors for an hour Then as you did not come back I went out for a stroll I had come back again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars Suddenly I shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near there was a son of deeper shade among the shadows across the road just beyond the edge of the lamplight It slid away at once into the dark without a sound There was no horse Which way did it go asked Strider suddenly and sharply Merry started noticing the stranger for the first time Go on said Frodo This is a friend of Gandalfs I will explain later It seemed to make off up the Road eastward continued Merry I tried to follow Of course it vanished almost at once but I went round the corner and on as far as the last house on the Road Strider looked at Merry with wonder You have a stout heart he said but it was foolish I dont know said Merry Neither brave nor silly I think I could hardly help myself I seemed to be drawn somehow Anyway I went and suddenly I heard voices by the hedge One was muttering and the other was whispering or hissing I couldnt hear a word that was said I did not creep any closer because I began to tremble all over Then I felt terrified and I turned back and was just going to bolt home when something came behind me and I I fell over I found him sir put in Nob Mr Butterbur sent me out with a lantern I went down to Westgate and then back up towards Southgate Just nigh Bill Fernys house I thought I could see something in the Road I couldnt swear to it but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over something lilting it I gave a shout but where I got up to the spot there was no signs of them and only Mr Brandybuck lying by the roadside He seemed to be asleep I thought I had fallen into deep water he says to me when I shook him Very queer he was and as soon as I had roused him he got up and ran back here like a hare I am afraid thats true said Merry though I dont know what I said I had an ugly dream which I cant remember I went to pieces I dont know what came over me I do said Strider The Black Breath The Riders must have left their horses outside and passed back through the Southgate in secret They will know all the news now for they have visited Bill Ferny and probably that Southerner was a spy as well Something may happen in the night before we leave Bree What will happen said Merry Will they attack the inn No I think not said Strider They are not all here yet And in any case that is not their way In dark and loneliness they are strongest they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people not until they are desperate not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before us But their power is in terror and already some in Bree are in their clutch They will drive these wretches to some evil work Ferny and some of the strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too They had words with Harry at Westgate on Monday I was watching them He was white and shaking when they left him We seem to have enemies all round said Frodo What are we to do Stay here and do not go to your rooms They are sure to have found out which those are The hobbitrooms have windows looking north and close to the ground We will all remain together and bar this window and the door But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage While Strider was gone Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that had happened since supper Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalfs letter when Strider and Nob returned Well Masters said Nob Ive ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster down the middle of each bed And I made a nice imitation of your head with a brown woollen mat Mr Bag Underhill sir he added with a grin Pippin laughed Very lifelike he said But what will happen when they have penetrated the disguise We shall see said Strider Let us hope to hold the fort till morning Good night to you said Nob and went off to take his part in the watch on the doors Their bags and gear they piled on the parlourfloor They pushed a low chair against the door and shut the window Peering out Frodo saw that the night was still clear The Sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of Breehill He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the hearth but Strider settled himself in the chair against the door They talked for a little for Merry still had several questions to ask Jumped over the Moon chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in his blanket Very ridiculous of you Frodo But I wish I had been there to see The worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence I hope so said Strider Then they all fell silent and one by one the hobbits dropped off to sleep _Chapter 11_ A Knife in the Dark As they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree darkness lay on Buckland a mist strayed in the dells and along the riverbank The house at Crickhollow stood silent Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day and he was unable to rest or go to bed there was a brooding threat in the breathless nightair As he stared out into the gloom a black shadow moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound Terror seized him He shrank back and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall Then he shut and locked the door The night deepened There came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the lane Outside the gate they stopped and three black figures entered like shades of night creeping across the ground One went to the door one to the corner of the house on either side and there they stood as still as the shadows of stones while night went slowly on The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly There was a faint stir in the leaves and a cock crowed far away The cold hour before dawn was passing The figure by the door moved In the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed as if a chill light had been unsheathed There was a blow soft but heavy and the door shuddered Open in the name of Mordor said a voice thin and menacing At a second blow the door yielded and fell back with timbers burst and lock broken The black figures passed swiftly in At that moment among the trees nearby a horn rang out It rent the night like fire on a hilltop AWAKE FEAR FIRE FOES AWAKE Fatty Bolger had not been idle As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from the garden he knew that he must run for it or perish And run he did out of the back door through the garden and over the fields When he reached the nearest house more than a mile away he collapsed on the doorstep No no no he was crying No not me I havent got it It was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about At last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland some strange invasion from the Old Forest And then they lost no more time FEAR FIRE FOES The Brandybucks were blowing the Horncall of Buckland that had not been sounded for a hundred years not since the white wolves came in the Fell Winter when the Brandywine was frozen over AWAKE AWAKE Faraway answering horns were heard The alarm was spreading The black figures fled from the house One of them let fall a hobbitcloak on the step as he ran In the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and gathering to a gallop went hammering away into the darkness All about Crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing and voices crying and feet running But the Black Riders rode like a gale to the Northgate Let the little people blow Sauron would deal with them later Meanwhile they had another errand they knew now that the house was empty and the Ring had gone They rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire In the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep suddenly as if some sound or presence had disturbed him He saw that Strider was sitting alert in his chair his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire which had been tended and was burning brightly but he made no sign or movement Frodo soon went to sleep again but his dreams were again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs The wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly He opened his eyes and heard a cock crowing lustily in the innyard Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang The first grey light of day was in the room and a cold air was coming through the open window As soon as Strider had roused them all he led the way to their bedrooms When they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice the windows had been forced open and were swinging and the curtains were flapping the beds were tossed about and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the floor the brown mat was torn to pieces Strider immediately went to fetch the landlord Poor Mr Butterbur looked sleepy and frightened He had hardly closed his eyes all night so he said but he had never heard a sound Never has such a thing happened in my time he cried raising his hands in horror Guests unable to sleep in their beds and good bolsters ruined and all What are we coming to Dark times said Strider But for the present you may be left in peace when you have got rid of us We will leave at once Never mind about breakfast a drink and a bite standing will have to do We shall be packed in a few minutes Mr Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready and to fetch them a bite But very soon he came back in dismay The ponies had vanished The stabledoors had all been opened in the night and they were gone not only Merrys ponies but every other horse and beast in the place Frodo was crushed by the news How could they hope to reach Rivendell on foot pursued by mounted enemies They might as well set out for the Moon Strider sat silent for a while looking at the hobbits as if he was weighing up their strength and courage Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen he said at last thoughtfully as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind We should not go much slower on foot not on the roads that I mean to take I was going to walk in any case It is the food and stores that trouble me We cannot count on getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell except what we take with us and we ought to take plenty to spare for we may be delayed or forced to go roundabout far out of the direct way How much are you prepared to carry on your backs As much as we must said Pippin with a sinking heart but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked or felt I can carry enough for two said Sam defiantly Cant anything be done Mr Butterbur asked Frodo Cant we get a couple of ponies in the village or even one just for the baggage I dont suppose we could hire them but we might be able to buy them he added doubtfully wondering if he could afford it I doubt it said the landlord unhappily The two or three ridingponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard and theyre gone As for other animals horses or ponies for draught or what not there are very few of them in Bree and they wont be for sale But Ill do what I can Ill rout out Bob and send him round as soon as may be Yes said Strider reluctantly you had better do that I am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least But so ends all hope of starting early and slipping away quietly We might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure That was part of their plan no doubt There is one crumb of comfort said Merry and more than a crumb I hope we can have breakfast while we wait and sit down to it Lets get hold of Nob In the end there was more than three hours delay Bob came back with the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood except one Bill Ferny had one that he might possibly sell A poor old halfstarved creature it is said Bob but he wont part with it for less than thrice its worth seeing how youre placed not if I knows Bill Ferny Bill Ferny said Frodo Isnt there some trick Wouldnt the beast bolt back to him with all our stuff or help in tracking us or something I wonder said Strider But I cannot imagine any animal running home to him once it got away I fancy this is only an afterthought of kind Master Fernys just a way of increasing his profits from the affair The chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at deaths door But there does not seem any choice What does he want for it Bill Fernys price was twelve silver pennies and that was indeed at least three times the ponys value in those pans It proved to be a bony underfed and dispirited animal but it did not look like dying just yet Mr Butterbur paid for it himself and offered Merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals He was an honest man and welloff as things were reckoned in Bree but thirty silver pennies was a sore blow to him and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder to bear As a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end It turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen The others had been driven off or had bolted in terror and were found wandering in different corners of the Breeland Merrys ponies had escaped altogether and eventually having a good deal of sense they made their way to the Downs in search of Fatty Lumpkin So they came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a while and were welloff But when news of the events at Bree came to Toms ears he sent them to Mr Butterbur who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price They had to work harder in Bree but Bob treated them well so on the whole they were lucky they missed a dark and dangerous journey But they never came to Rivendell However in the meanwhile for all Mr Butterbur knew his money was gone for good or for bad And he had other troubles For there was a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the inn The southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed the innkeeper loudly until it became known that one of their own number had also disappeared in the night none other than Bill Fernys squinteyed companion Suspicion fell on him at once If you pick up with a horsethief and bring him to my house said Butterbur angrily you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me Go and ask Ferny where your handsome friend is But it appeared that he was nobodys friend and nobody could recollect when he had joined their party After their breakfast the hobbits had to repack and get together further supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting It was close on ten oclock before they at last got off By that time the whole of Bree was buzzing with excitement Frodos vanishing trick the appearance of the black horsemen the robbing of the stables and not least the news that Strider the Ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years Most of the inhabitants of Bree and Staddle and many even from Combe and Archet were crowded in the road to see the travellers start The other guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windows Strider had changed his mind and he decided to leave Bree by the main road Any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters worse half the inhabitants would follow them to see what they were up to and to prevent them from trespassing They said farewell to Nob and Bob and took leave of Mr Butterbur with many thanks I hope we shall meet again some day when things are merry once more said Frodo I should like nothing better than to stay in your house in peace for a while They tramped off anxious and downhearted under the eyes of the crowd Not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted But Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Breelanders and those that he stared at shut their mouths and drew away He walked in front with Frodo next came Merry and Pippin and last came Sam leading the pony which was laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it but already it looked less dejected as if it approved of the change in its fortunes Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully He had a pocket full of them a parting present from Nob and Bob Apples for walking and a pipe for sitting he said But I reckon Ill miss them both before long The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of doors or popped over walls and fences as they passed But as they drew near to the further gate Frodo saw a dark illkept house behind a thick hedge the last house in the village In one of the windows he caught a glimpse of a sallow face with sly slanting eyes but it vanished at once So thats where that southerner is hiding he thought He looks more than half like a goblin Over the hedge another man was staring boldly He had heavy black brows and dark scornful eyes his large mouth curled in a sneer He was smoking a short black pipe As they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat Morning Longshanks he said Off early Found some friends at last Strider nodded but did not answer Morning my little friends he said to the others I suppose you know who youve taken up with Thats Stickatnaught Strider that is Though Ive heard other names not so pretty Watch out tonight And you Sammie dont go illtreating my poor old pony Pah He spat again Sam turned quickly And you Ferny he said put your ugly face out of sight or it will get hurt With a sudden flick quick as lightning an apple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose He ducked too late and curses came from behind the hedge Waste of a good apple said Sam regretfully and strode on At last they left the village behind The escort of children and stragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back at the Southgate Passing through they kept on along the Road for some miles It bent to the left curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet of Breehill and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded country To their left they could see some of the houses and hobbitholes of Staddle on the gentler southeastern slopes of the hill down in a deep hollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where Combe lay Archet was hidden in the trees beyond After the Road had run down some way and had left Breehill standing tall and brown behind they came on a narrow track that led off towards the North This is where we leave the open and take to cover said Strider Not a short cut I hope said Pippin Our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster Ah but you had not got me with you then laughed Strider My cuts short or long dont go wrong He took a look up and down the Road No one was in sight and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley His plan as far as they could understand it without knowing the country was to go towards Archet at first but to bear right and pass it on the east and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to Weathertop Hill In that way they would if all went well cut off a great loop of the Road which further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater Marshes But of course they would have to pass through the marshes themselves and Striders description of them was not encouraging However in the meanwhile walking was not unpleasant Indeed if it had not been for the disturbing events of the night before they would have enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to that time The sun was shining clear but not too hot The woods in the valley were still leafy and full of colour and seemed peaceful and wholesome Strider guided them confidently among the many crossing paths although left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss He was taking a wandering course with many turns and doublings to put off any pursuit Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road for certain he said though I dont think he will follow us himself He knows the land round here well enough but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood It is what he may tell others that I am afraid of I dont suppose they are far away If they think we have made for Archet so much the better Whether because of Striders skill or for some other reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day neither twofooted except birds nor fourfooted except one fox and a few squirrels The next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards and still all was quiet and peaceful On the third day out from Bree they came out of the Chetwood The land had been falling steadily ever since they turned aside from the Road and they now entered a wide flat expanse of country much more difficult to manage They were far beyond the borders of the Breeland out in the pathless wilderness and drawing near to the Midgewater Marshes The ground now became damp and in places boggy and here and there they came upon pools and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of little hidden birds They had to pick their way carefully to keep both dryfooted and on their proper course At first they made fanprogress but as they went on their passage became slower and more dangerous The marshes were bewildering and treacherous and there was no permanent trail even for Rangers to find through their shifting quagmires The flies began to torment them and the air was full of clouds of tiny midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hair I am being eaten alive cried Pippin Midgewater There are more midges than water What do they live on when they cant get hobbit asked Sam scratching his neck They spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country Their campingplace was damp cold and uncomfortable and the biting insects would not let them sleep There were also abominable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricket There were thousands of them and they squeaked all round _neekbreek breekneek_ unceasingly all the night until the hobbits were nearly frantic The next day the fourth was little better and the night almost as comfortless Though the Neekerbreekers as Sam called them had been left behind the midges still pursued them As Frodo lay tired but unable to close his eyes it seemed to him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times It was not the dawn for that was still some hours off What is the light he said to Strider who had risen and was standing gazing ahead into the night I do not know Strider answered It is too distant to make out It is like lightning that leaps up from the hilltops Frodo lay down again but for a long while he could still see the white flashes and against them the tall dark figure of Strider standing silent and watchful At last he passed into uneasy sleep They had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last straggling pools and reedbeds of the marshes behind them The land before them began steadily to rise again Away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills The highest of them was at the right of the line and a little separated from the others It had a conical top slightly flattened at the summit That is Weathertop said Strider The Old Road which we have left far away on our right runs to the south of it and passes not far from its foot We might reach it by noon tomorrow if we go straight towards it I suppose we had better do so What do you mean asked Frodo I mean when we do get there it is not certain what we shall find It is close to the Road But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there Yes but the hope is faint If he comes this way at all he may not pass through Bree and so he may not know what we are doing And anyway unless by luck we arrive almost together we shall miss one another it will not be safe for him or for us to wait there long If the Riders fail to find us in the wilderness they are likely to make for Weathertop themselves It commands a wide view all round Indeed there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us as we stand here from that hilltop Not all the birds are to be trusted and there are other spies more evil than they are The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills Sam looked up into the pale sky fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes You do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome Strider he said What do you advise us to do asked Frodo I think answered Strider slowly as if he was not quite sure I think the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can to make for the line of hills not for Weathertop There we can strike a path I know that runs at their feet it will bring us to Weathertop from the north and less openly Then we shall see what we shall see All that day they plodded along until the cold and early evening came down The land became drier and more barren but mists and vapours lay behind them on the marshes A few melancholy birds were piping and wailing until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows then an empty silence fell The hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful windows of Bag End far away At the days end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland and they went up along its banks while the light lasted It was already night when at last they halted and made their camp under some stunted aldertrees by the shores of the stream Ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless backs of the hills That night they set a watch and Strider it seemed did not sleep at all The moon was waxing and in the early nighthours a cold grey light lay on the land Next morning they set out again soon after sunrise There was a frost in the air and the sky was a pale clear blue The hobbits felt refreshed as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep Already they were getting used to much walking on short commons shorter at any rate than what in the Shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs Pippin declared that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been Very odd said Frodo tightening his belt considering that there is actually a good deal less of me I hope the thinning process will not go on indefinitely or I shall become a wraith Do not speak of such things said Strider quickly and with surprising earnestness The hills drew nearer They made an undulating ridge often rising almost to a thousand feet and here and there falling again to low clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond Along the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of greengrown walls and dikes and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone By night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes and there they camped It was the night of the fifth of October and they were six days out from Bree In the morning they found for the first time since they had left the Chetwood a track plain to see They turned right and followed it southwards It ran cunningly taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep as much hidden as possible from the view both of the hilltops above and of the flats to the west It dived into dells and hugged steep banks and where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there were lines of large boulders and hewn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge I wonder who made this path and what for said Merry as they walked along one of these avenues where the stones were unusually large and closely set I am not sure that I like it it has a well rather a barrowwightish look Is there any barrow on Weathertop No There is no barrow on Weathertop nor on any of these hills answered Strider The Men of the West did not live here though in their latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came out of Angmar This path was made to serve the forts along the walls But long before in the first days of the North Kingdom they built a great watchtower on Weathertop Amon Sl they called it It was burned and broken and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hills head Yet once it was tall and fair It is told that Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gilgalad out of the West in the days of the Last Alliance The hobbits gazed at Strider It seemed that he was learned in old lore as well as in the ways of the wild Who was Gilgalad asked Merry but Strider did not answer and seemed to be lost in thought Suddenly a low voice murmured Gilgalad was an Elvenking Of him the harpers sadly sing the last whose realm was fair and free between the Mountains and the Sea His sword was long his lance was keen his shining helm afar was seen the countless stars of heavens field were mirrored in his silver shield But long ago he rode away and where he dwelleth none can say for into darkness fell his star in Mordor where the shadows are The others turned in amazement for the voice was Sams Dont stop said Merry Thats all I know stammered Sam blushing I learned it from Mr Bilbo when I was a lad He used to tell me tales like that knowing how I was always one for hearing about Elves It was Mr Bilbo as taught me my letters He was mighty booklearned was dear old Mr Bilbo And he wrote _poetry_ He wrote what I have just said He did not make it up said Strider It is pan of the lay that is called _The Fall of Gilgalad_ which is in an ancient tongue Bilbo must have translated it I never knew that There was a lot more said Sam all about Mordor I didnt learn that part it gave me the shivers I never thought I should be going that way myself Going to Mordor cried Pippin I hope it wont come to that Do not speak that name so loudly said Strider It was already midday when they drew near the southern end of the path and saw before them in the pale clear light of the October sun a greygreen bank leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill They decided to make for the top at once while the daylight was broad Concealment was no longer possible and they could only hope that no enemy or spy was observing them Nothing was to be seen moving on the hill If Gandalf was anywhere about there was no sign of him On the western flank of Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow at the bottom of which there was a bowlshaped dell with grassy sides There they left Sam and Pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage The other three went on After half an hours plodding climb Strider reached the crown of the hill Frodo and Merry followed tired and breathless The last slope had been steep and rocky On the top they found as Strider had said a wide ring of ancient stonework now crumbling or covered with agelong grass But in the centre a cairn of broken stones had been piled They were blackened as if with fire About them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled as if flames had swept the hilltop but there was no sign of any living thing Standing upon the rim of the ruined circle they saw all round below them a wide prospect for the most pan of lands empty and featureless except for patches of woodland away to the south beyond which they caught here and there the glint of distant water Beneath them on this southern side there ran like a ribbon the Old Road coming out of the West and winding up and down until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east Nothing was moving on it Following its line eastward with their eyes they saw the Mountains the nearer foothills were brown and sombre behind them stood taller shapes of grey and behind those again were high white peaks glimmering among the clouds Well here we are said Merry And very cheerless and uninviting it looks There is no water and no shelter And no sign of Gandalf But I dont blame him for not waiting if he ever came here I wonder said Strider looking round thoughtfully Even if he was a day or two behind us at Bree he could have arrived here first He can ride very swiftly when need presses Suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on the top of the cairn it was flatter than the others and whiter as if it had escaped the fire He picked it up and examined it turning it in his fingers This has been handled recently he said What do you think of these marks On the flat underside Frodo saw some scratches There seems to he a stroke a dot and three more strokes he said The stroke on the left might be a Grune with thin branches said Strider It might be a sign left by Gandalf though one cannot be sure The scratches are fine and they certainly look fresh But the marks might mean something quite different and have nothing to do with us Rangers use runes and they come here sometimes What could they mean even if Gandalf made them asked Merry I should say answered Strider that they stood for G3 and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the third that is three days ago now It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer If that is so we must be wary I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks whatever they may mean said Frodo It would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way in front of us or behind us Perhaps said Strider For myself I believe that he was here and was in danger There have been scorching flames here and now the light that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind I guess that he was attacked on this hilltop but with what result I cannot tell He is here no longer and we must now look after ourselves and make our own way to Rivendell as best we can How far is Rivendell asked Merry gazing round wearily The world looked wild and wide from Weathertop I dont know if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the _Forsaken Inn_ a days journey east of Bree answered Strider Some say it is so far and some say otherwise It is a strange road and folk are glad to reach their journeys end whether the time is long or short But I know how long it would take me on my own feet with fair weather and no ill fortune twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen where the Road crosses the Loudwater that runs out of Rivendell We have at least a fortnights journey before us for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road A fortnight said Frodo A lot may happen in that time It may said Strider They stood for a while silent on the hilltop near its southward edge In that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully realized his homelessness and danger He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in the quiet and beloved Shire He stared down at the hateful Road leading back westward to his home Suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving slowly along it going westward and looking again he saw that three others were creeping eastward to meet them He gave a cry and clutched Striders arm Look he said pointing downwards At once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle pulling Frodo down beside him Merry threw himself alongside What is it he whispered I do not know but I fear the worst answered Strider Slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again and peered through a cleft between two jagged stones The light was no longer bright for the clear morning had faded and clouds creeping out of the East had now overtaken the sun as it began to go down They could all see the black specks but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain yet something told them that there far below were Black Riders assembling on the Road beyond the foot of the hill Yes said Strider whose keener sight left him in no doubt The enemy is here Hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find their companions Sam and Peregrin had not been idle They had explored the small dell and the surrounding slopes Not far away they found a spring of clear water in the hillside and near it footprints not more than a day or two old In the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire and other signs of a hasty camp There were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to the hill Behind them Sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked I wonder if old Gandalf has been here he said to Pippin Whoever it was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems Strider was greatly interested in these discoveries I wish I had waited and explored the ground down here myself he said hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprints It is just as I feared he said when he came back Sam and Pippin have trampled the soft ground and the marks are spoilt or confused Rangers have been here lately It is they who left the firewood behind But there are also several newer tracks that were not made by Rangers At least one set was made only a day or two ago by heavy boots At least one I cannot now be certain but I think there were many booted feet He paused and stood in anxious thought Each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted Riders If the horsemen had already found the dell the sooner Strider led them somewhere else the better Sam viewed the hollow with great dislike now that he had heard news of their enemies on the Road only a few miles away Hadnt we better clear out quick Mr Strider he asked impatiently It is getting late and I dont like this hole it makes my heart sink somehow Yes we certainly must decide what to do at once answered Strider looking up and considering the time and the weather Well Sam he said at last I do not like this place either but I cannot think of anywhere better that we could reach before nightfall At least we are out of sight for the moment and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by spies All we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills where the land is all much the same as it is here The Road is watched but we should have to cross it if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south On the north side of the Road beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles Can the Riders _see_ asked Merry I mean they seem usually to have used their noses rather than their eyes smelling for us if smelling is the right word at least in the daylight But you made us lie down flat when you saw them down below and now you talk of being seen if we move I was too careless on the hilltop answered Strider I was very anxious to find some sign of Gandalf but it was a mistake for three of us to go up and stand there so long For the black horses can see and the Riders can use men and other creatures as spies as we found at Bree They themselves do not see the world of light as we do but our shapes cast shadows in their minds which only the noon sun destroys and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us then they are most to be feared And at all times they smell the blood of living things desiring and hating it Senses too there are other than sight or smell We can feel their presence it troubled our hearts as soon as we came here and before we saw them they feel ours more keenly Also he added and his voice sank to a whisper the Ring draws them Is there no escape then said Frodo looking round wildly If I move I shall be seen and hunted If I stay I shall draw them to me Strider laid his hand on his shoulder There is still hope he said You are not alone Let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as a sign There is little shelter or defence here but fire shall serve for both Sauron can put fire to his evil uses as he can all things but these Riders do not love it and fear those who wield it Fire is our friend in the wilderness Maybe muttered Sam It is also as good a way of saying here we are as I can think of bar shouting Down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a fire and prepared a meal The shades of evening began to fall and it grew cold They were suddenly aware of great hunger for they had not eaten anything since breakfast but they dared not make more than a frugal supper The lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts unfriendly places deserted by all the races of the world Rangers passed at times beyond the hills but they were few and did not stay Other wanderers were rare and of evil sort trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the Misty Mountains Only on the Road would travellers be found most often dwarves hurrying along on business of their own and with no help and few words to spare for strangers I dont see how our food can be made to last said Frodo We have been careful enough in the last few days and this supper is no feast but we have used more than we ought if we have two weeks still to go and perhaps more There is food in the wild said Strider berry root and herb and I have some skill as a hunter at need You need not be afraid of starving before winter comes But gathering and catching food is long and weary work and we need haste So tighten your belts and think with hope of the tables of Elronds house The cold increased as darkness came on Peering out from the edge of the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow The sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars Frodo and his companions huddled round the fire wrapped in every garment and blanket they possessed but Strider was content with a single cloak and sat a little apart drawing thoughtfully at his pipe As night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he began to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear He knew many histories and legends of long ago of Elves and Men and the good and evil deeds of the Elder Days They wondered how old he was and where he had learned all this lore Tell us of Gilgalad said Merry suddenly when he paused at the end of a story of the ElfKingdoms Do you know any more of that old lay that you spoke of I do indeed answered Strider So also does Frodo for it concerns us closely Merry and Pippin looked at Frodo who was staring into the fire I know only the little that Gandalf has told me said Frodo slowly Gilgalad was the last of the great Elfkings of Middleearth Gilgalad is _Starlight_ in their tongue With Elendil the Elffriend he went to the land of No said Strider interrupting I do not think that tale should be told now with the servants of the Enemy at hand If we win through to the house of Elrond you may hear it there told in full Then tell us some other tale of the old days begged Sam a tale about the Elves before the fading time I would dearly like to hear more about Elves the dark seems to press round so close I will tell you the tale of Tinviel said Strider in brief for it is a long tale of which the end is not known and there are none now except Elrond that remember it aright as it was told of old It is a fair tale though it is sad as are all the tales of Middleearth and yet it may lift up your hearts He was silent for some time and then he began not to speak but to chant softly The leaves were long the grass was green The hemlockumbels tall and fair And in the glade a light was seen Of stars in shadow shimmering Tinviel was dancing there To music of a pipe unseen And light of stars was in her hair And in her raiment glimmering There Beren came from mountains cold And lost he wandered under leaves And where the Elvenriver rolled He walked alone and sorrowing He peered between the hemlockleaves And saw in wander flowers of gold Upon her mantle and her sleeves And her hair like shadow following Enchantment healed his weary feet That over hills were doomed to roam And forth he hastened strong and fleet And grasped at moonbeams glistening Through woven woods in Elvenhome She tightly fled on dancing feet And left him lonely still to roam In the silent forest listening He heard there oft the flying sound Of feet as light as lindenleaves Or music welling underground In hidden hollows quavering Now withered lay the hemlocksheaves And one by one with sighing sound Whispering fell the beechen leaves In the wintry woodland wavering He sought her ever wandering far Where leaves of years were thickly strewn By light of moon and ray of star In frosty heavens shivering Her mantle glinted in the moon As on a hilltop high and far She danced and at her feet was strewn A mist of silver quivering When winter passed she came again And her song released the sudden spring Like rising lark and falling rain And melting water bubbling He saw the elvenflowers spring About her feet and healed again He longed by her to dance and sing Upon the grass untroubling Again she fled but swift he came Tinviel Tinviel He called her by her elvish name And there she halted listening One moment stood she and a spell His voice laid on her Beren came And doom fell on Tinviel That in his arms lay glistening As Beren looked into her eyes Within the shadows of her hair The trembling starlight of the skies He saw there mirrored shimmering Tinviel the elvenfair Immortal maiden elvenwise About him cast her shadowy hair And arms like silver glimmering Long was the way that fate them bore Oer stony mountains cold and grey Through halls of iron and darkling door And woods of nightshade morrowless The Sundering Seas between them lay And yet at last they met once more And long ago they passed away In the forest singing sorrowless Strider sighed and paused before he spoke again That is a song he said in the mode that is called _annthennath_ among the Elves but is hard to render in our Common Speech and this is but a rough echo of it It tells of the meeting of Beren son of Barahir and Lthien Tinviel Beren was a mortal man but Lthien was the daughter of Thingol a King of Elves upon Middleearth when the world was young and she was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all the children of this world As the stars above the mists of the Northern lands was her loveliness and in her face was a shining light In those days the Great Enemy of whom Sauron of Mordor was but a servant dwelt in Angband in the North and the Elves of the West coming back to Middleearth made war upon him to regain the Silmarils which he had stolen and the fathers of Men aided the Elves But the Enemy was victorious and Barahir was slain and Beren escaping through great peril came over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in the forest of Neldoreth There he beheld Lthien singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted river Esgalduin and he named her Tinviel that is Nightingale in the language of old Many sorrows befell them afterwards and they were parted long Tinviel rescued Beren from the dungeons of Sauron and together they passed through great dangers and cast down even the Great Enemy from his throne and took from his iron crown one of the three Silmarils brightest of all jewels to be the brideprice of Lthien to Thingol her father Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came from the gates of Angband and he died in the arms of Tinviel But she chose mortality and to die from the world so that she might follow him and it is sung that they met again beyond the Sundering Seas and after a brief time walking alive once more in the green woods together they passed long ago beyond the confines of this world So it is that Lthien Tinviel alone of the Elfkindred has died indeed and left the world and they have lost her whom they most loved But from her the lineage of the Elflords of old descended among Men There live still those of whom Lthien was the foremother and it is said that her line shall never fail Elrond of Rivendell is of that Kin For of Beren and Lthien was born Dior Thingols heir and of him Elwing the White whom Erendil wedded he that sailed his ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril upon his brow And of Erendil came the Kings of Nmenor that is Westernesse As Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face dimly lit in the red glow of the woodfire His eyes shone and his voice was rich and deep Above him was a black starry sky Suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of Weathertop behind him The waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed them and the stars above the hilltop faded The story ended The hobbits moved and stretched Look said Merry The Moon is rising it must be getting late The others looked up Even as they did so they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise It was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light Sam and Merry got up and walked away from the fire Frodo and Pippin remained seated in silence Strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently All seemed quiet and still but Frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart now that Strider was no longer speaking He huddled closer to the fire At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell I dont know what it is he said but I suddenly felt afraid I durstnt go outside this dell for any money I felt that something was creeping up the slope Did you _see_ anything asked Frodo springing to his feet No sir I saw nothing but I didnt stop to look I saw something said Merry or I thought I did away westwards where the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the hilltops I _thought_ there were two or three black shapes They seemed to be moving this way Keep close to the fire with your faces outward cried Strider Get some of the longer sticks ready in your hands For a breathless time they sat there silent and alert with their backs turned to the woodfire each gazing into the shadows that encircled them Nothing happened There was no sound or movement in the night Frodo stirred feeling that he must break the silence he longed to shout out aloud Hush whispered Strider Whats that gasped Pippin at the same moment Over the lip of the little dell on the side away from the hill they felt rather than saw a shadow rise one shadow or more than one They strained their eyes and the shadows seemed to grow Soon there could be no doubt three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope looking down on them So black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill Then the shapes slowly advanced Terror overcame Pippin and Merry and they threw themselves flat on the ground Sam shrank to Frodos side Frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions he was quaking as if he was bitter cold but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring The desire to do this laid hold of him and he could think of nothing else He did not forget the Barrow nor the message of Gandalf but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings and he longed to yield Not with the hope of escape or of doing anything either good or bad he simply felt that he must take the Ring and put it on his finger He could not speak He felt Sam looking at him as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble but he could not turn towards him He shut his eyes and struggled for a while but resistance became unbearable and at last he slowly drew out the chain and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand Immediately though everything else remained as before dim and dark the shapes became terribly clear He was able to see beneath their black wrappings There were five tall figures two standing on the lip of the dell three advancing In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes under their mantles were long grey robes upon their grey hairs were helms of silver in their haggard hands were swords of steel Their eyes fell on him and pierced him as they rushed towards him Desperate he drew his own sword and it seemed to him that it flickered red as if it was a firebrand Two of the figures halted The third was taller than the others his hair was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown In one hand he held a long sword and in the other a knife both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground and he heard himself crying aloud O _Elbereth Gilthoniel_ At the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy A shrill cry rang out in the night and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder Even as he swooned he caught as through a swirling mist a glimpse of Strider leaping out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand With a last effort Frodo dropping his sword slipped the Ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it _Chapter 12_ Flight to the Ford When Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately He was lying by the fire which was now piled high and burning brightly His three companions were bending over him What has happened Where is the pale king he asked wildly They were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while nor did they understand his question At length he gathered from Sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them Suddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him and he fell He heard Frodos voice but it seemed to come from a great distance or from under the earth crying out strange words They saw nothing more until they stumbled over the body of Frodo lying as if dead face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him Strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire and then he disappeared That was now a good while ago Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider but while they were talking he returned appearing suddenly out of the shadows They started and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo but Strider knelt down swiftly at his side I am not a Black Rider Sam he said gently nor in league with them I have been trying to discover something of their movements but I have found nothing I cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand When he heard what Frodo had to tell he became full of concern and shook his head and sighed Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much water as they could in their small kettles and to bathe the wound with it Keep the fire going well and keep Frodo warm he said Then he got up and walked away and called Sam to him I think I understand things better now he said in a low voice There seem only to have been five of the enemy Why they were not all here I dont know but I dont think they expected to be resisted They have drawn off for the time being But not far I fear They will come again another night if we cannot escape They are only waiting because they think that their purpose is almost accomplished and that the Ring cannot fly much further I fear Sam that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their will We shall see Sam choked with tears Dont despair said Strider You must trust me now Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so He is not slain and I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect I will do all I can to help and heal him Guard him well while I am away He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness Frodo dozed though the pain of his wound was slowly growing and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side His friends watched over him warming him and bathing his wound The night passed slowly and wearily Dawn was growing in the sky and the dell was filling with grey light when Strider at last returned Look he cried and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness A foot above the lower hem there was a slash This was the stroke of Frodos sword he said The only hurt that it did to his enemy I fear for it is unharmed but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King More deadly to him was the name of Elbereth And more deadly to Frodo was this He stooped again and lifted up a long thin knife There was a cold gleam in it As Strider raised it they saw that near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off But even as he held it up in the growing light they gazed in astonishment for the blade seemed to melt and vanished like a smoke in the air leaving only the hilt in Striders hand Alas he cried It was this accursed knife that gave the wound Few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons But I will do what I can He sat down on the ground and taking the daggerhilt laid it on his knees and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue Then setting it aside he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch From the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant These leaves he said I have walked far to find for this plant does not grow in the bare hills but in the thickets away south of the Road I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves He crushed a leaf in his fingers and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance It is fortunate that I could find it for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West brought to Middleearth _Athelas_ they named it and it grows now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old and it is not known in the North except to some of those who wander in the Wild It has great virtues but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodos shoulder The fragrance of the steam was refreshing and those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared The herb had also some power over the wound for Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side but the life did not return to his arm and he could not raise or use his hand He bitterly regretted his foolishness and reproached himself for weakness of will for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies He wondered if he would remain maimed for life and how they would now manage to continue their journey He fell too weak to stand The others were discussing this very question They quickly decided to leave Weathertop as soon as possible I think now said Strider that the enemy has been watching this place for some days If Gandalf ever came here then he must have been forced to ride away and he will not return In any case we are in great peril here after dark since the attack of last night and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go As soon as the daylight was full they had some hurried food and packed It was impossible for Frodo to walk so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them and put Frodo on the pony In the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully it already seemed fatter and stronger and had begun to show an affection for its new masters especially for Sam Bill Fernys treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life They started off in a southerly direction This would mean crossing the Road but it was the quickest way to more wooded country And they needed fuel for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm especially at night while fire would be some protection for them all It was also his plan to shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road east beyond Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards They made their way slowly and cautiously round the southwestern slopes of the hill and came in a little while to the edge of the Road There was no sign of the Riders But even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering Trembling they sprang forward and made for the thickets that lay ahead The land before them sloped away southwards but it was wild and pathless bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in between The grass was scanty coarse and grey and the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling It was a cheerless land and their journey was slow and gloomy They spoke little as they trudged along Frodos heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down and their backs bowed under their burdens Even Strider seemed tired and heavyhearted Before the first days march was over Frodos pain began to grow again but he did not speak of it for a long time Four days passed without the ground or the scene changing much except that behind them Weathertop slowly sank and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer Yet since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed them They dreaded the dark hours and kept watch in pairs by night expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night dimly lit by the cloudveiled moon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass Not once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the dell It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost their trail again Perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow place At the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended Strider now turned their course again northeastwards and on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slowclimbing slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the feet of the hills and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine In the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley halfveiled in mist I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while said Strider We have now come to the River Hoarwell that the Elves call Mitheithel It flows down out of the Ettenmoors the trollfells north of Rivendell and joins the Loudwater away in the South Some call it the Greyflood after that It is a great water before it finds the Sea There is no way over it below its sources in the Ettenmoors except by the Last Bridge on which the Road crosses What is that other river we can see far away there asked Merry That is Loudwater the Bruinen of Rivendell answered Strider The Road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the Ford of Bruinen But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water One river at a time We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last Bridge held against us Next day early in the morning they came down again to the borders of the Road Sam and Strider went forward but they found no sign of any travellers or riders Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain Strider judged that it had fallen two days before and had washed away all footprints No horseman had passed since then as far as he could see They hurried along with all the speed they could make and after a mile or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead at the bottom of a short steep slope They dreaded to see black figures waiting there but they saw none Strider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road while he went forward to explore Before long he came hurrying back I can see no sign of the enemy he said and I wonder very much what that means But I have found something very strange He held out his hand and showed a single palegreen jewel I found it in the mud in the middle of the Bridge he said It is a beryl an elfstone Whether it was set there or let fall by chance I cannot say but it brings hope to me I will take it as a sign that we may pass the Bridge but beyond that I dare not keep to the Road without some clearer token At once they went on again They crossed the Bridge in safety hearing no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches A mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the Road Here Strider turned aside and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous Road behind them but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly As they went forward the hills about them steadily rose Here and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone and the ruins of towers they had an ominous look Frodo who was not walking had time to gaze ahead and to think He recalled Bilbos account of his journey and the threatening towers on the hills north of the Road in the country near the Trolls wood where his first serious adventure had happened Frodo guessed that they were now in the same region and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot Who lives in this land he asked And who built these towers Is this trollcountry No said Strider Trolls do not build No one lives in this land Men once dwelt here ages ago but none remain now They became an evil people as legends tell for they fell under the shadow of Angmar But all were destroyed in the war that brought the North Kingdom to its end But that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them though a shadow still lies on the land Where did you learn such tales if all the land is empty and forgetful asked Peregrin The birds and beasts do not tell tales of that son The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past said Strider and many more things than I can tell are remembered in Rivendell Have you often been to Rivendell said Frodo I have said Strider I dwelt there once and still I return when I may There my heart is but it is not my fate to sit in peace even in the fair house of Elrond The hills now began to shut them in The Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen but both were now hidden from view The travellers came into a long valley narrow deeply cloven dark and silent Trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pinewood The hobbits grew very weary They advanced slowly for they had to pick their way through a pathless country encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodos sake and because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales They had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet The wind began to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain By nightfall they were all soaked and their camp was cheerless for they could not get any fire to burn The next day the hills rose still higher and steeper before them and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their course Strider seemed to be getting anxious they were nearly ten days out from Weathertop and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low It went on raining That night they camped on a stony shelf with a rockwall behind them in which there was a shallow cave a mere scoop in the cliff Frodo was restless The cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep He lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy nightnoises wind in chinks of rock water dripping a crack the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone He felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up smoking his pipe and watching He lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the Shire but it seemed faint and dim less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge In the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped The clouds were still thick but they were breaking and pale strips of blue appeared between them The wind was shifting again They did not start early Immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast Strider went off alone telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff until he came back He was going to climb up if he could and get a look at the lie of the land When he returned he was not reassuring We have come too far to the north he said and we must find some way to turn back southwards again If we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north of Rivendell That is trollcountry and little known to me We could perhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north but it would take too long for I do not know the way and our food would not last So somehow or other we must find the Ford of Bruinen The rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground They found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running southeast the direction that they wished to take but towards the end of the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land its dark edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw They had a choice between going back or climbing over it They decided to attempt the climb but it proved very difficult Before long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot Even so they often despaired of getting their pony up or indeed of finding a path for themselves burdened as they were The light was nearly gone and they were all exhausted when at last they reached the top They had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two higher points and the land fell steeply away again only a short distance ahead Frodo threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering His left arm was lifeless and his side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them The trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim We cannot go any further said Merry to Strider I am afraid this has been too much for Frodo I am dreadfully anxious about him What are we to do Do you think they will be able to cure him in Rivendell if we ever get there We shall see answered Strider There is nothing more that I can do in the wilderness and it is chiefly because of his wound that I am so anxious to press on But I agree that we can go no further tonight What is the matter with my master asked Sam in a low voice looking appealingly at Strider His wound was small and it is already closed Theres nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy said Strider and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out But do not give up hope Sam Night was cold up on the high ridge They lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots of an old pine that hung over a shallow pit it looked as if stone had once been quarried there They sat huddled together The wind blew chill through the pass and they heard the treetops lower down moaning and sighing Frodo lay half in a dream imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping by above him and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills The morning dawned bright and fair the air was clean and the light pale and clear in a rainwashed sky Their hearts were encouraged but hey longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs As soon as it was light Strider took Merry with him and went to survey the country from the height to the east of the pass The sun had risen and was shining brightly when he returned with more comforting news They were now going more or less in the right direction If they went on down the further side of the ridge they would have the Mountains on their left Some way ahead Strider had caught a glimpse of the Loudwater again and he knew that though it was hidden from view the Road to the Ford was not far from the River and lay on the side nearest to them We must make for the Road again he said We cannot hope to find a path through these hills Whatever danger may beset it the Road is our only way to the Ford As soon as they had eaten they set out again They climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge but the way was much easier than they had expected for the slope was far less steep on this side and before long Frodo was able to ride again Bill Fernys poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path and for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible The spirits of the party rose again Even Frodo felt better in the morning light but every now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight and he passed his hands over his eyes Pippin was a little ahead of the others Suddenly he turned round and called to them There is a path here he cried When they came up with him they saw that he had made no mistake there were clearly the beginnings of a path that climbed with many windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hilltop behind In places it was now faint and overgrown or choked with fallen stones and trees but at one time it seemed to have been much used It was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet Here and there old trees had been cut or broken down and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way They followed the track for some while for it offered much the easiest way down but they went cautiously and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods and the path grew plainer and broader Suddenly coming out of a belt of firtrees it ran steeply down a slope and turned sharply to the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill When they came to the comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees In the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge Outside the door they all halted There was a cave or rockchamber behind but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen Strider Sam and Merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little wider and then Strider and Merry went in They did not go far for on the floor lay many old bones and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots Surely this is a trollhole if ever there was one said Pippin Come out you two and let us get away Now we know who made the path and we had better get off it quick There is no need I think said Strider coining out It is certainly a trollhole but it seems to have been long forsaken I dont think we need be afraid But let us go on down warily and we shall see The path went on again from the door and turning to the right again across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope Pippin not liking to show Strider that he was still afraid went on ahead with Merry Sam and Strider came behind one on each side of Frodos pony for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast But they had not gone very far before Pippin came running back followed by Merry They both looked terrified There _are_ trolls Pippin panted Down in a clearing in the woods not far below We got a sight of them through the treetrunks They are very large We will come and look at them said Strider picking up a stick Frodo said nothing but Sam looked scared The sun was now high and it shone down through the halfstripped branches of the trees and lit the clearing with bright patches of light They halted suddenly on the edge and peered through the treetrunks holding their breath There stood the trolls three large trolls One was stooping and the other two stood staring at him Strider walked forward unconcernedly Get up old stone he said and broke his stick upon the stooping troll Nothing happened There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits and then even Frodo laughed Well he said We are forgetting our family history These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit I had no idea we were anywhere near the place said Pippin He knew the story well Bilbo and Frodo had told it often but as a matter of fact he had never more than half believed it Even now he looked at the stone trolls with suspicion wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life again You are forgetting not only your family history but all you ever knew about trolls said Strider It is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in this glade In any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old birds nest behind his ear That would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll They all laughed Frodo felt his spirits reviving the reminder of Bilbos first successful adventure was heartening The sun too was warm and comforting and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little They rested for some time in the glade and took their midday meal right under the shadow of the trolls large legs Wont somebody give us a bit of a song while the sun is high said Merry when they had finished We havent had a song or a tale for days Not since Weathertop said Frodo The others looked at him Dont worry about me he added I feel much better but I dont think I could sing Perhaps Sam could dig something out of his memory Come on Sam said Merry Theres more stored in your head than you let on about I dont know about that said Sam But how would this suit It aint what I call proper poetry if you understand me just a bit of nonsense But these old images here brought it to my mind Standing up with his hands behind his back as if he was at school he began to sing to an old tune Troll sat alone on his seat of stone And munched and mumbled a bare old bone For many a year he had gnawed it near For meat was hard to come by Done by Gum by In a case in the hills he dwelt alone And meat was hard to come by Up came Tom with his big boots on Said he to Troll Pray what is yon For it looks like the shin o my nuncle Tim As should be alyin in graveyard Caveyard Paveyard This many a year has Tim been gone And I thought he were lyin in graveyard My lad said Troll this bone I stole But what be bones that lie in a hole Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o lead Afore I found his shinbone Tinbone Thinbone He can spare a share for a poor old troll For he dont need his shinbone Said Tom I dont see why the likes o thee Without axin leave should go makin free With the shank or the shin o my fathers kin So hand the old bone over Rover Trover Though dead he be it belongs to he So hand the old bone over For a couple o pins says Troll and grins Ill eat thee too and gnaw thy shins A bit o fresh meal will go down sweet Ill try my teeth on thee now Hee now See now Im tired o gnawing old bones and skins Ive a mind to dine on thee now But just as he thought his dinner was caught He found his hands had hold of naught Before he could mind Tom slipped behind And gave him the boot to larn him Warn him Darn him A bump o the boot on the seat Tom thought Would be the way to larn him But harder than stone is the flesh and bone Of a troll that sits in the hills alone As well set your boot to the mountains root For the seat of a troll dont feel it Peel it Heal it Old Troll laughed when he heard Tom groan And he knew his toes could feel it Toms leg is game since home he came And his bootless foot is lasting lame But Troll dont care and hes still there With the bone he boned from its owner Doner Boner Trolls old seat is still the same And the bone he boned from its owner Well thats a warning to us all laughed Merry It is as well you used a stick and not your hand Strider Where did you come by that Sam asked Pippin Ive never heard those words before Sam muttered something inaudible Its out of his own head of course said Frodo I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey First he was a conspirator now hes a jester Hell end up by becoming a wizard or a warrior I hope not said Sam I dont want to be neither In the afternoon they went on down the woods They were probably following the very track that Gandalf Bilbo and the dwarves had used many years before After a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank above the Road At this point the Road had left the Hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley and now clung close to the feet of the hills rolling and winding eastward among woods and heathercovered slopes towards the Ford and the Mountains Not far down the bank Strider pointed out a stone in the grass On it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen dwarfrunes and secret marks There said Merry That must be the stone that marked the place where the trolls gold was hidden How much is left of Bilbos share I wonder Frodo Frodo looked at the stone and wished that Bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilous nor less easy to pan with None at all he said Bilbo gave it all away He told me he did not feel it was really his as it came from robbers The Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening There was no sign of any other travellers to be seen As there was now no other possible course for them to take they climbed down the bank and turning left went off as fast as they could Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast westering sun A cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead They were beginning to look out for a place off the Road where they could camp for the night when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into their hearts the noise of hoofs behind them They looked back but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the Road As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above until they came to a small patch of thickgrowing hazels As they peered out from among the bushes they could see the Road faint and grey in the failing light some thirty feel below them The sound of hoofs drew nearer They were going fast with a light _clippetyclippelyclip_ Then faintly as if it was blown away from them by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringing as of small bells tinkling That does not sound like a Black Riders horse said Frodo listening intently The other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but they all remained full of suspicion They had been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly But Strider was now leaning forward stooped to the ground with a hand to his ear and a look of joy on his face The light faded and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly Clearer and nearer now the bells jingled and _clippetyclip_ came the quick trotting feet Suddenly into view below came a white horse gleaming in the shadows running swiftly In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed as if it were studded with gems like living stars The riders cloak streamed behind him and his hood was thrown back his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed To Frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider as if through a thin veil Strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road leaping with a cry through the heather but even before he had moved or called the rider had reined in his horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood When he saw Strider he dismounted and ran to meet him calling out _Ai na vedui Dnadan Mae govannen_ His speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their hearts the rider was of the Elvenfolk No others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear But there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call and they saw that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider Soon Strider beckoned to them and the hobbits left the bushes and hurried down to the Road This is Glorfindel who dwells in the house of Elrond said Strider Hail and well met at last said the Elflord to Frodo I was sent from Rivendell to look for you We feared that you were in danger upon the road Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell cried Frodo joyfully No He had not when I departed but that was nine days ago answered Glorfindel Elrond received news that troubled him Some of my kindred journeying in your land beyond the Baranduin learned that things were amiss and sent messages as swiftly as they could They said that the Nine were abroad and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance for Gandalf had not returned There are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against the Nine but such as there were Elrond sent out north west and south It was thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit and become lost in the Wilderness It was my lot to take the Road and I came to the Bridge of Mitheithel and left a token there nigh on seven days ago Three of the servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge but they withdrew and I pursued them westward I came also upon two others but they turned away southward Since then I have searched for your trail Two days ago I found it and followed it over the Bridge and today I marked where you descended from the hills again But come There is no time for further news Since you are here we must risk the peril of the Road and go There are five behind us and when they find your trail upon the Road they will ride after us like the wind And they are not all Where the other four may be I do not know I fear that we may find the Ford is already held against us While Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened Frodo felt a great weariness come over him Ever since the sun began to sink the mist before his eyes had darkened and he felt that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his friends Now pain assailed him and he felt cold He swayed clutching at Sams arm My master is sick and wounded said Sam angrily He cant go on riding after nightfall He needs rest Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground and taking him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety Briefly Strider told of the attack on their camp under Weathertop and of the deadly knife He drew out the hilt which he had kept and handed it to the Elf Glorfindel shuddered as he took it but he looked intently at it There are evil things written on this hilt he said though maybe your eyes cannot see them Keep it Aragorn till we reach the house of Elrond But be wary and handle it as little as you may Alas the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal I will do what I can but all the more do I urge you now to go on without rest He searched the wound on Frodos shoulder with his fingers and his face grew graver as if what he learned disquieted him But Frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand and the pain grew easier The dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him as if a cloud had been withdrawn He saw his friends faces more clearly again and a measure of new hope and strength returned You shall ride my horse said Glorfindel I will shorten the stirrups up to the saddleskins and you must sit as tight as you can But you need not fear my horse will not let any rider fall that I command him to bear His pace is light and smooth and if danger presses too near he will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rival No he will not said Frodo I shall not ride him if I am to be carried off to Rivendell or anywhere else leaving my friends behind in danger Glorfindel smiled I doubt very much he said if your friends would be in danger if you were not with them The pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace I think It is you Frodo and that which you bear that brings us all in peril To that Frodo had no answer and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindels white horse The pony was laden instead with a great part of the others burdens so that they now marched lighter and for a time made good speed but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless feet of the Elf On he led them into the mouth of darkness and still on under the deep clouded night There was neither star nor moon Not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt Pippin Merry and Sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs and even Strider seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be weary Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream They cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the roadside and fell asleep immediately They seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when Glorfindel who had set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again The sun had now climbed far into the morning and the clouds and mists of the night were gone Drink this said Glorfindel to them pouring for each in turn a little liquor from his silverstudded flask of leather It was clear as spring water and had no taste and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank it Eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit which was now all that they had left seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done They had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the Road again Glorfindel still urged them on and only allowed two brief halts during the days march In this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall and came to a point where the Road bent right and ran down towards the bottom of the valley now making straight for the Bruinen So far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear but often Glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment if they lagged behind and a look of anxiety clouded his face Once or twice he spoke to Strider in the elftongue But however anxious their guides might be it was plain that the hobbits could go no further that night They were stumbling along dizzy with weariness and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs Frodos pain had redoubled and during the day things about him faded to shadows of ghostly grey He almost welcomed the coming of night for then the world seemed less pale and empty The hobbits were still weary when they set out again early next morning There were many miles yet to go between them and the Ford and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river said Glorfindel for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us and other danger may be waiting by the Ford The Road was still running steadily downhill and there was now in places much grass at either side in which the hobbits walked when they could to ease their tired feet In the late afternoon they came to a place where the Road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pinetrees and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone Echoes ran along as they hurried forward and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their own All at once as if through a gate of light the Road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open There at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile and beyond that the Ford of Rivendell On the further side was a steep brown bank threaded by a winding path and behind that the tall mountains climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond peak into the fading sky There was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind them a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pines One moment Glorfindel turned and listened then he sprang forward with a loud cry Fly he called Fly The enemy is upon us The white horse leaped forward The hobbits ran down the slope Glorfindel and Strider followed as rearguard They were only half way across the flat when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping Out of the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider He reined his horse in and halted swaying in his saddle Another followed him and then another then again two more Ride forward Ride cried Glorfindel to Frodo He did not obey at once for a strange reluctance seized him Checking the horse to a walk he turned and looked back The Riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill dark and solid while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist Suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to wait Then at once fear and hatred awoke in him His hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword and with a red flash he drew it Ride on Ride on cried Glorfindel and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the elftongue _noro lim noro lim Asfaloth_ At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the Road At the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit and from the Riders came a terrible cry such as Frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfarthing far away It was answered and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away on the left four other Riders came flying Two rode towards Frodo two galloped madly towards the Ford to cut off his escape They seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker as their courses converged with his Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder He could no longer see his friends The Riders behind were falling back even their great steeds were no match in speed for the white elfhorse of Glorfindel He looked forward again and hope faded There seemed no chance of reaching the Ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush He could see them clearly now they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black cloaks and they were robed in white and grey Swords were naked in their pale hands helms were on their heads Their cold eyes glittered and they called to him with fell voices Fear now filled all Frodos mind He thought no longer of his sword No cry came from him He shut his eyes and clung to the horses mane The wind whistled in his ears and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill A breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear as with a last spurt like a flash of white fire the elfhorse speeding as if on wings passed right before the face of the foremost Rider Frodo heard the splash of water It foamed about his feet He felt the quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony path He was climbing the steep bank He was across the Ford But the pursuers were close behind At the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercely There were Nine Riders at the waters edge below and Frodos spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces He knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had done and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell if once the Riders crossed In any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt Hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the strength to refuse Suddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward It checked at the water and reared up With a great effort Frodo sat upright and brandished his sword Go back he cried Go back to the Land of Mordor and follow me no more His voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears The Riders halted but Frodo had not the power of Bombadil His enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter Come back Come back they called To Mordor we will take you Go back he whispered The Ring The Ring they cried with deadly voices and immediately their leader urged his horse forward into the water followed closely by two others By Elbereth and Lthien the Fair said Frodo with a last effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither the Ring nor me Then the leader who was now half across the Ford stood up menacing in his stirrups and raised up his hand Frodo was stricken dumb He felt his tongue cleave to his mouth and his heart labouring His sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand The elfhorse reared and snorted The foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore At that moment there came a roaring and a rushing a noise of loud waters rolling many stones Dimly Frodo saw the river below him rise and down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves White flames seemed to Frodo to flicker on their crests and he half fancied that he saw amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes The three Riders that were still in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed they disappeared buried suddenly under angry foam Those that were behind drew back in dismay With his last failing senses Frodo heard cries and it seemed to him that he saw beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore a shining figure of white light and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames that flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world The black horses were filled with madness and leaping forward in terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood Their piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away Then Frodo felt himself falling and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf him together with his enemies He heard and saw no more _Chapter 1_ Many Meetings Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed At first he thought that he had slept late after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory Or perhaps he had been ill But the ceiling looked strange it was flat and it had dark beams richly carved He lay a little while longer looking at patches of sunlight on the wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall Where am I and what is the time he said aloud to the ceiling In the House of Elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning said a voice It is the morning of October the twentyfourth if you want to know Gandalf cried Frodo sitting up There was the old wizard sitting in a chair by the open window Yes he said I am here And you are lucky to be here too after all the absurd things you have done since you left home Frodo lay down again He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue and in any case he did not think he would get the better of an argument He was fully awake now and the memory of his journey was returning the disastrous short cut through the Old Forest the accident at _The Prancing Pony_ and his madness in putting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop While he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in Rivendell there was a long silence broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalfs pipe as he blew white smokerings out of the window Wheres Sam Frodo asked at length And are the others all right Yes they are all safe and sound answered Gandalf Sam was here until I sent him off to get some rest about half an hour ago What happened at the Ford said Frodo It all seemed so dim somehow and it still does Yes it would You were beginning to fade answered Gandalf The wound was overcoming you at last A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid But you have some strength in you my dear hobbit As you showed in the Barrow That was touch and go perhaps the most dangerous moment of all I wish you could have held out at Weathertop You seem to know a great deal already said Frodo I have not spoken to the others about the Barrow At first it was too horrible and afterwards there were other things to think about How do you know about it You have talked long in your sleep Frodo said Gandalf gently and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory Do not worry Though I said absurd just now I did not mean it I think well of youand of the others It is no small feat to have come so far and through such dangers still bearing the Ring We should never have done it without Strider said Frodo But we needed you I did not know what to do without you I was delayed said Gandalf and that nearly proved our ruin And yet I am not sure it may have been better so I wish you would tell me what happened All in good time You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything today by Elronds orders But talking would stop me thinking and wondering which are quite as tiring said Frodo I am wide awake now and I remember so many things that want explaining Why were you delayed You ought to tell me that at least You will soon hear all you wish to know said Gandalf We shall have a Council as soon as you are well enough At the moment I will only say that I was held captive You cried Frodo Yes I Gandalf the Grey said the wizard solemnly There are many powers in the world for good or for evil Some are greater than I am Against some I have not yet been measured But my time is coming The Morgullord and his Black Riders have come forth War is preparing Then you knew of the Riders alreadybefore I met them Yes I knew of them Indeed I spoke of them once to you for the Black Riders are the Ringwraiths the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings But I did not know that they had arisen again or I should have fled with you at once I heard news of them only after I left you in June but that story must wait For the moment we have been saved from disaster by Aragorn Yes said Frodo it was Strider that saved us Yet I was afraid of him at first Sam never quite trusted him I think not at any rate until we met Glorfindel Gandalf smiled I have heard all about Sam he said He has no more doubts now I am glad said Frodo For I have become very fond of Strider Well _fond_ is not the right word I mean he is dear to me though he is strange and grim at times In fact he reminds me often of you I didnt know that any of the Big People were like that I thought well that they were just big and rather stupid kind and stupid like Butterbur or stupid and wicked like Bill Ferny But then we dont know much about Men in the Shire except perhaps the Breelanders You dont know much even about them if you think old Barliman is stupid said Gandalf He is wise enough on his own ground He thinks less than he talks and slower yet he can see through a brick wall in time as they say in Bree But there are few left in Middleearth like Aragorn son of Arathorn The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end It may be that this War of the Ring will be their last adventure Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the old Kings said Frodo in wonder I thought they had all vanished long ago I thought he was only a Ranger Only a Ranger cried Gandalf My dear Frodo that is just what the Rangers are the last remnant in the North of the great people the Men of the West They have helped me before and I shall need their help in the days to come for we have reached Rivendell but the Ring is not yet at rest I suppose not said Frodo But so far my only thought has been to get here and I hope I shant have to go any further It is very pleasant just to rest I have had a month of exile and adventure and I find that has been as much as I want He fell silent and shut his eyes After a while he spoke again I have been reckoning he said and I cant bring the total up to October the twentyfourth It ought to be the twentyfirst We must have reached the Ford by the twentieth You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you said Gandalf How do the side and shoulder feel now I dont know Frodo answered They dont feel at all which is an improvement buthe made an effortI can move my arm again a little Yes it is coming back to life It is not cold he added touching his left hand with his right Good said Gandalf It is mending fast You will soon be sound again Elrond has cured you he has tended you for days ever since you were brought in Days said Frodo Well four nights and three days to be exact The Elves brought you from this where you lost count We have been terribly anxious and Sam has hardly left your side day or night except to run messages Elrond is a master of healing but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly To tell you the truth I had very little hope for I suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the closed wound But it could not be found until last night Then Elrond removed a splinter It was deeply buried and it was working inwards Frodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that had vanished in Striders hands Dont be alarmed said Gandalf It is gone now It has been melted And it seems that Hobbits fade very reluctantly I have known strong warriors of the Big People who would quickly have been overcome by that splinter which you bore for seventeen days What would they have done to me asked Frodo What were the Riders trying to do They tried to pierce your heart with a Morgulknife which remains in the wound If they had succeeded you would have become like they are only weaker and under their command You would have became a wraith under the dominion of the Dark Lord and he would have tormented you for trying to keep his Ring if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand Thank goodness I did not realize the horrible danger said Frodo faintly I was mortally afraid of course but if I had known more I should not have dared even to move It is a marvel that I escaped Yes fortune or fate have helped you said Gandalf not to mention courage For your heart was not touched and only your shoulder was pierced and that was because you resisted to the last But it was a terribly narrow shave so to speak You were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring for then you were half in the wraithworld yourself and they might have seized you You could see them and they could see you I know said Frodo They were terrible to behold But why could we all see their horses Because they are real horses just as the black robes are real robes that they wear to give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings with the living Then why do these black horses endure such riders All other animals are terrified when they draw near even the elfhorse of Glorfindel The dogs howl and the geese scream at them Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord in Mordor Not all his servants and chattels are wraiths There are orcs and trolls there are wargs and werewolves and there have been and still are many Men warriors and kings that walk alive under the Sun and yet are under his sway And their number is growing daily What about Rivendell and the Elves Is Rivendell safe Yes at present until all else is conquered The Elves may fear the Dark Lord and they may fly before him but never again will they listen to him or serve him And here in Rivendell there live still some of his chief foes the Elvenwise lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas They do not fear the Ringwraiths for those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm live at once in both worlds and against both the Seen and the Unseen they have great power I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the others Was that Glorfindel then Yes you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side one of the mighty of the Firstborn He is an Elflord of a house of princes Indeed there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor for a while and elsewhere other powers still dwell There is power too of another kind in the Shire But all such places will soon become islands under siege if things go on as they are going The Dark Lord is putting forth all his strength Still he said standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire we must keep up our courage You will soon be well if I do not talk you to death You are in Rivendell and you need not worry about anything for the present I havent any courage to keep up said Frodo but I am not worried at the moment Just give me news of my friends and tell me the end of the affair at the Ford as I keep on asking and I shall be content for the present After that I shall have another sleep I think but I shant be able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took a good look at Frodo The colour had come back to his face and his eyes were clear and fully awake and aware He was smiling and there seemed to be little wrong with him But to the wizards eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were of transparency about him and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet Still that must be expected said Gandalf to himself He is not half through yet and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can foretell Not to evil I think He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can You look splendid he said aloud I will risk a brief tale without consulting Elrond But quite brief mind you and then you must sleep again This is what happened as far as I can gather The Riders made straight for you as soon as you fled They did not need the guidance of their horses any longer you had become visible to them being already on the threshold of their world And also the Ring drew them Your friends sprang aside off the road or they would have been ridden down They knew that nothing could save you if the white horse could not The Riders were too swift to overtake and too many to oppose On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together could not with stand all the Nine at once When the Ringwraiths swept by your friends ran up behind Close to the Ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted trees There they hastily kindled fire for Glorfindel knew that a flood would come down if the Riders tried to cross and then he would have to deal with any that were left on his side of the river The moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by Aragorn and the others with flaming brands Caught between fire and water and seeing an Elflord revealed in his wrath they were dismayed and their horses were stricken with madness Three were carried away by the first assault of the flood the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed And is that the end of the Black Riders asked Frodo No said Gandalf Their horses must have perished and without them they are crippled But the Ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed However there is nothing more to fear from them at present Your friends crossed after the flood had passed and they found you lying on your face at the top of the bank with a broken sword under you The horse was standing guard beside you You were pale and cold and they feared that you were dead or worse Elronds folk met them carrying you slowly towards Rivendell Who made the flood asked Frodo Elrond commanded it answered Gandalf The river of this valley is under his power and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the Ford As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was released If I may say so I added a few touches of my own you may not have noticed but some of the waves took the form of great white horses with shining white riders and there were many rolling and grinding boulders For a moment I was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away There is great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the Misty Mountains Yes it all comes back to me now said Frodo the tremendous roaring I thought I was drowning with my friends and enemies and all But now we are safe Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo but he had shut his eyes Yes you are all safe for the present Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the victory at the Ford of Bruinen and you will all be there in places of honour Splendid said Frodo It is wonderful that Elrond and Glorfindel and such great lords not to mention Strider should take so much trouble and show me so much kindness Well there are many reasons why they should said Gandalf smiling I am one good reason The Ring is another you are the Ringbearer And you are the heir of Bilbo the Ringfinder Dear Bilbo said Frodo sleepily I wonder where he is I wish he was here and could hear all about it It would have made him laugh The cow jumped over the Moon And the poor old troll With that he fell fast asleep Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea That house was as Bilbo had long ago reported a perfect house whether you like food or sleep or storytelling or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a pleasant mixture of them all Merely to be there was a cure for weariness fear and sadness As the evening drew on Frodo woke up again and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest or sleep but had a mind for food and drink and probably for singing and storytelling afterwards He got out of bed and discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had been He found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently Looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered it looked remarkably like the young nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the Shire but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully Yes you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a lookingglass he said to his reflection But now for a merry meeting He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune At that moment there was a knock on the door and Sam came in He ran to Frodo and took his left hand awkwardly and shyly He stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away Hullo Sam said Frodo Its warm said Sam Meaning your hand Mr Frodo It has felt so cold through the long nights But glory and trumpets he cried turning round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor Its fine to see you up and yourself again sir Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down and I thought he was joking I am ready said Frodo Lets go and look for the rest of the party I can take you to them sir said Sam Its a big house this and very peculiar Always a bit more to discover and no knowing what youll find round a corner And Elves sir Elves here and Elves there Some like kings terrible and splendid and some as merry as children And the music and the singingnot that I have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got here But Im getting to know some of the ways of the place I know what you have been doing Sam said Frodo taking his arm But you shall be merry tonight and listen to your hearts content Come on guide me round the corners Sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high garden above the steep bank of the river He found his friends sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking east Shadows had fallen in the valley below but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far above The air was warm The sound of running and falling water was loud and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers as if summer still lingered in Elronds gardens Hurray cried Pippin springing up Here is our noble cousin Make way for Frodo Lord of the Ring Hush said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch Evil things do not come into this valley but all the same we should not name them The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo but the master of the Dark Tower of Mordor whose power is again stretching out over the world We are sitting in a fortress Outside it is getting dark Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that said Pippin He thinks I need keeping in order But it seems impossible somehow to feel gloomy or depressed in this place I feel I could sing if I knew the right song for the occasion I feel like singing myself laughed Frodo Though at the moment I feel more like eating and drinking That will soon be cured said Pippin You have shown your usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal More than meal A feast said Merry As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered the preparations began He had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells The hall of Elronds house was filled with folk Elves for the most part though there were a few guests of other sorts Elrond as was his custom sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel on the other side sat Gandalf Frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never before seen Elrond of whom so many tales spoke and as they sat upon his right hand and his left Glorfindel and even Gandalf whom he thought he knew so well were revealed as lords of dignity and power Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two but his long white hair his sweeping silver beard and his broad shoulders made him look like some wise king of ancient legend In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire Glorfindel was tall and straight his hair was of shining gold his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy his eyes were bright and keen and his voice like music on his brow sat wisdom and in his hand was strength The face of Elrond was ageless neither old nor young though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful His hair was dark as the shadows of twilight and upon it was set a circlet of silver his eyes were grey as a clear evening and in them was a light like the light of stars Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men In the middle of the table against the woven cloths upon the wall there was a chair under a canopy and there sat a lady fair to look upon and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred Young she was and yet not so The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth and the light of stars was in her bright eyes grey as a cloudless night yet queenly she looked and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of one who has known many things that the years bring Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems glittering white but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen Arwen daughter of Elrond in whom it was said that the likeness of Lthien had come on earth again and she was called Undmiel for she was the Evenstar of her people Long she had been in the land of her mothers kin in Lrien beyond the mountains and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her fathers house But her brothers Elladan and Elrohir were out upon errantry for they rode often far afield with the Rangers of the North forgetting never their mothers torment in the dens of the orcs Such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor imagined in his mind and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at Elronds table among all these folk so high and fair Though he had a suitable chair and was raised upon several cushions he felt very small and rather out of place but that feeling quickly passed The feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire It was some time before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours He looked first for his friends Sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his master but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honour Frodo could see him now sitting with Pippin and Merry at the upper end of one of the sidetables close to the dais He could see no sign of Strider Next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance richly dressed His beard very long and forked was white nearly as white as the snowwhite cloth of his garments He wore a silver belt and round his neck hung a chain of silver and diamonds Frodo stopped eating to look at him Welcome and well met said the dwarf turning towards him Then he actually rose from his seat and bowed Glin at your service he said and bowed still lower Frodo Baggins at your service and your familys said Frodo correctly rising in surprise and scattering his cushions Am I right in guessing that you are _the_ Glin one of the twelve companions of the great Thorin Oakenshield Quite right answered the dwarf gathering up the cushions and courteously assisting Frodo back into his seat And I do not ask for I have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our friend Bilbo the renowned Allow me to congratulate you on your recovery Thank you very much said Frodo You have had some very strange adventures I hear said Glin I wonder greatly what brings _four_ hobbits on so long a journey Nothing like it has happened since Bilbo came with us But perhaps I should not inquire too closely since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this I think we will not speak of it at least not yet said Frodo politely He guessed that even in Elronds house the matter of the Ring was not one for casual talk and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time But I am equally curious he added to learn what brings so important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain Glin looked at him If you have not heard I think we will not speak yet of that either Master Elrond will summon us all ere long I believe and then we shall all hear many things But there is much else that may be told Throughout the rest of the meal they talked together but Frodo listened more than he spoke for the news of the Shire apart from the Ring seemed small and faraway and unimportant while Glin had much to tell of events in the northern regions of Wilderland Frodo learned that Grimbeorn the Old son of Beorn was now the lord of many sturdy men and to their land between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go lndeed said Glin if it were not for the Beornings the passage from Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible They are valiant men and keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock But their tolls are high he added with a shake of his head and like Beorn of old they are not over fond of dwarves Still they are trusty and that is much in these days Nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the Men of Dale They are good folk the Bardings The grandson of Bard the Bowman rules them Brand son of Bain son of Bard He is a strong king and his realm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth And what of your own people asked Frodo There is much to tell good and bad said Glin yet it is mostly good we have so far been fortunate though we do not escape the shadow of these times If you really wish to hear of us I will tell you tidings gladly But stop me when you are weary Dwarves tongues run on when speaking of their handiwork they say And with that Glin embarked on a long account of the doings of the Dwarfkingdom He was delighted to have found so polite a listener for Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people and places that he had never heard of before He was interested however to hear that Din was still King under the Mountain and was now old having passed his two hundred and fiftieth year venerable and fabulously rich Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven were still with him Dwalin Glin Dori Nori Bifur Bofur and Bombur Bombur was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at table and it took six young dwarves to lift him And what has become of Balin and Ori and in asked Frodo A shadow passed over Glins face We do not know he answered It is largely on account of Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in Rivendell But tonight let us speak of merrier things Glin began then to talk of the works of his people telling Frodo about their great labours in Dale and under the Mountain We have done well he said But in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers many of whose secrets are lost We make good armour and keen swords but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon came Only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days You should see the waterways of Dale Frodo and the fountains and the pools You should see the stonepaved roads of many colours And the halls and cavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees and the terraces and towers upon the Mountains sides Then you would see that we have not been idle I will come and see them if ever I can said Frodo How surprised Bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug Glin looked at Frodo and smiled You were very fond of Bilbo were you not he asked Yes answered Frodo I would rather see him than all the towers and palaces in the world At length the feast came to an end Elrond and Arwen rose and went down the hall and the company followed them in due order The doors were thrown open and they went across a wide passage and through other doors and came into a further hall In it were no tables but a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf This is the Hall of Fire said the wizard Here you will hear many songs and talesif you can keep awake But except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet and people come here who wish for peace and thought There is always a fire here all the year round but there is little other light As Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him elvish minstrels began to make sweet music Slowly the hall filled and Frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair Suddenly he noticed not far from the further end of the fire a small dark figure seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar Beside him on the ground was a drinkingcup and some bread Frodo wondered whether he was ill if people were ever ill in Rivendell and had been unable to come to the feast His head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast and a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face Elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure Awake little master he said with a smile Then turning to Frodo he beckoned to him Now at last the hour has come that you have wished for Frodo he said Here is a friend that you have long missed The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face Bilbo cried Frodo with sudden recognition and he sprang forward Hullo Frodo my lad said Bilbo So you have got here at last I hoped you would manage it Well well So all this feasting is in your honour I hear I hope you enjoyed yourself Why werent you there cried Frodo And why havent I been allowed to see you before Because you were asleep I have seen a good deal of you I have sat by your side with Sam each day But as for the feast I dont go in for such things much now And I had something else to do What were you doing Why sitting and thinking I do a lot of that nowadays and this is the best place to do it in as a rule Wake up indeed he said cocking an eye at Elrond There was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness that Frodo could see Wake up I was not asleep Master Elrond If you want to know you have all come out from your feast too soon and you have disturbed mein the middle of making up a song I was stuck over a line or two and was thinking about them but now I dont suppose I shall ever get them right There will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be driven clean out of my head I shall have to get my friend the Dnadan to help me Where is he Elrond laughed He shall be found he said Then you two shall go into a corner and finish your task and we will hear it and judge it before we end our merrymaking Messengers were sent to find Bilbos friend though none knew where he was or why he had not been present at the feast In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side and Sam came quickly and placed himself near them They talked together in soft voices oblivious of the mirth and music in the hall about them Bilbo had not much to say of himself When he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly along the Road or in the country on either side but somehow he had steered all the time towards Rivendell I got here without much adventure he said and after a rest I went on with the dwarves to Dale my last journey I shant travel again Old Balin had gone away Then I came back here and here I have been I have done this and that I have written some more of my book And of course I make up a few songs They sing them occasionally just to please me I think for of course they arent really good enough for Rivendell And I listen and I think Time doesnt seem to pass here it just is A remarkable place altogether I hear all kinds of news from over the Mountains and out of the South but hardly anything from the Shire I heard about the Ring of course Gandalf has been here often Not that he has told me a great deal he has become closer than ever these last few years The Dnadan has told me more Fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance It is a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner I could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much trouble I have thought several times of going back to Hobbiton for it but I am getting old and they would not let me Gandalf and Elrond I mean They seemed to think that the Enemy was looking high and low for me and would make mincemeat of me if he caught me tottering about in the Wild And Gandalf said The Ring has passed on Bilbo It would do no good to you or to others if you tried to meddle with it again Odd sort of remark just like Gandalf But he said he was looking after you so I let things be I am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound He paused and looked at Frodo doubtfully Have you got it here he asked in a whisper I cant help feeling curious you know after all Ive heard I should very much like just to peep at it again Yes Ive got it answered Frodo feeling a strange reluctance It looks just the same as ever it did Well I should just like to see it for a moment said Bilbo When he had dressed Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain light but strong Slowly he drew it out Bilbo put out his hand But Frodo quickly drew back the Ring To his distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo a shadow seemed to have fallen between them and through it he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands He felt a desire to strike him The music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell Bilbo looked quickly at Frodos face and passed his hand across his eyes I understand now he said Put it away I am sorry sorry you have come in for this burden sorry about everything Dont adventures ever have an end I suppose not Someone else always has to carry on the story Well it cant be helped I wonder if its any good trying to finish my book But dont lets worry about it nowlets have some real News Tell me all about the Shire Frodo hid the Ring away and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory The light and music of Rivendell was about him again Bilbo smiled and laughed happily Every item of news from the Shire that Frodo could tellaided and corrected now and again by Samwas of the greatest interest to him from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in Hobbiton They were so deep in the doings of the Four Farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green cloth For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile Suddenly Bilbo looked up Ah there you are at last Dnadan he cried Strider said Frodo You seem to have a lot of names Well _Strider_ is one that I havent heard before anyway said Bilbo What do you call him that for They call me that in Bree said Strider laughing and that is how I was introduced to him And why do you call him Dnadan asked Frodo _The_ Dnadan said Bilbo He is often called that here But I thought you knew enough Elvish at least to know _dnudan_ Man of the West Nmenorean But this is not the time for lessons He turned to Strider Where have you been my friend Why werent you at the feast The Lady Arwen was there Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely I know he said But often I must put mirth aside Elladan and Elrohir have returned out of the Wild unlookedfor and they had tidings that I wished to hear at once Well my dear fellow said Bilbo now youve heard the news cant you spare me a moment I want your help in something urgent Elrond says this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening and I am stuck Lets go off into a corner and polish it up Strider smiled Come then he said Let me hear it Frodo was left to himself for a while for Sam had fallen asleep He was alone and felt rather forlorn although all about him the folk of Rivendell were gathered But those near him were silent intent upon the music of the voices and the instruments and they gave no heed to anything else Frodo began to listen At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elventongues even though he understood them little held him in a spell as soon as he began to attend to them Almost it seemed that the words took shape and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world Then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended it became part of the throbbing air about him and it drenched and drowned him Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep There he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water and then suddenly into a voice It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses Faint at first and then clearer ran the words Erendil was a mariner that tarried in Arvernien he built a boat of timber felled in Nimbrethil to journey in her sails he wove of silver fair of silver were her lanterns made her prow was fashioned like a swan and light upon her banners laid In panoply of ancient kings in chaind rings he armoured him his shining shield was scored with runes to ward all wounds and harm from him his bow was made of dragonhorn his arrows shorn of ebony of silver was his habergeon his scabbard of chalcedony his sword of steel was valiant of adamant his helmet tall an eagleplume upon his crest upon his breast an emerald Beneath the Moon and under star he wandered far from northern strands bewildered on enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal lands From gnashing of the Narrow Ice where shadow lies on frozen hills from nether heats and burning waste he turned in haste and roving still on starless waters far astray at last he came to Night of Naught and passed and never sight he saw of shining shore nor light he sought The winds of wrath came driving him and blindly in the foam he fled from west to east and errandless unheralded he homeward sped There flying Elwing came to him and flame was in the darkness lit more bright than light of diamond the fire upon her carcanet The Silmaril she bound on him and crowned him with the living light and dauntless then with burning brow he turned his prow and in the night from Otherworld beyond the Sea there strong and free a storm arose a wind of power in Tarmenel by paths that seldom mortal goes his boat it bore with biting breath as might of death across the grey and longforsaken seas distressed from east to west he passed away Through Evernight he back was borne on black and roaring waves that ran oer leagues unlit and foundered shores that drowned before the Days began until he heard on strands of pearl when ends the world the music long where ever foaming billows roll the yellow gold and jewels wan He saw the Mountain silent rise where twilight lies upon the knees of Valinor and Eldamar beheld afar beyond the seas A wanderer escaped from night to haven white he came at last to Elvenhome the green and fair where keen the air where pale as glass beneath the Hill of Ilmarin aglimmer in a valley sheer the lamplit towers of Tirion are mirrored on the Shadowmere He tarried there from errantry and melodies they taught to him and sages old him marvels told and harps of gold they brought to him They clothed him then in elvenwhite and seven lights before him sent as through the Calacirian to hidden land forlorn he went He came unto the timeless halls where shining fall the countless years and endless reigns theElder King in Ilmarin on Mountain sheer and words unheard were spoken then of folk of Men and Elvenkin beyond the world were visions showed forbid to those that dwell therein A ship then new they built for him of mithril and of elvenglass with shining prow no shaven oar nor sail she bore on silver mast the Silmaril as lantern light and banner bright with living flame to gleam thereon by Elbereth herself was set who thither came and wings immortal made for him and laid on him undying doom to sail the shoreless skies and come behind the Sun and light of Moon From Everevens lofty hills where softly silver fountains fall his wings him bore a wandering light beyond the mighty Mountain Wall From Worlds End then he turned away and yearned again to find afar his home through shadows journeying and burning as an island star on high above the mists he came a distant flame before the Sun a wonder ere the waking dawn where grey the Norland waters run And over Middleearth he passed and heard at last the weeping sore of women and of elvenmaids in Elder Days in years of yore gut on him mighty doom was laid till Moon should fade an orbd star to pass and tarry never more on Hither Shores where mortals are for ever still a herald on an errand that should never rest to bear his shining lamp afar the Flammifer of Westernesse The chanting ceased Frodo opened his eyes and saw that Bilbo was seated on his stool in a circle of listeners who were smiling and applauding Now we had better have it again said an Elf Bilbo got up and bowed I am flattered Lindir he said But it would be too tiring to repeat it all Not too tiring for you the Elves answered laughing You know you are never tired of reciting your own verses But really we cannot answer your question at one hearing What cried Bilbo You cant tell which parts were mine and which were the Dnadans It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals said the Elf Nonsense Lindir snorted Bilbo If you cant distinguish between a Man and a Hobbit your judgement is poorer than I imagined Theyre as different as peas and apples Maybe To sheep other sheep no doubt appear different laughed Lindir Or to shepherds But Mortals have not been our study We have other business I wont argue with you said Bilbo I am sleepy after so much music and singing Ill leave you to guess if you want to He got up and came towards Frodo Well thats over he said in a low voice It went off better than I expected I dont often get asked for a second hearing What did you think of it I am not going to try and guess said Frodo smiling You neednt said Bilbo As a matter of fact it was all mine Except that Aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone He seemed to think it important I dont know why Otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing rather above my head and he said that if I had the cheek to make verses about Erendil in the house of Elrond it was my affair I suppose he was right I dont know said Frodo It seemed to me to fit somehow though I cant explain I was half asleep when you began and it seemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about I didnt understand that it was really you speaking until near the end It _is_ difficult to keep awake here until you get used to it said Bilbo Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for music and poetry and tales They seem to like them as much as food or more They will be going on for a long time yet What do you say to slipping off for some more quiet talk Can we said Frodo Of course This is merrymaking not business Come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noise They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows and made for the doors Sam they left behind fast asleep still with a smile on his face In spite of his delight in Bilbos company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they passed out of the Hall of Fire Even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in song A Elbereth Gilthoniel silivren penna mriel o menel aglar elenath Nachaered palandriel o galadhremmin ennorath Fanuilos le linnathon nef aear s nef aearon Frodo halted for a moment looking back Elrond was in his chair and the fire was on his face like summerlight upon the trees Near him sat the Lady Arwen To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her his dark cloak was thrown back and he seemed to be clad in elvenmail and a star shone on his breast They spoke together and then suddenly it seemed to Frodo that Arwen turned towards him and the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart He stood still enchanted while the sweet syllables of the elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody It is a song to Elbereth said Bilbo They will sing that and other songs of the Blessed Realm many times tonight Come on He led Frodo back to his own little room It opened on to the gar dens and looked south across the ravine of the Bruinen There they sat for some while looking through the window at the bright stars above the steepclimbing woods and talking softly They spoke no more of the small news of the Shire far away nor of the dark shadows and perils that encompassed them but of the fair things they had seen in the world together of the Elves of the stars of trees and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods At last there came a knock on the door Begging your pardon said Sam putting in his head but I was just wondering if you would be wanting anything And begging yours Sam Gamgee replied Bilbo I guess you mean that it is time your master went to bed Well sir there is a Council early tomorrow I hear and he only got up today for the first time Quite right Sam laughed Bilbo You can trot off and tell Gandalf that he has gone to bed Good night Frodo Bless me but it has been good to see you again There are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good talk I am getting very old and I began to wonder if I should ever live to see your chapters of our story Good night Ill take a walk I think and look at the stars of Elbereth in the garden Sleep well _Chapter 2_ The Council of Elrond Next day Frodo woke early feeling refreshed and well He walked along the terraces above the loudflowing Bruinen and watched the pale cool sun rise above the far mountains and shine down Slanting through the thin silver mist the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush Sam walked beside him saying nothing but sniffing the air and looking every now and again with wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the East The snow was white upon their peaks On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk Hullo Good morning said Bilbo Feel ready for the great council I feel ready for anything answered Frodo But most of all I should like to go walking today and explore the valley I should like to get into those pinewoods up there He pointed away far up the side of Rivendell to the north You may have a chance later said Gandalf But we cannot make any plans yet There is much to hear and decide today Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out That is the warning bell for the Council of Elrond cried Gandalf Come along now Both you and Bilbo are wanted Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back to the house behind them uninvited and for the moment forgotten trotted Sam Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the evening before The light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valley The noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming riverbed Birds were singing and a wholesome peace lay on the land To Frodo his dangerous flight and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave Elrond was there and several others were seated in silence about him Frodo saw Glorfindel and Glin and in a corner alone Strider was sitting clad in his old travelworn clothes again Elrond drew Frodo to a seat by his side and presented him to the company saying Here my friends is the hobbit Frodo son of Drogo Few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent He then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before There was a younger dwarf at Glins side his son Gimli Beside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors of Elronds household of whom Erestor was the chief and with him was Galdor an Elf from the Grey Havens who had come on an errand from Crdan the Shipwright There was also a strange Elf clad in green and brown Legolas a messenger from his father Thranduil the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood And seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face darkhaired and greyeyed proud and stern of glance He was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback and indeed though his garments were rich and his cloak was lined with fur they were stained with long travel He had a collar of silver in which a single white stone was set his locks were shorn about his shoulders On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees He gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder Here said Elrond turning to Gandalf is Boromir a man from the South He arrived in the grey morning and seeks for counsel I have bidden him to be present for here his questions will be answered Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told Much was said of events in the world outside especially in the South and in the wide lands east of the Mountains Of these things Frodo had already heard many rumours but the tale of Glin was new to him and when the dwarf spoke he listened attentively It appeared that amid the splendour of their works of hand the hearts of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were troubled It is now many years ago said Glin that a shadow of disquiet fell upon our people Whence it came we did not at first perceive Words began to be whispered in secret it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world Some spoke of Moria the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own tongue Khazaddm and they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to return Glin sighed Moria Moria Wonder of the Northern world Too deep we delved there and woke the nameless fear Long have its vast mansions lain empty since the children of Durin fled But now we spoke of it again with longing and yet with dread for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of Khazaddm for many lives of kings save Thrr only and he perished At last however Balin listened to the whispers and resolved to go and though Din did not give leave willingly he took with him Ori and in and many of our folk and they went away south That was nigh on thirty years ago For a while we had news and it seemed good messages reported that Moria had been entered and a great work begun there Then there was silence and no word has ever come from Moria since Then about a year ago a messenger came to Din but not from Moria from Mordor a horseman in the night who called Din to his gate The Lord Sauron the Great so he said wished for our friendship Rings he would give for it such as he gave of old And he asked urgently concerning _hobbits_ of what kind they were and where they dwelt For Sauron knows said he that one of these was known to you on a time At this we were greatly troubled and we gave no answer And then his fell voice was lowered and he would have sweetened it if he could As a small token only of your friendship Sauron asks this he said that you should find this thief such was his word and get from him willing or no a little ring the least of rings that once he stole It is but a trifle that Sauron fancies and an earnest of your good will Find it and three rings that the Dwarf sires possessed of old shall be returned to you and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever Find only news of the thief whether he still lives and where and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the Lord Refuse and things will not seem so well Do you refuse At that his breath came like the hiss of snakes and all who stood by shuddered but Din said I say neither yea nor nay I must consider this message and what it means under its fair cloak Consider well but not too long said he The time of my thought is my own to spend answered Din For the present said he and rode into the darkness Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night We needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held both menace and deceit for we knew already that the power that has reentered Mordor has not changed and ever it betrayed us of old Twice the messenger has returned and has gone unanswered The third and last time so he says is soon to come before the ending of the year And so I have been sent at last by Din to warn Bilbo that he is sought by the Enemy and to learn if may be why he desires this ring this least of rings Also we crave the advice of Elrond For the Shadow grows and draws nearer We discover that messengers have come also to King Brand in Dale and that he is afraid We fear that he may yield Already war is gathering on his eastern borders If we make no answer the Enemy may move Men of his rule to assail King Brand and Din also You have done well to come said Elrond You will hear today all that you need in order to understand the purposes of the Enemy There is naught that you can do other than to resist with hope or without it But you do not stand alone You will learn that your trouble is but part of the trouble of all the western world The Ring What shall we do with the Ring the least of rings the trifle that Sauron fancies That is the doom that we must deem That is the purpose for which you are called hither Called I say though I have not called you to me strangers from distant lands You have come and are here met in this very nick of time by chance as it may seem Yet it is not so Believe rather that it is so ordered that we who sit here and none others must now find counsel for the peril of the world Now therefore things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all but a few until this day And first so that all may understand what is the peril the Tale of the Ring shall be told from the beginning even to this present And I will begin that tale though others shall end it Then all listened while Elrond in his clear voice spoke of Sauron and the Rings of Power and their forging in the Second Age of the world long ago A part of his tale was known to some there but the full tale to none and many eyes were turned t Elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the Elvensmiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria and their eagerness for knowledge by which Sauron ensnared them For in that time he was not yet evil to behold and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft whereas he learned all their secrets and betrayed them and forged secretly in the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be their master But Celebrimbor was aware of him and hid the Three which he had made and there was war and the land was laid waste and the gate of Moria was shut Then through all the years that followed he traced the Ring but since that history is elsewhere recounted even as Elrond himself set it down in his books of lore it is not here recalled For it is a long tale full of deeds great and terrible and briefly though Elrond spoke the sun rode up the sky and the morning was passing ere he ceased Of Nmenor he spoke its glory and its fall and the return of the Kings of Men to Middleearth out of the deeps of the Sea borne upon the wings of storm Then Elendil the Tall and his mighty sons Isildur and Anrion became great lords and the Northrealm they made in Arnor and the Southrealm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin But Sauron of Mordor assailed them and they made the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and the hosts of Gilgalad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor Thereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed I remember well the splendour of their banners he said It recalled to me the glory of the Elder Days and the hosts of Beleriand so many great princes and captains were assembled And yet not so many nor so fair as when Thangorodrim was broken and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever and it was not so You remember said Frodo speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment But I thought he stammered as Elrond turned towards him I thought that the fall of Gilgalad was a long age ago So it was indeed answered Elrond gravely But my memory reaches back even to the Elder Days Erendil was my sire who was born in Gondolin before its fall and my mother was Elwing daughter of Dior son of Lthien of Doriath I have seen three ages in the West of the world and many defeats and many fruitless victories I was the herald of Gilgalad and marched with his host I was at the Battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor where we had the mastery for the Spear of Gilgalad and the Sword of Elendil Aiglos and Narsil none could withstand I beheld the last combat on the slopes of Orodruin where Gilgalad died and Elendil fell and Narsil broke beneath him but Sauron himself was overthrown and Isildur cut the Ring from his hand with the hiltshard of his fathers sword and took it for his own At this the stranger Boromir broke in So that is what became of the Ring he cried If ever such a tale was told in the South it has long been forgotten I have heard of the Great Ring of him that we do not name but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first realm Isildur took it That is tidings indeed Alas yes said Elrond Isildur took it as should not have been It should have been cast then into Orodruins fire nigh at hand where it was made But few marked what Isildur did He alone stood by his father in that last mortal contest and by Gilgalad only Crdan stood and I But Isildur would not listen to our counsel This I will have as weregild for my father and my brother he said and therefore whether we would or no he took it to treasure it But soon he was betrayed by it to his death and so it is named in the North Isildurs Bane Yet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen him Only to the North did these tidings come and only to a few Small wonder it is that you have not heard them Boromir From the ruin of the Gladden Fields where Isildur perished three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering One of these was Ohtar the esquire of Isildur who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil and he brought them to Valandil the heir of Isildur who being but a child had remained here in Rivendell But Narsil was broken and its light extinguished and it has not yet been forged again Fruitless did I call the victory of the Last Alliance Not wholly so yet it did not achieve its end Sauron was diminished but not destroyed His Ring was lost but not unmade The Dark Tower was broken but its foundations were not removed for they were made with the power of the Ring and while it remains they will endure Many Elves and many mighty Men and many of their friends had perished in the war Anrion was slain and Isildur was slain and Gilgalad and Elendil were no more Never again shall there be any such league of Elves and Men for Men multiply and the Firstborn decrease and the two kindreds are estranged And ever since that day the race of Nmenor has decayed and the span of their years has lessened In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the Men of Westernesse were diminished and their city of Annminas beside Lake Evendim fell into ruin and the heirs of Valandil removed and dwelt at Fornost on the high North Downs and that now too is desolate Men call it Deadmens Dike and they fear to tread there For the folk of Arnor dwindled and their foes devoured them and their lordship passed leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills In the South the realm of Gondor long endured and for a while its splendour grew recalling somewhat of the might of Nmenor ere it fell High towers that people built and strong places and havens of many ships and the winged crown of the Kings of Men was held in awe by folk of many tongues Their chief city was Osgiliath Citadel of the Stars through the midst of which the River flowed And Minas Ithil they built Tower of the Rising Moon eastward upon a shoulder of the Mountains of Shadow and westward at the feet of the White Mountains Minas Anor they made Tower of the Setting Sun There in the courts of the King grew a white tree from the seed of that tree which Isildur brought over the deep waters and the seed of that tree before came from Eressa and before that out of the Uttermost West in the Day before days when the world was young But in the wearing of the swift years of Middleearth the line of Meneldil son of Anrion failed and the Tree withered and the blood of the Nmenoreans became mingled with that of lesser men Then the watch upon the walls of Mordor slept and dark things crept back to Gorgoroth And on a time evil things came forth and they took Minas Ithil and abode in it and they made it into a place of dread and it is called Minas Morgul the Tower of Sorcery Then Minas Anor was named anew Minas Tirith the Tower of Guard and these two cities were ever at war but Osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked So it has been for many lives of men But the Lords of Minas Tirith still fight on defying our enemies keeping the passage of the River from Argonath to the Sea And now that part of the tale that I shall tell is drawn to its close For in the days of Isildur the Ruling Ring passed out of all knowledge and the Three were released from its dominion But now in this latter day they are in peril once more for to our sorrow the One has been found Others shall speak of its finding for in that I played small part He ceased but at once Boromir stood up tall and proud before them Give me leave Master Elrond said he first to say more of Gondor for verily from the land of Gondor I am come And it would be well for all to know what passes there For few I deem know of our deeds and therefore guess little of their peril if we should fail at last Believe not that in the land of Gondor the blood of Nmenor is spent nor all its pride and dignity forgotten By our valour the wild folk of the East are still restrained and the terror of Morgul kept at bay and thus alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us bulwark of the West But if the passages of the River should be won what then Yet that hour maybe is not now far away The Nameless Enemy has arisen again Smoke rises once more from Orodruin that we call Mount Doom The power of the Black Land grows and we are hard beset When the Enemy returned our folk were driven from Ithilien our fair domain east of the River though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms But this very year in the days of June sudden war came upon us out of Mordor and we were swept away We were outnumbered for Mordor has allied itself with the Easterlings and the cruel Haradrim but it was not by numbers that we were defeated A power was there that we have not felt before Some said that it could be seen like a great black horseman a dark shadow under the moon Wherever he came a madness filled our foes but fear fell on our boldest so that horse and man gave way and fled Only a remnant of our eastern force came back destroying the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of Osgiliath I was in the company that held the bridge until it was cast down behind us Four only were saved by swimming my brother and myself and two others But still we fight on holding all the west shores of Anduin and those who shelter behind us give us praise if ever they hear our name much praise but little help Only from Rohan now will any men ride to us when we call In this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues to Elrond a hundred and ten days I have journeyed all alone But I do not seek allies in war The might of Elrond is in wisdom not in weapons it is said I come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words For on the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again and once to me In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing thunder but in the West a pale light lingered and out of it I heard a voice remote but clear crying Seek for the Sword that was broken In Imladris it dwells There shall be counsels taken Stronger than Morgulspells There shall be shown a token That Doom is near at hand For Isildurs Bane shall waken And the Halfling forth shall stand Of these words we could understand little and we spoke to our father Denethor Lord of Minas Tirith wise in the lore of Gondor This only would he say that Imladris was of old the name among the Elves of a far northern dale where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt greatest of loremasters Therefore my brother seeing how desperate was our need was eager to heed the dream and seek for Imladris but since the way was full of doubt and danger I took the journey upon myself Loth was my father to give me leave and long have I wandered by roads forgotten seeking the house of Elrond of which many had heard but few knew where it lay And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you said Aragorn standing up He cast his sword upon the table that stood before Elrond and the blade was in two pieces Here is the Sword that was Broken he said And who are you and what have you to do with Minas Tirith asked Boromir looking in wonder at the lean face of the Ranger and his weatherstained cloak He is Aragorn son of Arathorn said Elrond and he is descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendils son of Minas Ithil He is the Chief of the Dnedain in the North and few are now left of that folk Then it belongs to you and not to me at all cried Frodo in amazement springing to his feet as if he expected the Ring to be demanded at once It does not belong to either of us said Aragorn but it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while Bring out the Ring Frodo said Gandalf solemnly The time has come Hold it up and then Boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle There was a hush and all turned their eyes on Frodo He was shaken by a sudden shame and fear and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the Ring and a loathing of its touch He wished he was far away The Ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand Behold Isildurs Bane said Elrond Boromirs eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing The Halfling he muttered Is then the doom of Minas Tirith come at last But why then should we seek a broken sword The words were not _the doom of Minas Tirith_ said Aragorn But doom and great deeds are indeed at hand For the Sword that was Broken is the Sword of Elendil that broke beneath him when he fell It has been treasured by his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost for it was spoken of old among us that it should be made again when the Ring Isildurs Bane was found Now you have seen the sword that you have sought what would you ask Do you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor I was not sent to beg any boon but to seek only the meaning of a riddle answered Boromir proudly Yet we are hard pressed and the Sword of Elendil would be a help beyond our hopeif such a thing could indeed return out of the shadows of the past He looked again at Aragorn and doubt was in his eyes Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side Evidently he was annoyed on his friends behalf Standing suddenly up he burst out All that is gold does not glitter Not all those who wander are lost The old that is strong does not wither Deep roots are not reached by the frost From the ashes a fire shall be woken A light from the shadows shall spring Renewed shall be blade that was broken The crownless again shall be king_ Not very good perhaps but to the point if you need more beyond the word of Elrond If that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to hear you had best listen to it He sat down with a snort I made that up myself he whispered to Frodo for the Dnadan a long time ago when he first told me about himself I almost wish that my adventures were not over and that I could go with him when his day comes Aragorn smiled at him then he turned to Boromir again For my part I forgive your doubt he said Little do I resemble the figures of Elendil and Isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of Denethor I am but the heir of Isildur not Isildur himself I have had a hard life and a long and the leagues that lie between here and Gondor are a small part in the count of my journeys I have crossed many mountains and many rivers and trodden many plains even into the far countries of Rhn and Harad where the stars are strange But my home such as I have is in the North For here the heirs of Valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many generations Our days have darkened and we have dwindled but ever the Sword has passed to a new keeper And this I will say to you Boromir ere I end Lonely men are we Rangers of the wild hunters but hunters ever of the servants of the Enemy for they are found in many places not in Mordor only If Gondor Boromir has been a stalwart tower we have played another part Many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do not stay You know little of the lands beyond your bounds Peace and freedom do you say The North would have known them little but for us Fear would have destroyed them But when dark things come from the houseless hills or creep from sunless woods they fly from us What roads would any dare to tread what safety would there be in quiet lands or in the homes of simple men at night if the Dnedain were asleep or were all gone into the grave And yet less thanks have we than you Travellers scowl at us and countrymen give us scornful names Strider I am to one fat man who lives within a days march of foes that would freeze his heart or lay his little town in ruin if he were not guarded ceaselessly Yet we would not have it otherwise If simple folk are free from care and fear simple they will be and we must be secret to keep them so That has been the task of my kindred while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown But now the world is changing once again A new hour comes Isildurs Bane is found Battle is at hand The Sword shall be reforged I will come to Minas Tirith Isildurs Bane is found you say said Boromir I have seen a bright ring in the Halflings hand but Isildur perished ere this age of the world began they say How do the Wise know that this ring is his And how has it passed down the years until it is brought hither by so strange a messenger That shall be told said Elrond But not yet I beg Master said Bilbo Already the Sun is climbing to noon and I feel the need of something to strengthen me I had not named you said Elrond smiling But I do so now Come Tell us your tale And if you have not yet cast your story into verse you may tell it in plain words The briefer the sooner shall you be refreshed Very well said Bilbo I will do as you bid But I will now tell the true story and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise he looked sidelong at Glin I ask them to forget it and forgive me I only wished to claim the treasure as my very own in those days and to be rid of the name of thief that was put on me But perhaps I understand things a little better now Anyway this is what happened To some there Bilbos tale was wholly new and they listened with amazement while the old hobbit actually not at all displeased recounted his adventure with Gollum at full length He did not omit a single riddle He would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the Shire if he had been allowed but Elrond raised his hand Well told my friend he said but that is enough at this time For the moment it suffices to know that the Ring passed to Frodo your heir Let him now speak Then less willingly than Bilbo Frodo told of all his dealings with the Ring from the day that it passed into his keeping Every step of his journey from Hobbiton to the Ford of Bruinen was questioned and considered and everything that he could recall concerning the Black Riders was examined At last he sat down again Not bad Bilbo said to him You would have made a good story of it if they hadnt kept on interrupting I tried to make a few notes but we shall have to go over it all again together some time if I am to write it up There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here Yes it made quite a long tale answered Frodo But the story still does not seem complete to me I still want to know a good deal especially about Gandalf Galdor of the Havens who sat near by overheard him You speak for me also he cried and turning to Elrond he said The Wise may have good reason to believe that the halflings trove is indeed the Great Ring of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who know less But may we not hear the proofs And I would ask this also What of Saruman He is learned in the lore of the Rings yet he is not among us What is his counselif he knows the things that we have heard The questions that you ask Galdor are bound together said Elrond I had not overlooked them and they shall be answered But these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear and I call upon him last for it is the place of honour and in all this matter he has been the chief Some Galdor said Gandalf would think the tidings of Glin and the pursuit of Frodo proof enough that the halflings trove is a thing of great worth to the Enemy Yet it is a ring What then The Nine the Nazgl keep The Seven are taken or destroyed At this Glin stirred but did not speak The Three we know of What then is this one that he desires so much There is indeed a wide waste of time between the River and the Mountain between the loss and the finding But the gap in the knowledge of the Wise has been filled at last Yet too slowly For the Enemy has been close behind closer even than I feared And well is it that not until this year this very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur and secretly explored his ways and found thus that our fears were true he was none other than Sauron our Enemy of old at length taking shape and power again Some too will remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him and for long we watched him only Yet at last as his shadow grew Saruman yielded and the Council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of Mirkwood and that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring a strange chance if chance it was But we were too late as Elrond foresaw Sauron also had watched us and had long prepared against our stroke governing Mordor from afar through Minas Morgul where his Nine servants dwelt until all was ready Then he gave way before us but only feigned to flee and soon after came to the Dark Tower and openly declared himself Then for the last time the Council met for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the One We feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing of But Saruman said nay and repeated what he had said to us before that the One would never again be found in Middleearth At the worst said he our Enemy knows that we have it not and that it still is lost But what was lost may yet be found he thinks Fear not His hope will cheat him Have I not earnestly studied this matter Into Anduin the Great it fell and long ago while Sauron slept it was rolled down the River to the Sea There let it lie until the End Gandalf fell silent gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the Misty Mountains at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden He sighed There I was at fault he said I was lulled by the words of Saruman the Wise but I should have sought for the truth sooner and our peril would now be less We were all at fault said Elrond and but for your vigilance the Darkness maybe would already be upon us But say on From the first my heart misgave me against all reason that I knew said Gandalf and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum and how long he had possessed it So I set a watch for him guessing that he would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure He came but he escaped and was not found And then alas I let the matter rest watching and waiting only as we have too often done Time passed with many cares until my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear Whence came the hobbits ring What if my fear was true should be done with it Those things I must decide But I spoke yet of my dread to none knowing the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray In all the long wars with the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest foe That was seventeen years ago Soon I became aware that spies of many sorts even beasts and birds were gathered round the Shire and my fear grew I called for the help of the Dnedain and their watch was doubled and I opened my heart to Aragorn the heir of Isildur And I said Aragorn counselled that we should hunt for Gollum too late though it may seem And since it seemed fit that Isildurs heir should labour to repair Isildurs fault I went with Gandalf on the long and hopeless search Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor There we had rumour of him and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills but we never found him and at last I despaired And then in my despair I thought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded The ring itself might tell if it were the One The memory of words at the Council came back to me words of Saruman halfheeded at the time I heard them now clearly in my heart The Nine the Seven and the Three he said had each their proper gem Not so the One It was round and unadorned as it were one of the lesser rings but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled maybe could still see and read What those marks were he had not said Who now would know The maker And Saruman But great though his lore may be it must have a source What hand save Saurons ever held this thing ere it was lost The hand of Isildur alone With that thought I forsook the chase and passed swiftly to Gondor In former days the members of my order had been well received there but Saruman most of all Often he had been for long the guest of the Lords of the City Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old and grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books If indeed you look only as you say for records of ancient days and the beginnings of the City read on he said For to me what was is less dark than what is to come and that is my care But unless you have more skill even than Saruman who has studied here long you will find naught that is not well known to me who am master of the lore of this City So said Denethor And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few now can read even of the loremasters for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men And Boromir there lies in Minas Tirith still unread I guess by any save Saruman and myself since the kings failed a scroll that Isildur made himself For Isildur did not march away straight from the war in Mordor as some have told the tale Some in the North maybe Boromir broke in All know in Gondor that he went first to Minas Anor and dwelt a while with his nephew Meneldil instructing him before he committed to him the rule of the South Kingdom In that time he planted there the last sapling of the White Tree in memory of his brother But in that time also he made this scroll said Gandalf and that is not remembered in Gondor it would seem For this scroll concerns the Ring and thus wrote Isildur therein _The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom but records of it shall be left in Gondor where also dwell the heirs of Elendil lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow dim_ And after these words Isildur described the Ring such as he found it _It was hot when I first took it hot as a glede and my hand was scorched so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain of it Yet even as I write it is cooled and it seemeth to shrink though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shape Already the writing upon it which at first was as clear as red flame fadeth and is now only barely to be read It is fashioned in an elvenscript of Eregion for they have no letters in Mordor for such subtle work but the language is unknown to me I deem it to be a tongue of the Black Land since it is foul and uncouth What evil it saith I do not know but I trace here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall The Ring misseth maybe the heat of Saurons hand which was black and yet burned like fire and so Gilgalad was destroyed and maybe were the gold made hot again the writing would be refreshed But for my part I will risk no hurt to this thing of all the works of Sauron the only fair It is precious to me though I buy it with great pain_ When I read these words my quest was ended For the traced writing was indeed as Isildur guessed in the tongue of Mordor and the servants of the Tower And what was said therein was already known For in the day that Sauron first put on the One Celebrimbor maker of the Three was aware of him and from afar he heard him speak these words and so his evil purposes were revealed At once I took my leave of Denethor but even as I went northwards messages came to me out of Lrien that Aragorn had passed that way and that he had found the creature called Gollum Therefore I went first to meet him and hear his tale Into what deadly perils he had gone alone I dared not guess There is little need to tell of them said Aragorn If a man must needs walk in sight of the Black Gate or tread the deadly flowers of Morgul Vale then perils he will have I too despaired at last and I began my homeward journey And then by fortune I came suddenly on what I sought the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool But now the trail was fresh and swift and it led not to Mordor but away Along the skirts of the Dead Marshes I followed it and then I had him Lurking by a stagnant mere peering in the water as the dark eve fell I caught him Gollum He was covered with green slime He will never love me I fear for he bit me and I was not gentle Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks of his teeth I deemed it the worst part of all my journey the road back watching him day and night making him walk before me with a halter on his neck gagged until he was tamed by lack of drink and food driving him ever towards Mirkwood I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves for we had agreed that this should be done and I was glad to be rid of his company for he stank For my part I hope never to look upon him again but Gandalf came and endured long speech with him Yes long and weary said Gandalf but not without profit For one thing the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now told openly for the first time but that mattered little since I had already guessed it But I learned then first that Gollums ring came out of the Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields And I learned also that he had possessed it long Many lives of his small kind The power of the ring had lengthened his years far beyond their span but that power only the Great Rings wield And if that is not proof enough Galdor there is the other test that I spoke of Upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft round and unadorned the letters that Isildur reported may still be read if one has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while That I have done and this I have read _Ash nazg durbatulk ash nazg gimbatul ash nazg thrakatulk agh burzumishi krimpatul_ The change in the wizards voice was astounding Suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh as stone A shadow seemed to pass over the high sun and the porch for a moment grew dark All trembled and the Elves stopped their ears Never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in Imladris Gandalf the Grey said Elrond as the shadow passed and the company breathed once more And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again answered Gandalf Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon Master Elrond For if that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West then let all put doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the Wise have declared the treasure of the Enemy fraught with all his malice and in it lies a great part of his strength of old Out of the Black Years come the words that the Smiths of Eregion heard and knew that they had been betrayed _One Ring to rule them all One Ring to find them One Ring to bring them all and in the Darkness bind them_ Know also my friends that I learned more yet from Gollum He was loth to speak and his tale was unclear but it is beyond all doubt that he went to Mordor and there all that he knew was forced from him Thus the Enemy knows now that the One is found that it was long in the Shire and since his servants have pursued it almost to our door he soon will know already he may know even as I speak that we have it here All sat silent for a while until at length Boromir spoke He is a small thing you say this Gollum Small but great in mischief What became of him To what doom did you put him He is in prison but no worse said Aragorn He had suffered much There is no doubt that he was tormented and the fear of Sauron lies black on his heart Still I for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful Elves of Mirkwood His malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be believed in one so lean and withered He could work much mischief still if he were free And I do not doubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some evil errand Alas alas cried Legolas and in his fair elvish face there was great distress The tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told They are not good but only here have I learned how evil they may seem to this company Smagol who is now called Gollum has escaped Escaped cried Aragorn That is ill news indeed We shall all rue it bitterly I fear How came the folk of Thranduil to fail in their trust Not through lack of watchfulness said Legolas but perhaps through overkindliness And we fear that the prisoner had aid from others and that more is known of our doings than we could wish We guarded this creature day and night at Gandalfs bidding much though we wearied of the task But Gandalf bade us hope still for his cure and we had not the heart to keep him ever in dungeons under the earth where he would fall back into his old black thoughts You were less tender to me said Glin with a flash of his eyes as old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the deep places of the Elvenkings halls Now come said Gandalf Pray do not interrupt my good Glin That was a regrettable misunderstanding long set right If all the grievances that stand between Elves and Dwarves are to be brought up here we may as well abandon this Council Glin rose and bowed and Legolas continued In the days of fair weather we led Gollum through the woods and there was a high tree standing alone far from the others which he liked to climb Often we let him mount up to the highest branches until he felt the free wind but we set a guard at the trees foot One day he refused to come down and the guards had no mind to climb after him he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as well as with his hands so they sat by the tree far into the night It was that very night of summer yet moonless and starless that Orcs came on us at unawares We drove them off after some time they were many and fierce but they came from over the mountains and were unused to the woods When the battle was over we found that Gollum was gone and his guards were slain or taken It then seemed plain to us that the attack had been made for his rescue and that he knew of it beforehand How that was contrived we cannot guess but Gollum is cunning and the spies of the Enemy are many The dark things that were driven out in the year of the Dragons fall have returned in greater numbers and Mirkwood is again an evil place save where our realm is maintained We have failed to recapture Gollum We came on his trail among those of many Orcs and it plunged deep into the Forest going south But ere long it escaped our skill and we dared not continue the hunt for we were drawing nigh to Dol Guldur and that is still a very evil place we do not go that way Well well he is gone said Gandalf We have no time to seek for him again He must do what he will But he may play a part yet that neither he nor Sauron have foreseen And now I will answer Galdors other questions What of Saruman What are his counsels to us in this need This tale I must tell in full for only Elrond has heard it yet and that in brief but it will bear on all that we must resolve It is the last chapter in the Tale of the Ring so far as it has yet gone At the end of June I was in the Shire but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind and I rode to the southern borders of the little land for I had a foreboding of some danger still hidden from me but drawing near There messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in Gondor and when I heard of the Black Shadow a chill smote my heart But I found nothing save a few fugitives from the South yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they would not speak I turned then east and north and journeyed along the Greenway and not far from Bree I came upon a traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him It was Radagast the Brown who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel near the borders of Mirkwood He is one of my order but I had not seen him for many a year Gandalf he cried I was seeking you But I am a stranger in these parts All I knew was that you might be found in a wild region with the uncouth name of Shire Your information was correct I said But do not put it that way if you meet any of the inhabitants You are near the borders of the Shire now And what do you want with me It must be pressing You were never a traveller unless driven by great need I have an urgent errand he said My news is evil Then he looked about him as if the hedges might have ears Nazgl he whispered The Nine are abroad again They have crossed the River secretly and are moving westward They have taken the guise of riders in black I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it The enemy must have some great need or purpose said Radagast but what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts I cannot guess What do you mean said I I have been told that wherever they go the Riders ask for news of a land called Shire _The_ Shire I said but my heart sank For even the Wise might fear to withstand the Nine when they are gathered together under their fell chieftain A great king and sorcerer he was of old and now he wields a deadly fear Who told you and who sent you I asked Saruman the White answered Radagast And he told me to say that if you feel the need he will help but you must seek his aid at once or it will be too late And that message brought me hope For Saruman the White is the greatest of my order Radagast is of course a worthy Wizard a master of shapes and changes of hue and he has much lore of herbs and beasts and birds are especially his friends But Saruman has long studied the arts of the Enemy himself and thus we have often been able to forestall him It was by the devices of Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur It might be that he had found some weapons that would drive back the Nine I will go to Saruman I said Then you must go _now_ said Radagast for I have wasted time in looking for you and the days are running short I was told to find you before Midsummer and that is now here Even if you set out from this spot you will hardly reach him before the Nine discover the land that they seek I myself shall turn back at once And with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off Stay a moment I said We shall need your help and the help of all things that will give it Send out messages to all the beasts and birds that are your friends Tell them to bring news of anything that bears on this matter to Saruman and Gandalf Let messages be sent to Orthanc I will do that he said and rode off as if the Nine were after him I could not follow him then and there I had ridden very far already that day and I was as weary as my horse and I needed to consider matters I stayed the night in Bree and decided that I had no time to return to the Shire Never did I make a greater mistake However I wrote a message to Frodo and trusted to my friend the innkeeper to send it to him I rode away at dawn and I came at long last to the dwelling of Saruman That is far south in Isengard in the end of the Misty Mountains not far from the Gap of Rohan And Boromir will tell you that that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains and the northmost foothills of Ered Nimrais the White Mountains of his home But Isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called Orthanc It was not made by Saruman but by the Men of Nmenor long ago and it is very tall and has many secrets yet it looks not to be a work of craft It cannot be reached save by passing the circle of Isengard and in that circle there is only one gate Late one evening I came to the gate like a great arch in the wall of rock and it was strongly guarded But the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me I rode under the arch and the gate closed silently behind me and suddenly I was afraid though I knew no reason for it But I rode to the foot of Orthanc and came to the stair of Saruman and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber He wore a ring on his finger So you have come Gandalf he said to me gravely but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light as if a cold laughter was in his heart Yes I have come I said I have come for your aid Saruman the White And that title seemed to anger him Have you indeed Gandalf the _Grey_ he scoffed For aid It has seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid one so cunning and so wise wandering about the lands and concerning himself in every business whether it belongs to him or not I looked at him and wondered But if I am not deceived said I things are now moving which will require the union of all our strength That may be so he said but the thought is late in coming to you How long I wonder have you concealed from me the head of the Council a matter of greatest import What brings you now from your lurkingplace in the Shire The Nine have come forth again I answered They have crossed the River So Radagast said to me Radagast the Brown laughed Saruman and he no longer concealed his scorn Radagast the Birdtamer Radagast the Simple Radagast the Fool Yet he had just the wit to play the part that I set him For you have come and that was all the purpose of my message And here you will stay Gandalf the Grey and rest from journeys For I am Saruman the Wise Saruman Ringmaker Saruman of Many Colours I looked then and saw that his robes which had seemed white were not so but were woven of all colours and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered I liked white better I said White he sneered It serves as a beginning White cloth may be dyed The white page can be overwritten and the white light can be broken In which case it is no longer white said I And he that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom You need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for friends said he I have not brought you hither to be instructed by you but to give you a choice He drew himself up then and began to declaim as if he were making a speech long rehearsed The Elder Days are gone The Middle Days are passing The Younger Days are beginning The time of the Elves is over but our time is at hand the world of Men which we must rule But we must have power power to order all things as we will for that good which only the Wise can see And listen Gandalf my old friend and helper he said coming near and speaking now in a softer voice I said we for we it may be if you will join with me A new Power is rising Against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all There is no hope left in Elves or dying Nmenor This then is one choice before you before us We may join with that Power It would be wise Gandalf There is hope that way Its victory is at hand and there will be rich reward for those that aided it As the Power grows its proved friends will also grow and the Wise such as you and I may with patience come at last to direct its courses to control it We can bide our time we can keep our thoughts in our hearts deploring maybe evils done by the way but approving the high and ultimate purpose Knowledge Rule Order all the things that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends There need not be there would not be any real change in our designs only in our means Saruman I said I have heard speeches of this kind before but only in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive the ignorant I cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears He looked at me sidelong and paused a while considering Well I see that this wise course does not commend itself to you he said Not yet Not if some better way can be contrived He came and laid his long hand on my arm And why not Gandalf he whispered Why not The Ruling Ring If we could command that then the Power would pass to us That is in truth why I brought you here For I have many eyes in my service and I believe that you know where this precious thing now lies Is it not so Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire and what is your business there As he said this a lust which he could not conceal shone suddenly in his eyes Saruman I said standing away from him only one hand at a time can wield the One and you know that well so do not trouble to say we But I would not give it nay I would not give even news of it to you now that I learn your mind You were head of the Council but you have unmasked yourself at last Well the choices are it seems to submit to Sauron or to yourself I will take neither Have you others to offer He was cold now and perilous Yes he said I did not expect you to show wisdom even in your own behalf but I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly and so saving yourself much trouble and pain The third choice is to stay here until the end Until what end Until you reveal to me where the One may be found I may find means to persuade you Or until it is found in your despite and the Ruler has time to turn to lighter matters to devise say a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey That may not prove to be one of the lighter matters said I He laughed at me for my words were empty and he knew it They took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of Orthanc in the place where Saruman was accustomed to watch the stars There is no descent save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps and the valley below seems far away I looked on it and saw that whereas it had once been green and fair it was now filled with pits and forges Wolves and orcs were housed in Isengard for Saruman was mustering a great force on his own account in rivalry of Sauron and not in his service yet Over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of Orthanc I stood alone on an island in the clouds and I had no chance of escape and my days were bitter I was pierced with cold and I had but little room in which to pace to and fro brooding on the coming of the Riders to the North That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured apart from the words of Saruman which might be lies Long ere I came to Isengard I had heard tidings by the way that could not be mistaken Fear was ever in my heart for my friends in the Shire but still I had some hope I hoped that Frodo had set forth at once as my letter had urged and that he had reached Rivendell before the deadly pursuit began And both my fear and my hope proved illfounded For my hope was founded on a fat man in Bree and my fear was founded on the cunning of Sauron But fat men who sell ale have many calls to answer and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it But in the circle of Isengard trapped and alone it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the Shire far away I saw you cried Frodo You were walking backwards and forwards The moon shone in your hair Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him It was only a dream said Frodo but it suddenly came back to me I had quite forgotten it It came some time ago after I left the Shire I think Then it was late in coming said Gandalf as you will see I was in an evil plight And those who know me will agree that I have seldom been in such need and do not bear such misfortune well Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spiders treacherous web Yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread At first I feared as Saruman no doubt intended that Radagast had also fallen Yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at our meeting If I had I should never have gone to Isengard or I should have gone more warily So Saruman guessed and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger It would have been useless in any case to try and win over the honest Radagast to treachery He sought me in good faith and so persuaded me That was the undoing of Sarumans plot For Radagast knew no reason why he should not do as I asked and he rode away towards Mirkwood where he had many friends of old And the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide and they saw many things the gathering of wolves and the mustering of Orcs and the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands and they heard news of the escape of Gollum And they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to me So it was that when summer waned there came a night of moon and Gwaihir the Windlord swiftest of the Great Eagles came unlookedfor to Orthanc and he found me standing on the pinnacle Then I spoke to him and he bore me away before Saruman was aware I was far from Isengard ere the wolves and orcs issued from the gate to pursue me How far can you bear me I said to Gwaihir Many leagues said he but not to the ends of the earth I was sent to bear tidings not burdens Then I must have a steed on land I said and a steed surpassingly swift for I have never had such need of haste before Then I will bear you to Edoras where the Lord of Rohan sits in his halls he said for that is not very far off And I was glad for in the Riddermark of Rohan the Rohirrim the Horselords dwell and there are no horses like those that are bred in that great vale between the Misty Mountains and the White Are the Men of Rohan still to be trusted do you think I said to Gwaihir for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith They pay a tribute of horses he answered and send many yearly to Mordor or so it is said but they are not yet under the yoke But if Saruman has become evil as you say then their doom cannot be long delayed He set me down in the land of Rohan ere dawn and now I have lengthened my tale over long The rest must be more brief In Rohan I found evil already at work the lies of Saruman and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings He bade me take a horse and be gone and I chose one much to my liking but little to his I took the best horse in his land and I have never seen the like of him Then he must be a noble beast indeed said Aragorn and it grieves me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that Sauron levies such tribute It was not so when last I was in that land Nor is it now I will swear said Boromir It is a lie that comes from the Enemy I know the Men of Rohan true and valiant our allies dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago The shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands answered Aragorn Saruman has fallen under it Rohan is beset Who knows what you will find there if ever you return Not this at least said Boromir that they will buy their lives with horses They love their horses next to their kin And not without reason for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the North far from the Shadow and their race as that of their masters is descended from the free days of old True indeed said Gandalf And there is one among them that might have been foaled in the morning of the world The horses of the Nine cannot vie with him tireless swift as the flowing wind Shadowfax they called him By day his coat glistens like silver and by night it is like a shade and he passes unseen Light is his footfall Never before had any man mounted him but I took him and I tamed him and so speedily he bore me that I reached the Shire when Frodo was on the Barrowdowns though I set out from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton But fear grew in me as I rode Ever as I came north I heard tidings of the Riders and though I gained on them day by day they were ever before me They had divided their forces I learned some remained on the eastern borders not far from the Greenway and some invaded the Shire from the south I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone but I had words with old Gamgee Many words and few to the point He had much to say about the shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End I cant abide changes said he not at my time of life and least of all changes for the worst Changes for the worst he repeated many times Worst is a bad word I said to him and I hope you do not live to see it But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton less than a week before and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the same evening Then I rode on in fear I came to Buckland and found it in uproar as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick I came to the house at Crickhollow and it was broken open and empty but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodos Then for a while hope left me and I did not wait to gather news or I might have been comforted but I rode on the trail of the Riders It was hard to follow for it went many ways and I was at a loss But it seemed to me that one or two had ridden towards Bree and that way I went for I thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper Butterbur they call him thought I If this delay was his fault I will melt all the butter in him I will roast the old fool over a slow fire He expected no less and when he saw my face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot What did you do to him cried Frodo in alarm He was really very kind to us and did all that he could Gandalf laughed Dont be afraid he said I did not bite and I barked very little So overjoyed was I by the news that I got out of him when he stopped quaking that I embraced the old fellow How it happened I could not then guess but I learned that you had been in Bree the night before and had gone off that morning with Strider Strider I cried shouting for joy Yes sir I am afraid so sir said Butterbur mistaking me He got at them in spite of all that I could do and they took up with him They behaved very queer all the time they were here wilful you might say Ass Fool Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman said I Its the best news I have had since midsummer its worth a gold piece at the least May your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for seven years said I Now I can take a nights rest the first since I have forgotten when So I stayed there that night wondering much what had become of the Riders for only of two had there yet been any news in Bree it seemed But in the night we heard more Five at least came from the west and they threw down the gates and passed through Bree like a howling wind and the Breefolk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world I got up before dawn and went after them I do not know but it seems clear to me that this is what happened Their Captain remained in secret away south of Bree while two rode ahead through the village and four more invaded the Shire But when these were foiled in Bree and at Crickhollow they returned to their Captain with tidings and so left the Road unguarded for a while except by their spies The Captain then sent some eastward straight across country and he himself with the rest rode along the Road in great wrath I galloped to Weathertop like a gale and I reached it before sundown on my second day from Breeand they were there before me They drew away from me for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the Sun was in the sky But they closed round at night and I was besieged on the hilltop in the old ring of Amon Sl I was hard put to it indeed such light and flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the warbeacons of old At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north I could not hope to do more It was impossible to find you Frodo in the wilderness and it would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels So I had to trust to Aragorn But I hoped to draw some of them off and yet reach Rivendell ahead of you and send out help Four Riders did indeed follow me but they turned back after a while and made for the Ford it seems That helped a little for there were only five not nine when your camp was attacked I reached here at last by a long hard road up the Hoarwell and through the Ettenmoors and down from the north It took me nearly fourteen days from Weathertop for I could not ride among the rocks of the trollfells and Shadowfax departed I sent him back to his master but a great friendship has grown between us and if I have need he will come at my call But so it was that I came to Rivendell only three days before the Ring and news of its peril had already been brought herewhich proved well indeed And that Frodo is the end of my account May Elrond and the others forgive the length of it But such a thing has not happened before that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised An account to the Ringbearer of so strange an event was required I think Well the Tale is now told from first to last Here we all are and here is the Ring But we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose What shall we do with it There was silence At last Elrond spoke again This is grievous news concerning Saruman he said for we trusted him and he is deep in all our counsels It is perilous to study too deeply the arts of the Enemy for good or for ill But such falls and betrayals alas have happened before Of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of Frodo was most strange to me I have known few hobbits save Bilbo here and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought him The world has changed much since I last was on the westward roads The Barrowwights we know by many names and of the Old Forest many tales have been told all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern march Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to Dunland west of Isengard In those lands I journeyed once and many things wild and strange I knew But I had forgotten Bombadil if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago and even then was older than the old That was not then his name Iarwain Benadar we called him oldest and fatherless But many another name he has since been given by other folk Forn by the Dwarves Orald by Northern Men and other names beside He is a strange creature but maybe I should have summoned him to our Council He would not have come said Gandalf Could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help asked Erestor It seems that he has a power even over the Ring No I should not put it so said Gandalf Say rather that the Ring has no power over him He is his own master But he cannot alter the Ring itself nor break its power over others And now he is withdrawn into a little land within bounds that he has set though none can see them waiting perhaps for a change of days and he will not step beyond them But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him said Erestor Would he not take the Ring and keep it there for ever harmless No said Gandalf not willingly He might do so if all the free folk of the world begged him but he would not understand the need And if he were given the Ring he would soon forget it or most likely throw it away Such things have no hold on his mind He would be a most unsafe guardian and that alone is answer enough But in any case said Glorfindel to send the Ring to him would only postpone the day of evil He is far away We could not now take it back to him unguessed unmarked by any spy And even if we could soon or late the Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards it Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone I think not I think that in the end if all else is conquered Bombadil will fall Last as he was First and then Night will come I know little of Iarwain save the name said Galdor but Glorfindel I think is right Power to defy our Enemy is not in him unless such power is in the earth itself And yet we see that Sauron can torture and destroy the very hills What power still remains lies with us here in Imladris or with Cirdan at the Havens or in Lrien But have they the strength have we here the strength to withstand the Enemy the coming of Sauron at the last when all else is overthrown I have not the strength said Elrond neither have they Then if the Ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength said Glorfindel two things only remain for us to attempt to send it over the Sea or to destroy it But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess said Elrond And they who dwell beyond the Sea would not receive it for good or ill it belongs to Middleearth it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it Then said Glorfindel let us cast it into the deeps and so make the lies of Saruman come true For it is clear now that even at the Council his feet were already on a crooked path He knew that the Ring was not lost for ever but wished us to think so for he began to lust for it for himself Yet oft in lies truth is hidden in the Sea it would be safe Not safe for ever said Gandalf There are many things in the deep waters and seas and lands may change And it is not our part here to take thought only for a season or for a few lives of Men or for a passing age of the world We should seek a final end of this menace even if we do not hope to make one And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea said Galdor If the return to Iarwain be thought too dangerous then flight to the Sa is now fraught with gravest peril My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us to take the western way when he learns what has befallen He soon will The Nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respite ere they find new steeds and swifter Only the waning might of Gondor stands now between him and a march in power along the coasts into the North and if he comes assailing the White Towers and the Havens hereafter the Elves may have no escape from the lengthening shadows of Middleearth Long yet will that march be delayed said Boromir Gondor wanes you say But Gondor stands and even the end of its strength is still very strong And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine said Galdor And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard Then said Erestor there are but two courses as Glorfindel already has declared to hide the Ring for ever or to unmake it But both are beyond our power Who will read this riddle for us None here can do so said Elrond gravely At least none can foretell what will come to pass if we take this road or that But it seems to me now clear which is the road that we must take The westward road seems easiest Therefore it must be shunned It will be watched Too often the Elves have fled that way Now at this last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen There lies our hope if hope it be To walk into perilto Mordor We must send the Ring to the Fire Silence fell again Frodo even in that fair house looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters felt a dead darkness in his heart Boromir stirred and Frodo looked at him He was fingering his great horn and frowning At length he spoke I do not understand all this he said Saruman is a traitor but did he not have a glimpse of wisdom Why do you speak ever of hiding and destroying Why should we not think that the Great Ring has come into our hands to serve us in the very hour of need Wielding it the Free Lords of the Free may surely defeat the Enemy That is what he most fears I deem The Men of Gondor are valiant and they will never submit but they may be beaten down Valour needs first strength and then a weapon Let the Ring be your weapon if it has such power as you say Take it and go forth to victory Alas no said Elrond We cannot use the Ruling Ring That we now know too well It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone and is altogether evil Its strength Boromir is too great for anyone to wield at will save only those who have already a great power of their own But for them it holds an even deadlier peril The very desire of it corrupts the heart Consider Saruman If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor using his own arts he would then set himself on Saurons throne and yet another Dark Lord would appear And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the Wise For nothing is evil in the beginning Even Sauron was not so I fear to take the Ring to hide it I will not take the Ring to wield it Nor I said Gandalf Boromir looked at them doubtfully but he bowed his head So be it he said Then in Gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have And at the least while the Wise ones guard this Ring we will fight on Mayhap the SwordthatwasBroken may still stem the tide if the hand that wields it has inherited not an heirloom only but the sinews of the Kings of Men Who can tell said Aragorn But we will put it to the test one day May the day not be too long delayed said Boromir For though I do not ask for aid we need it It would comfort us to know that others fought also with all the means that they have Then be comforted said Elrond For there are other powers and realms that you know not and they are hidden from you Anduin the Great flows past many shores ere it comes to Argonath and the Gates of Gondor Still it might be well for all said Glin the Dwarf if all these strengths were joined and the powers of each were used in league Other rings there may be less treacherous that might be used in our need The Seven are lost to us if Balin has not found the ring of Thrr which was the last naught has been heard of it since Thrr perished in Moria Indeed I may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that Balin went away Balin will find no ring in Moria said Gandalf Thrr gave it to Thrin his son but not Thrin to Thorin It was taken with torment from Thrin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur I came too late Ah alas cried Glin When will the day come of our revenge But still there are the Three What of the Three Rings of the Elves Very mighty Rings it is said Do not the Elflords keep them Yet they too were made by the Dark Lord long ago Are they idle I see Elflords here Will they not say The Elves returned no answer Did you not hear me Glin said Elrond The Three were not made by Sauron nor did he ever touch them But of them it is not permitted to speak So much only in this hour of doubt I may now say They are not idle But they were not made as weapons of war or conquest that is not their power Those who made them did not desire strength or domination or hoarded wealth but understanding making and healing to preserve all things unstained These things the Elves of Middleearth have in some measure gained though with sorrow But all that has been wrought by those who wield the Three will turn to their undoing and their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron if he regains the One It would be better if the Three had never been That is his purpose But what then would happen if the Ruling Ring were destroyed as you counsel asked Glin We know not for certain answered Elrond sadly Some hope that the Three Rings which Sauron has never touched would then become free and their rulers might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought But maybe when the One has gone the Three will fail and many fair things will fade and be forgotten That is my belief Yet all the Elves are willing to endure this chance said Glorfindel if by it the power of Sauron may be broken and the fear of his dominion be taken away for ever Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring said Erestor and yet we come no nearer What strength have we for the finding of the Fire in which it was made That is the path of despair Of folly I would say if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me Despair or folly said Gandalf It is not despair for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt We do not It is wisdom to recognize necessity when all other courses have been weighed though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope Well let folly be our cloak a veil before the eyes of the Enemy For he is very wise and weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice But the only measure that he knows is desire desire for power and so he judges all hearts Into his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it that having the Ring we may seek to destroy it If we seek this we shall put him out of reckoning At least for a while said Elrond The road must be trod but it will be very hard And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world small hands do them because they must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere Very well very well Master Elrond said Bilbo suddenly Say no more It is plain enough what you are pointing at Bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair and Bilbo had better finish it or himself I was very comfortable here and getting on with my book If you want to know I am just writing an ending for it I had thought of putting _and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his days_ It is a good ending and none the worse for having been used before Now I shall have to alter that it does not look like coming true and anyway there will evidently have to be several more chapters if I live to write them It is a frightful nuisance When ought I to start Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo but the laughter died on his lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave respect Only Glin smiled but his smile came from old memories Of course my dear Bilbo said Gandalf If you had really started this affair you might be expected to finish it But you know well enough now that _starting_ is too great a claim for any and that only a small part is played in great deeds by any hero You need not bow Though the word was meant and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer But one beyond your strength Bilbo You cannot take this thing back It has passed on If you need my advice any longer I should say that your part is ended unless as a recorder Finish your book and leave the ending unaltered There is still hope for it But get ready to write a sequel when they come back Bilbo laughed I have never known you give me pleasant advice before he said As all your unpleasant advice has been good I wonder if this advice is not bad Still I dont suppose I have the strength or luck left to deal with the Ring It has grown and I have not But tell me what do you mean by _they_ The messengers who are sent with the Ring Exactly And who are they to be That seems to me what this Council has to decide and all that it has to decide Elves may thrive on speech alone and Dwarves endure great weariness but I am only an old hobbit and I miss my meal at noon Cant you think of some names now Or put it off till after dinner No one answered The noonbell rang Still no one spoke Frodo glanced at all the faces but they were not turned to him All the Council sat with downcast eyes as if in deep thought A great dread fell on him as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by Bilbos side in Rivendell filled all his heart At last with an effort he spoke and wondered to hear his own words as if some other will was using his small voice I will take the Ring he said though I do not know the way Elrond raised his eyes and looked at him and Frodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance If I understand aright all that I have heard he said I think that this task is appointed for you Frodo and that if you do not find a way no one will This is the hour of the Shirefolk when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the Great Who of all the Wise could have foreseen it Or if they are wise why should they expect to know it until the hour has struck But it is a heavy burden So heavy that none could lay it on another I do not lay it on you But if you take it freely I will say that your choice is right and though all the mighty elffriends of old Hador and Hrin and Trin and Beren himself were assembled together your seat should be among them But you wont send him off alone surely Master cried Sam unable to contain himself any longer and jumping up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor No indeed said Elrond turning towards him with a smile You at least shall go with him It is hardly possible to separate you from him even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not Sam sat down blushing and muttering A nice pickle we have landed ourselves in Mr Frodo he said shaking his head _Chapter 3_ The Ring Goes South Later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in Bilbos room Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the Council and had been chosen as Frodos companion Its most unfair said Pippin Instead of throwing him out and clapping him in chains Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek Rewards said Frodo I cant imagine a more severe punishment You are not thinking what you are saying condemned to go on this hopeless journey a reward Yesterday I dreamed that my task was done and I could rest here a long while perhaps for good I dont wonder said Merry and I wish you could But we are envying Sam not you If you have to go then it will be a punishment for any of us to be left behind even in Rivendell We have come a long way with you and been through some stiff times We want to go on Thats what I meant said Pippin We hobbits ought to stick together and we will I shall go unless they chain me up There must be someone with intelligence in the party Then you certainly will not be chosen Peregrin Took said Gandalf looking in through the window which was near the ground But you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily Nothing is decided yet Nothing decided cried Pippin Then what were you all doing You were shut up for hours Talking said Bilbo There was a deal of talk and everyone had an eyeopener Even old Gandalf I think Legolass bit of news about Gollum caught even him on the hop though he passed it off You were wrong said Gandalf You were inattentive I had already heard of it from Gwaihir If you want to know the only real eyeopeners as you put it were you and Frodo and I was the only one that was not surprised Well anyway said Bilbo nothing was decided beyond choosing poor Frodo and Sam I was afraid all the time that it might come to that if I was let off But if you ask me Elrond will send out a fair number when the reports come in Have they started yet Gandalf Yes said the wizard Some of the scouts have been sent out already More will go tomorrow Elrond is sending Elves and they will get in touch with the Rangers and maybe with Thranduils folk in Mirkwood And Aragorn has gone with Elronds sons We shall have to scour the lands all round for many long leagues before any move is made So cheer up Frodo You will probably make quite a long stay here Ah said Sam gloomily Well just wait long enough for winter to come That cant be helped said Bilbo Its your fault partly Frodo my lad insisting on waiting for my birthday A funny way of honouring it I cant help thinking Not the day I should have chosen for letting the SBs into Bag End But there it is you cant wait now fill spring and you cant go till the reports come back When winter first begins to bite and stones crack in the frosty night when pools are black and trees are bare tis evil in the Wild to fare But that I am afraid will be just your luck I am afraid it will said Gandalf We cant start until we have found out about the Riders I thought they were all destroyed in the flood said Merry You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that said Gandalf The power of their master is in them and they stand or fall by him We hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked and so made for a while less dangerous but we must find out for certain In the meantime you should try and forget your troubles Frodo I do not know if I can do anything to help you but I will whisper this in your ears Someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party He was right I think I shall come with you So great was Frodos delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the windowsill where he had been sitting and took off his hat and bowed I only said _I think I shall come_ Do not count on anything yet In this matter Elrond will have much to say and your friend the Strider Which reminds me I want to see Elrond I must be off How long do you think I shall have here said Frodo to Bilbo when Gandalf had gone Oh I dont know I cant count days in Rivendell said Bilbo But quite long I should think We can have many a good talk What about helping me with my book and making a start on the next Have you thought of an ending Yes several and all are dark and unpleasant said Frodo Oh that wont do said Bilbo Books ought to have good endings How would this do _and they all settled down and lived together happily ever after_ It will do well if it ever comes to that said Frodo Ah said Sam And where will they live Thats what I often wonder For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the perils that lay ahead but such was the virtue of the land of Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds The future good or ill was not forgotten but ceased to have any power over the present Health and hope grew strong in them and they were content with each good day as it came taking pleasure in every meal and in every word and song So the days slipped away as each morning dawned bright and fair and each evening followed cool and clear But autumn was waning fast slowly the golden light faded to pale silver and the lingering leaves fell from the naked trees A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the east The Hunters Moon waxed round in the night sky and put to flight all the lesser stars But low in the South one star shone red Every night as the Moon waned again it shone brighter and brighter Frodo could see it from his window deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley The hobbits had been nearly two months in the House of Elrond and November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn and December was passing when the scouts began to return Some had gone north beyond the springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors and others had gone west and with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the Greyflood as far as Tharbad where the old North Road crossed the river by a ruined town Many had gone east and south and some of these had crossed the Mountains and entered Mirkwood while others had climbed the pass at the source of the Gladden River and had come down into Wilderland and over the Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at Rhosgobel Radagast was not there and they had returned over the high pass that was called the Dimrill Stair The sons of Elrond Elladan and Elrohir were the last to return they had made a great journey passing down the Silverlode into a strange country but of their errand they would not speak to any save to Elrond In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the Riders or other servants of the Enemy Even from the Eagles of the Misty Mountains they had learned no fresh news Nothing had been seen or heard of Gollum but the wild wolves were still gathering and were hunting again far up the Great River Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned in the flooded Ford On the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered the bodies of five more and also a long black cloak slashed and tattered Of the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen and nowhere was their presence to be felt It seemed that they had vanished from the North Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least said Gandalf It is rash to be too sure yet I think that we may hope now that the Ringwraiths were scattered and have been obliged to return as best they could to their Master in Mordor empty and shapeless If that is so it will be some time before they can begin the hunt again Of course the Enemy has other servants but they will have to journey all the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can pick up our trail And if we are careful that will be hard to find But we must delay no longer Elrond summoned the hobbits to him He looked gravely at Frodo The time has come he said If the Ring is to set out it must go soon But those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or force They must pass into the domain of the Enemy far from aid Do you still hold to your word Frodo that you will be the Ringbearer I do said Frodo I will go with Sam Then I cannot help you much not even with counsel said Elrond I can foresee very little of your road and how your task is to be achieved I do not know The Shadow has crept now to the feet of the Mountains and draws nigh even to the borders of Greyflood and under the Shadow all is dark to me You will meet many foes some open and some disguised and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for it I will send out messages such as I can contrive to those whom I know in the wide world but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry or come no quicker than you yourself And I will choose you companions to go with you as far as they will or fortune allows The number must be few since your hope is in speed and secrecy Had I a host of Elves in armour of the Elder Days it would avail little save to arouse the power of Mordor The Company of the Ring shall be Nine and the Nine Walkers shall be set against the Nine Riders that are evil With you and your faithful servant Gandalf will go for this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his labours For the rest they shall represent the other Free Peoples of the World Elves Dwarves and Men Legolas shall be for the Elves and Gimli son of Glin for the Dwarves They are willing to go at least to the passes of the Mountains and maybe beyond For men you shall have Aragorn son of Arathorn for the Ring of Isildur concerns him closely Strider said Frodo Yes he said with a smile I ask leave once again to be your companion Frodo I would have begged you to come said Frodo only I thought you were going to Minas Tirith with Boromir I am said Aragorn And the SwordthatwasBroken shall be reforged ere I set out to war But your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of miles Therefore Boromir will also be in the Company He is a valiant man There remain two more to be found said Elrond These I will consider Of my household I may find some that it seems good to me to send But that will leave no place for us cried Pippin in dismay We dont want to be left behind We want to go with Frodo That is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies ahead said Elrond Neither does Frodo said Gandalf unexpectedly supporting Pippin Nor do any of us see clearly It is true that if these hobbits understood the danger they would not dare to go But they would still wish to go or wish that they dared and be shamed and unhappy I think Elrond that in this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom Even if you chose for us an elflord such as Glorfindel he could not storm the Dark Tower nor open the road to the Fire by the power that is in him You speak gravely said Elrond but I am in doubt The Shire I forebode is not free now from peril and these two I had thought to send back there as messengers to do what they could according to the fashion of their country to warn the people of their danger In any case I judge that the younger of these two Peregrin Took should remain My heart is against his going Then Master Elrond you will have to lock me in prison or send me home tied in a sack said Pippin For otherwise I shall follow the Company Let it be so then You shall go said Elrond and he sighed Now the tale of Nine is filled In seven days the Company must depart The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths and on its blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the rayed Sun and about them was written many runes for Aragorn son of Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again the light of the sun shone redly in it and the light of the moon shone cold and its edge was hard and keen And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it Andril Flame of the West Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond Sometimes Frodo was with them but he was content to lean on their guidance and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lthien and the winning of the Great Jewel but in the day while Merry and Pippin were out and about Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room Then Bilbo would read passages from his book which still seemed very incomplete or scraps of his verses or would take notes of Frodos adventures On the morning of the last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo and the old hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box He lifted the lid and fumbled inside Here is your sword he said But it was broken you know I took it to keep it safe but Ive forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it No time now So I thought perhaps you would care to have this dont you know He took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard Then he drew it and its polished and welltended blade glittered suddenly cold and bright This is Sting he said and thrust it with little effort deep into a wooden beam Take it if you like I shant want it again I expect Frodo accepted it gratefully Also there is this said Bilbo bringing out a parcel which seemed to be rather heavy for its size He unwound several folds of old cloth and held up a small shirt of mail It was closewoven of many rings as supple almost as linen cold as ice and harder than steel It shone like moonlit silver and was studded with white gems With it was a belt of pearl and crystal Its a pretty thing isnt it said Bilbo moving it in the light And useful It is my dwarfmail that Thorin gave me I got it back from Michel Delving before I started and packed it with my luggage I brought all the mementoes of my Journey away with me except the Ring But I did not expect to use this and I dont need it now except to look at sometimes You hardly feel any weight when you put it on I should look well I dont think I should look right in it said Frodo Just what I said myself said Bilbo But never mind about looks You can wear it under your outer clothes Come on You must share this secret with me Dont tell anybody else But I should feel happier if I knew you were wearing it I have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the Black Riders he ended in a low voice Very well I will take it said Frodo Bilbo put it on him and fastened Sting upon the glittering belt and then Frodo put over the top his old weatherstained breeches tunic and jacket Just a plain hobbit you look said Bilbo But there is more about you now than appears on the surface Good luck to you He turned away and looked out of the window trying to hum a tune I cannot thank you as I should Bilbo for this and for all our past kindnesses said Frodo Dont try said the old hobbit turning round and slapping him on the back Ow he cried You are too hard now to slap But there you are Hobbits must stick together and especially Bagginses All I ask in return is take as much care of yourself as you can and bring back all the news you can and any old songs and tales you can come by Ill do my best to finish my book before you return I should like to write the second book if I am spared He broke off and turned to the window again singing softly I sit beside the fire and think of all that I have seen of meadowflowers and butterflies in summers that have been Of yellow leaves and gossamer in autumns that there were with morning mist and silver sun and wind upon my hair I sit beside the fire and think of how the world will be when winter comes without a spring that I shall ever see For still there are so many things that I have never seen in every wood in every spring there is a different green I sit beside the fire and think of people long ago and people who will see a world that I shall never know But all the while I sit and think of times there were before I listen for returning feet and voices at the door It was a cold grey day near the end of December The East Wind was streaming through the bare branches of the trees and seething in the dark pines on the hills Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead dark and low As the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the Company made ready to set out They were to start at dusk for Elrond counselled them to journey under cover of night as often as they could until they were far from Rivendell You should fear the many eyes of the servants of Sauron he said I do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the Riders has already reached him and he will be filled with wrath Soon now his spies on foot and wing will be abroad in the northern lands Even of the sky above you must beware as you go on your way The Company took little gear of war for their hope was in secrecy not in battle Aragorn had Andril but no other weapon and he went forth clad only in rusty green and brown as a Ranger of the wilderness Boromir had a long sword in fashion like Andril but of less lineage and he bore also a shield and his warhorn Loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills he said and then let all the foes of Gondor flee Putting it to his lips he blew a blast and the echoes leapt from rock to rock and all that heard that voice in Rivendell sprang to their feet Slow should you be to wind that horn again Boromir said Elrond until you stand once more on the borders of your land and dire need is on you Maybe said Boromir But always I have let my horn cry at setting forth and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows I will not go forth as a thief in the night Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steelrings for dwarves make light of burdens and in his belt was a broadbladed axe Legolas had a bow and a quiver and at his belt a long white knife The younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow but Frodo took only Sting and his mailcoat as Bilbo wished remained hidden Gandalf bore his staff but girt at his side was the elvensword Glamdring the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur Spare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were laden on a pony none other than the poor beast that they had brought from Bree he stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth It was Sam who had insisted on choosing him declaring that Bill as he called him would pine if he did not come That animal can nearly talk he said and would talk if he stayed here much longer He gave me a look as plain as Mr Pippin could speak it if you dont let me go with you Sam Ill follow on my own So Bill was going as the beast of burden yet he was the only member of the Company that did not seem depressed Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire and they were only waiting now for Gandalf who had not yet come out of the house A gleam of firelight came from the open doors and soft lights were glowing in many windows Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside Frodo Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees only Elrond knew fully what this hour meant to him The others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness Sam was standing by the pony sucking his teeth and staring moodily into the gloom where the river roared stonily below his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb Bill my lad he said you oughtnt to have took up with us You could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes Bill swished his tail and said nothing Sam eased the pack on his shoulders and went over anxiously in his mind all the things that he had stowed in it wondering if he had forgotten anything his chief treasure his cooking gear and the little box of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could a good supply of pipeweed but not near enough Ill warrant flint and tinder woollen hose linen various small belongings of his masters that Frodo had forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called for He went through them all Rope he muttered No rope And only last night you said to yourself Sam what about a bit of rope Youll want it if you havent got it Well Ill want it I cant get it now At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf and he called the Company to him This is my last word he said in a low voice The Ringbearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom On him alone is any charge laid neither to cast away the Ring nor to deliver it to any servant of the Enemy nor indeed to let any handle it save members of the Company and the Council and only then in gravest need The others go with him as free companions to help him on his way You may tarry or come back or turn aside into other paths as chance allows The further you go the less easy will it be to withdraw yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further than you will For you do not yet know the strength of your hearts and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens said Gimli Maybe said Elrond but let him not vow to walk in the dark who has not seen the nightfall Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart said Gimli Or break it said Elrond Look not too far ahead But go now with good hearts Farewell and may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you May the stars shine upon your faces Good good luck cried Bilbo stuttering with the cold I dont suppose you will be able to keep a diary Frodo my lad but I shall expect a full account when you get back And dont be too long Farewell Many others of Elronds household stood in the shadows and watched them go bidding them farewell with soft voices There was no laughter and no song or music At last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell and they came at length to the high moor where the wind hissed through the heather Then with one glance at the Last Homely House twinkling below them they strode away far into the night At the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands Their purpose was to hold this course west of the Mountains for many miles and days The country was much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in Wilderland on the other side of the range and their going would be slow but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes The spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country and the paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell Gandalf walked in front and with him went Aragorn who knew this land even in the dark The others were in file behind and Legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard The first part of their journey was hard and dreary and Frodo remembered little of it save the wind For many sunless days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east and no garment seemed able to keep out its searching fingers Though the Company was well clad they seldom felt warm either moving or at rest They slept uneasily during the middle of the day in some hollow of the land or hidden under the tangled thornbushes that grew in thickets in many places In the late afternoon they were roused by the watch and took their chief meal cold and cheerless as a rule for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire In the evening they went on again always as nearly southward as they could find a way At first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and stumbled until they were weary they were creeping forward like snails and getting nowhere Each day the land looked much the same as it had the day before Yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer South of Rivendell they rose ever higher and bent westwards and about the feet of the main range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills and deep valleys filled with turbulent waters Paths were few and winding and led them often only to the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous swamps They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed The wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south The swiftflowing clouds lifted and melted away and the sun came out pale and bright There came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling nightmarch The travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient hollytrees whose greygreen trunks seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills Their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking At the left of this high range rose three peaks the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow its great bare northern precipice was still largely in the shadow but where the sunlight slanted upon it it glowed red Gandalf stood at Frodos side and looked out under his hand We have done well he said We have reached the borders of the country that Men call Hollin many Elves lived here in happier days when Eregion was its name Fiveandforty leagues as the crow flies we have come though many long miles further our feet have walked The land and the weather will be milder now but perhaps all the more dangerous Dangerous or not a real sunrise is mighty welcome said Frodo throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face But the mountains are ahead of us said Pippin We must have turned eastwards in the night No said Gandalf But you see further ahead in the clear light Beyond those peaks the range bends round southwest There are many maps in Elronds house but I suppose you never thought to look at them Yes I did sometimes said Pippin but I dont remember them Frodo has a better head for that sort of thing I need no map said Gimli who had come up with Legolas and was gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes There is the land where our fathers worked of old and we have wrought the image of those mountains into many works of metal and of stone and into many songs and tales They stand tall in our dreams Baraz Zirak Shathr Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life but I know them and their names for under them lies Khazaddm the Dwarrowdelf that is now called the Black Pit Moria in the Elvish tongue Yonder stands Barazinbar the Redhorn cruel Caradhras and beyond him are Silvertine and Cloudyhead Celebdil the White and Fanuidhol the Grey that we call Zirakzigil and Bundushathr There the Misty Mountains divide and between their arms lies the deepshadowed valley which we cannot forget Azanulbizar the Dimrill Dale which the Elves call Nanduhirion It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making said Gandalf If we climb the pass that is called the Redhorn Gate under the far side of Caradhras we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the Dwarves There lies the Mirrormere and there the River Silverlode rises in its icy springs Dark is the water of Kheledzram said Gimli and cold are the springs of Kibilnla My heart trembles at the thought that I may see them soon May you have joy of the sight my good dwarf l said Gandalf But whatever you may do we at least cannot stay in that valley We must go down the Silverlode into the secret woods and so to the Great River and then He paused Yes and where then asked Merry To the end of the journey in the end said Gandalf We cannot look too far ahead Let us be glad that the first stage is safely over I think we will rest here not only today but tonight as well There is a wholesome air about Hollin Much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets the Elves if once they dwelt there That is true said Legolas But the Elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silvan folk and the trees and the grass do not now remember them Only I hear the stones lament them _deep they delved us fair they wrought us high they builded us but they are gone_ They are gone They sought the Havens long ago That morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly and their supperbreakfast was merrier than it had been since they set out They did not hurry to bed afterwards for they expected to have all the night to sleep in and they did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day Only Aragorn was silent and restless After a while he left the Company and wandered on to the ridge there he stood in the shadow of a tree looking out southwards and westwards with his head posed as if he was listening Then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked down at the others laughing and talking What is the matter Strider Merry called up What are you looking for Do you miss the East Wind No indeed he answered But I miss something I have been in the country of Hollin in many seasons No folk dwell here now but many other creatures live here at all times especially birds Yet now all things but you are silent I can feel it There is no sound for miles about us and your voices seem to make the ground echo I do not understand it Gandalf looked up with sudden interest But what do you guess is the reason he asked Is there more in it than surprise at seeing four hobbits not to mention the rest of us where people are so seldom seen or heard I hope that is it answered Aragorn But I have a sense of watchfulness and of fear that I have never had here before Then we must be more careful said Gandalf If you bring a Ranger with you it is well to pay attention to him especially if the Ranger is Aragorn We must stop talking aloud rest quietly and set the watch It was Sams turn that day to take the first watch but Aragorn joined him The others fell asleep Then the silence grew until even Sam felt it The breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard The swish of the ponys tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises Sam could hear his own joints creaking if he stirred Dead silence was around him and over all hung a clear blue sky as the Sun rode up from the East Away in the South a dark patch appeared and grew and drove north like flying smoke in the wind Whats that Strider It dont look like a cloud said Sam in a whisper to Aragorn He made no answer he was gazing intently at the sky but before long Sam could see for himself what was approaching Flocks of birds flying at great speed were wheeling and circling and traversing all the land as if they were searching for something and they were steadily drawing nearer Lie flat and still hissed Aragorn pulling Sam down into the shade of a hollybush for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main host and came flying low straight towards the ridge Sam thought they were a kind of crow of large size As they passed overhead in so dense a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below one harsh croak was heard Not until they had dwindled into the distance north and west and the sky was again clear would Aragorn rise Then he sprang up and went and wakened Gandalf Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the Mountains and the Greyflood he said and they have passed over Hollin They are not natives here they are _crebain_ out of Fangorn and Dunland I do not know what they are about possibly there is some trouble away south from which they are fleeing but I think they are spying out the land I have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky I think we ought to move again this evening Hollin is no longer wholesome for us it is being watched And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate said Gandalf and how we can get over that without being seen I cannot imagine But we will think of that when we must As for moving as soon as it is dark I am afraid that you are right Luckily our fire made little smoke and had burned low before the _crebain_ came said Aragorn It must be put out and not lit again Well if that isnt a plague and a nuisance said Pippin The news no fire and a move again by night had been broken to him as soon as he woke in the late afternoon All because of a pack of crows I had looked forward to a real good meal tonight something hot Well you can go on looking forward said Gandalf There may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort and warmer feet However we are certain of one thing at any rate it will get warmer as we get south Too warm I shouldnt wonder muttered Sam to Frodo But Im beginning to think its time we got a sight of that Fiery Mountain and saw the end of the Road so to speak I thought at first that this here Redhorn or whatever its name is might be it till Gimli spoke his piece A fair jawcracker dwarflanguage must be Maps conveyed nothing to Sams mind and all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning All that day the Company remained in hiding The dark birds passed over now and again but as the westering Sun grew red they disappeared southwards At dusk the Company set out and turning now half east they steered their course towards Caradhras which far away still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished Sun One by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path It looked to Frodo like the remains of an ancient road that had once been broad and well planned from Hollin to the mountainpass The Moon now at the full rose over the mountains and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black Many of them looked to have been worked by hands though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak barren land It was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn and the moon was low Frodo looked up at the sky Suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the high stars as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again He shivered Did you see anything pass over he whispered to Gandalf who was just ahead No but I felt it whatever it was he answered It may be nothing only a wisp of thin cloud It was moving fast then muttered Aragorn and not with the wind Nothing further happened that night The next morning dawned even brighter than before But the air was chill again already the wind was turning back towards the east For two more nights they marched on climbing steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills and the mountains towered up nearer and nearer On the third morning Caradhras rose before them a mighty peak tipped with snow like silver but with sheer naked sides dull red as if stained with blood There was a black look in the sky and the sun was wan The wind had gone now round to the northeast Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back Winter deepens behind us he said quietly to Aragorn The heights away north are whiter than they were snow is lying far down their shoulders Tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the Redhorn Gate We may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path and waylaid by some evil but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any What do you think of your course now Aragorn Frodo overheard these words and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long before He listened anxiously I think no good of our course from beginning to end as you know well Gandalf answered Aragorn And perils known and unknown will grow as we go on But we must go on and it is no good our delaying the passage of the mountains Further south there are no passes till one comes to the Gap of Rohan I do not trust that way since your news of Saruman Who knows which side now the marshals of the Horselords serve Who knows indeed said Gandalf But there is another way and not by the pass of Caradhras the dark and secret way that we have spoken of But let us not speak of it again Not yet Say nothing to the others I beg not until it is plain that there is no other way We must decide before we go further answered Gandalf Then let us weigh the matter in our minds while the others rest and sleep said Aragorn In the late afternoon while the others were finishing their breakfast Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras Its sides were now dark and sullen and its head was in grey cloud Frodo watched them wondering which way the debate would go When they returned to the Company Gandalf spoke and then he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high pass He was relieved He could not guess what was the other dark and secret way but the very mention of it had seemed to fill Aragorn with dismay and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned From signs that we have seen lately said Gandalf I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be watched and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind Snow may come We must go with all the speed that we can Even so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the pass Dark will come early this evening We must leave as soon as you can get ready I will add a word of advice if I may said Boromir I was born under the shadow of the White Mountains and know something of journeys in the high places We shall meet bitter cold if no worse before we come down on the other side It will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen to death When we leave here where there are still a few trees and bushes each of us should carry a faggot of wood as large as he can bear And Bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad said Sam The pony looked at him mournfully Very well said Gandalf But we must not use the wood not unless it is a choice between fire and death The Company set out again with good speed at first but soon their way became steep and difficult The twisting and climbing road had in many places almost disappeared and was blocked with many fallen stones The night grew deadly dark under great clouds A bitter wind swirled among the rocks By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains The narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left above which the grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom on the right was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top Frodo felt a soft touch on his face He put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve They went on But before long the snow was falling fast filling all the air and swirling into Frodos eyes The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen I dont like this at all panted Sam just behind Snows all right on a fine morning but I like to be in bed while its falling I wish this lot would go off to Hobbiton Folk might welcome it there Except on the high moors of the Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire and was regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun No living hobbit save Bilbo could remember the Fell Winter of 1311 when the white wolves invaded the Shire over the frozen Brandywine Gandalf halted Snow was thick on his hood and shoulders it was already ankledeep about his boots This is what I feared he said What do you say now Aragorn That I feared it too Aragorn answered but less than other things I knew the risk of snow though it seldom falls heavily so far south save high up in the mountains But we are not high yet we are still far down where the paths are usually open all the winter I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy said Boromir They say in my land that he can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that stand upon the borders of Mordor He has strange powers and many allies His arm has grown long indeed said Gimli if he can draw snow down from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away His arm has grown long said Gandalf While they were halted the wind died down and the snow slackened until it almost ceased They tramped on again But they had not gone more than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury The wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzard Soon even Boromir found it hard to keep going The hobbits bent nearly double toiled along behind the taller folk but it was plain that they could not go much further if the snow continued Frodos feet felt like lead Pippin was dragging behind Even Gimli as stout as any dwarf could be was grumbling as he trudged The Company halted suddenly as if they had come to an agreement without any words being spoken They heard eerie noises in the darkness round them It may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall but the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter Stones began to fall from the mountainside whistling over their heads or crashing on the path beside them Every now and again they heard a dull rumble as a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights above We cannot go further tonight said Boromir Let those call it the wind who will there are fell voices on the air and these stones are aimed at us I do call it the wind said Aragorn But that does not make what you say untrue There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs and yet are not in league with Sauron but have purposes of their own Some have been in this world longer than he Caradhras was called the Cruel and had an ill name said Gimli long years ago when rumour of Sauron had not been heard in these lands It matters little who is the enemy if we cannot beat off his attack said Gandalf But what can we do cried Pippin miserably He was leaning on Merry and Frodo and he was shivering Either stop where we are or go back said Gandalf It is no good going on Only a little higher if I remember rightly this path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard slope We should have no shelter there from snow or stones or anything else And it is no good going back while the storm holds said Aragorn We have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this cliffwall we are under now Shelter muttered Sam If this is shelter then one wall and no roof make a house The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could It faced southwards and near the bottom it leaned out a little so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stones But eddying blasts swirled round them from every side and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds They huddled together with their backs to the wall Bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits and screened them a little but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely buried A great sleepiness came over Frodo he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream He thought a fire was heating his toes and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbos voice speaking_ I dont think much of your diary_ he said _Snowstorms on January the twelfth there was no need to come back to report that_ _But I wanted rest and sleep Bilbo_ Frodo answered with an effort when he felt himself shaken and he came back painfully to wakefulness Boromir had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow This will be the death of the halflings Gandalf said Boromir It is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads We must do something to save ourselves Give them this said Gandalf searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask Just a mouthful each for all of us It is very precious It is _miruvor_ the cordial of Imladris Elrond gave it to me at our parting Pass it round As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs The others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour But the snow did not relent It whirled about them thicker than ever and the wind blew louder What do you say to fire asked Boromir suddenly The choice seems near now between fire and death Gandalf Doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us but that will not help us You may make a fire if you can answered Gandalf If there are any watchers that can endure this storm then they can see us fire or no But though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir it passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment and then with a word of command_ naur an edraith ammen_ he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it At once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out and the wood flared and sputtered If there are any to see then I at least am revealed to them he said I have written _Gandalf is here_ in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes Their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire The wood burned merrily and though all round it the snow hissed and pools of slush crept under their feet they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze There they stood stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames A red light was on their tired and anxious faces behind them the night was like a black wall But the wood was burning fast and the snow still fell The fire burned low and the last faggot was thrown on The night is getting old said Aragorn The dawn is not far off If any dawn can pierce these clouds said Gimli Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness The snow is growing less he said and the wind is quieter Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire but for a long time he could see no sign of their slackening Then suddenly as sleep was beginning to creep over him again he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer Very slowly a dim light began to grow At last the snow stopped altogether As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world Below their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was altogether lost but the heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow Gimli looked up and shook his head Caradhras has not forgiven us he said He has more snow yet to fling at us if we go on The sooner we go back and down the better To this all agreed but their retreat was now difficult It might well prove impossible Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep higher than the heads of the hobbits in places it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame he might melt a path for you said Legolas The storm had troubled him little and he alone of the Company remained still light of heart If Elves could fly over mountains they might fetch the Sun to save us answered Gandalf But I must have something to work on I cannot burn snow Well said Boromir when heads are at a loss bodies must serve as we say in my country The strongest of us must seek a way See Though all is now snowclad our path as we came up turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder It was there that the snow first began to burden us If we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier beyond It is no more than a furlong off I guess Then let us force a path thither you and I said Aragorn Aragorn was the tallest of the Company but Boromir little less in height was broader and heavier in build He led the way and Aragorn followed him Slowly they moved off and were soon toiling heavily In places the snow was breasthigh and often Boromir seemed to bc swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than walking Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips and then he turned to the others The strongest must seek a way say you But I say let a ploughman plough but choose an otter for swimming and for running light over grass and leaf or over snowan Elf With that he sprang forth nimbly and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time though he had long known it that the Elf had no boots but wore only light shoes as he always did and his feet made little imprint in the snow Farewell he said to Gandalf I go to find the Sun Then swift as a runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking the toiling men with a wave of his hand he passed them and sped into the distance and vanished round the rocky turn The others waited huddled together watching until Boromir and Aragorn dwindled into black specks in the whiteness At length they too passed from sight The time dragged on The clouds lowered and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again An hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer and then at last they saw Legolas coming back At the same time Boromir and Aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope Well cried Legolas as he ran up I have not brought the Sun She is walking in the blue fields of the South and a little wreath of snow on this Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all But I have brought back a gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet There is the greatest winddrift of all just beyond the turn and there our Strong Men were almost buried They despaired until I returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall And on the other side the snow suddenly grows less while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbits toes Ah it is as I said growled Gimli It was no ordinary storm It is the ill will of Caradhras He does not love Elves and Dwarves and that drift was laid to cut off our escape But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you said Boromir who came up at that moment And doughty Men too if I may say it though lesser men with spades might have served you better Still we have thrust a lane through the drift and for that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as Elves But how are we to get down there even if you have cut through the drift said Pippin voicing the thought of all the hobbits Have hope said Boromir I am weary but I still have some strength left and Aragorn too We will bear the little folk The others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us Come Master Peregrin I will begin with you He lifted up the hobbit Cling to my back I shall need my arms he said and strode forward Aragorn with Merry came behind Pippin marvelled at his strength seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other tool than his great limbs Even now burdened as he was he was widening the track for those who followed thrusting the snow aside as he went They came at length to the great drift It was flung across the mountainpath like a sheer and sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with knives reared up more than twice the height of Boromir but through the middle a passage had been beaten rising and falling like a bridge On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down and there they waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam Behind in the narrow but now welltrodden track came Gandalf leading Bill with Gimli perched among the baggage Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo They passed through the lane but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow The spray of it half blinded the Company as they crouched against the cliff and when the air cleared again they saw that the path was blocked behind them Enough enough cried Gimli We are departing as quickly as we may And indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be expended as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten off and would not dare to return The threat of snow lifted the clouds began to break and the light grew broader As Legolas had reported they found that the snow became steadily more shallow as they went down so that even the hobbits could trudge along Soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before The morning was now far advanced From the high place they looked back westwards over the lower lands Far away in the tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to climb the pass Frodos legs ached He was chilled to the bone and hungry and his head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill Black specks swam before his eyes He rubbed them but the black specks remained In the distance below him but still high above the lower foothills dark dots were circling in the air The birds again said Aragorn pointing down That cannot be helped now said Gandalf Whether they are good or evil or have nothing to do with us at all we must go down at once Not even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another nightfall A cold wind flowed down behind them as they turned their backs on the Redhorn Gate and stumbled wearily down the slope Caradhras had defeated them _Chapter 4_ A Journey in the Dark It was evening and the grey light was again waning fast when they halted for the night They were very weary The mountains were veiled in deepening dusk and the wind was cold Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell When they had eaten some food he called a council We cannot of course go on again tonight he said The attack on the Redhorn Gate has tired us out and we must rest here for a while And then where are we to go asked Frodo We still have our journey and our errand before us answered Gandalf We have no choice but to go on or to return to Rivendell Pippins face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to Rivendell Merry and Sam looked up hopefully But Aragorn and Boromir made no sign Frodo looked troubled I wish I was back there he said But how can I return without shame unless there is indeed no other way and we are already defeated You are right Frodo said Gandalf to go back is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come If we go back now then the Ring must remain there we shall not be able to set out again Then sooner or later Rivendell will be besieged and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies but they are only shadows yet of the power and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their masters hand again Then we must go on if there is a way said Frodo with a sigh Sam sank back into gloom There is a way that we may attempt said Gandalf I thought from the beginning when first I considered this journey that we should try it But it is not a pleasant way and I have not spoken of it to the Company before Aragorn was against it until the pass over the mountains had at least been tried If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate then it must be evil indeed said Merry But you had better tell us about it and let us know the worst at once The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria said Gandalf Only Gimli lifted up his head a smouldering fire was in his eyes On all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name Even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague fear The road may lead to Moria but how can we hope that it will lead through Moria said Aragorn darkly It is a name of ill omen said Boromir Nor do I see the need to go there If we cannot cross the mountains let us journey southwards until we come to the Gap of Rohan where men are friendly to my people taking the road that I followed on my way hither Or we might pass by and cross the Isen into Langstrand and Lebennin and so come to Gondor from the regions nigh to the sea Things have changed since you came north Boromir answered Gandalf Did you not hear what I told you of Saruman With him I may have business of my own ere all is over But the Ring must not come near Isengard if that can by any means be prevented The Gap of Rohan is closed to us while we go with the Bearer As for the longer road we cannot afford the time We might spend a year in such a journey and we should pass through many lands that are empty and harbourless Yet they would not be safe The watchful eyes both of Saruman and of the Enemy are on them When you came north Boromir you were in the Enemys eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter of small concern to him his mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring But you return now as a member of the Rings Company and you are in peril as long as you remain with us The danger will increase with every league that we go south under the naked sky Since our open attempt on the mountainpass our plight has become more desperate I fear I see now little hope if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while and cover our trail Therefore I advise that we should go neither over the mountains nor round them but under them That is a road at any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take We do not know what he expects said Boromir He may watch all roads likely and unlikely In that case to enter Moria would be to walk into a trap hardly better than knocking at the gates of the Dark Tower itself The name of Moria is black You speak of what you do not know when you liken Moria to the stronghold of Sauron answered Gandalf I alone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the Dark Lord and only in his older and lesser dwelling in Dol Guldur Those who pass the gates of Baraddr do not return But I would not lead you into Moria if there were no hope of coming out again If there are Orcs there it may prove ill for us that is true But most of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the Battle of Five Armies The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar but there is a hope that Moria is still free There is even a chance that Dwarves are there and that in some deep hall of his fathers Balin son of Fundin may be found However it may prove one must tread the path that need chooses I will tread the path with you Gandalf said Gimli I will go and look on the halls of Durin whatever may wait thereif you can find the doors that are shut Good Gimli said Gandalf You encourage me We will seek the hidden doors together And we will come through In the ruins of the Dwarves a dwarfs head will be less easy to bewilder than Elves or Men or Hobbits Yet it will not be the first time that I have been to Moria I sought there long for Thrin son of Thrr after he was lost I passed through and I came out again alive I too once passed the Dimrill Gate said Aragorn quietly but though I also came out again the memory is very evil I do not wish to enter Moria a second time And I dont wish to enter it even once said Pippin Nor me muttered Sam Of course not said Gandalf Who would But the question is who will follow me if I lead you there I will said Gimli eagerly I will said Aragorn heavily You followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow and have said no word of blame I will follow your lead now if this last warning does not move you It is not of the Ring nor of us others that I am thinking now but of you Gandalf And I say to you if you pass the doors of Moria beware I will _not_ go said Boromir not unless the vote of the whole company is against me What do Legolas and the little folk say The Ringbearers voice surely should be heard I do not wish to go to Moria said Legolas The hobbits said nothing Sam looked at Frodo At last Frodo spoke I do not wish to go he said but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of Gandalf I beg that there should be no vote until we have slept on it Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom How the wind howls At these words all fell into silent thought They heard the wind hissing among the rocks and trees and there was a howling and wailing round them in the empty spaces of the night Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet How the wind howls he cried It is howling with wolfvoices The Wargs have come west of the Mountains Need we wait until morning then said Gandalf It is as I said The hunt is up Even if we live to see the dawn who now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves on his trail How far is Moria asked Boromir There was a door southwest of Caradhras some fifteen miles as the crow flies and maybe twenty as the wolf runs answered Gandalf grimly Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow if we can said Boromir The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears True said Aragorn loosening his sword in its sheath But where the warg howls there also the orc prowls I wish I had taken Elronds advice muttered Pippin to Sam I am no good after all There is not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer in me these howls freeze my blood I dont ever remember feeling so wretched My hearts right down in my toes Mr Pippin said Sam But we arent etten yet and there are some stout folk here with us Whatever may be in store for old Gandalf Ill wager it isnt a wolfs belly For their defence in the night the Company climbed to the top of the small hill under which they had been sheltering it was crowned with a knot of old and twisted trees about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones In the midst of this they lit a fire for there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs Round the fire they sat and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily Poor Bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood The howling of the wolves was now all round them sometimes nearer and sometimes further off In the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen peering over the brow of the hill Some advanced almost to the ring of stones At a gap in the circle a great dark wolfshape could be seen halted gazing at them A shuddering howl broke from him as if he were a captain summoning his pack to the assault Gandalf stood up and strode forward holding his staff aloft Listen Hound of Sauron he cried Gandalf is here Fly if you value your foul skin I will shrivel you from tail to snout if you come within this ring The wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap At that moment there was a sharp twang Legolas had loosed his bow There was a hideous yell and the leaping shape thudded to the ground the elvish arrow had pierced its throat The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward but the hill was deserted the hunting packs had fled All about them the darkness grew silent and no cry came on the sighing wind The night was old and westward the waning moon was setting gleaming fitfully through the breaking clouds Suddenly Frodo started from sleep Without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the camp A great host of Wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them from every side at once Fling fuel on the fire cried Gandalf to the hobbits Draw your blades and stand back to back In the leaping light as the fresh wood blazed up Frodo saw many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones More and more followed Through the throat of one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust with a great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another Beside them Gimli stood with his stout legs apart wielding his dwarfaxe The bow of Legolas was singing In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow he rose up a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill Stooping like a cloud he lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the wolves They gave back before him High in the air he tossed the blazing brand It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning and his voice rolled like thunder _Naur an edraith ammen Naur dan i ngaurhoth_ he cried There was a roar and a crackle and the tree above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame The fire leapt from treetop to treetop The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light The swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered The last arrow of Legolas kindled in the air as it flew and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolfchieftain All the others fled Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks a bitter smoke curled above the burned treestumps and blew darkly from the hill as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky Their enemies were routed and did not return What did I tell you Mr Pippin said Sam shething his sword Wolves wont get him That was an eyeopener and no mistake Nearly singed the hair off my head When the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to be found and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead No trace of the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on the hilltop All were undamaged save one of which only the point was left It is as I feared said Gandalf These were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness Let us eat quickly and go That day the weather changed again almost as if it was at the command of some power that had no longer any use for snow since they had retreated from the pass a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away The wind had been turning through north to northwest during the night and now it failed The clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened high and blue As they stood upon the hillside ready to depart a pale sunlight gleamed over the mountaintops We must reach the doors before sunset said Gandalf or I fear we shall not reach them at all It is not far but our path may be winding for here Aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked in this country and only once have I been under the west wall of Moria and that was long ago There it lies he said pointing away southeastwards to where the mountains sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet In the distance could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs and in their midst taller than the rest one great grey wall When we left the pass I led you southwards and not back to our starting point as some of you may have noticed It is well that I did so for now we have several miles less to cross and haste is needed Let us go I do not know which to hope said Boromir grimly that Gandalf will find what he seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever All choices seem ill and to be caught between wolves and the wall the likeliest chance Lead on Gimli now walked ahead by the wizards side so eager was he to come to Moria Together they led the Company back towards the mountains The only road of old to Moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream the Sirannon that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors had stood But either Gandalf was astray or else the land had changed in recent years for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it only a few miles southwards from their start The morning was passing towards noon and still the Company wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones Nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it All was bleak and dry Their hearts sank They saw no living thing and not a bird was in the sky but what the night would bring if it caught them in that lost land none of them cared to think Suddenly Gimli who had pressed on ahead called back to them He was standing on a knoll and pointing to the right Hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel It was empty and silent and hardly a trickle of water flowed among the brown and redstained stones of its bed but on the near side there was a path much broken and decayed that wound its way among the ruined walls and pavingstones of an ancient highroad Ah Here it is at last said Gandalf This is where the stream ran Sirannon the Gatestream they used to call it But what has happened to the water I cannot guess it used to be swift and noisy Come We must hurry on We are late The Company were footsore and tired but they trudged doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles The sun turned from the noon and began to go west After a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again Before them the mountains frowned but their path lay in a deep trough of land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks At length they came to a sharp bend There the road which had been veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left turned and went due east again Rounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff some five fathoms high with a broken and jagged top Over it a trickling water dripped through a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full Indeed things have changed said Gandalf But there is no mistaking the place There is all that remains of the Stair Falls If I remember right there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side but the main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level ground at the top There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right up to the Walls of Moria and the Sirannon flowed through it with the road beside it Let us go and see what things are like now They found the stone steps without difficulty and Gimli sprang swiftly up them followed by Gandalf and Frodo When they reached the top they saw that they could go no further that way and the reason for the drying up of the Gatestream was revealed Behind them the sinking Sun filled the cool western sky with glimmering gold Before them stretched a dark still lake Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface The Sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the valley Beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs their stern faces pallid in the fading light final and impassable No sign of gate or entrance not a fissure or crack could Frodo see in the frowning stone There are the Walls of Moria said Gandalf pointing across the water And there the Gate stood once upon a time the Elven Door at the end of the road from Hollin by which we have come But this way is blocked None of the Company I guess will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of the day It has an unwholesome look We must find a way round the northern edge said Gimli The first thing for the Company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us Even if there were no lake we could not get our baggagepony up this stair But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines said Gandalf The road under the mountains is a dark road and there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread even if we can Poor old Bill said Frodo I had not thought of that And poor Sam I wonder what he will say I am sorry said Gandalf Poor Bill has been a useful companion and it goes to my heart to turn him adrift now I would have travelled lighter and brought no animal least of all this one that Sam is fond of if I had had my way I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road The day was drawing to its end and cold stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset when the Company with all the speed they could climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake In breadth it looked to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point How far it stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light but its northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood and between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the waters edge there was a rim of open ground They hurried forward for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for and then he had still to find the doors When they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a narrow creek that barred their way It was green and stagnant thrust out like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills Gimli strode forward undeterred and found that the water was shallow no more than ankledeep at the edge Behind him they walked in file threading their way with care for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones and footing was treacherous Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on his feet As Sam the last of the Company led Bill up on to the dry ground on the far side there came a soft sound a swish followed by a plop as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water Turning quickly they saw ripples blackedged with shadow in the waning light great rings were widening outwards from a point far out in the lake There was a bubbling noise and then silence The dusk deepened and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace and the others followed as quickly as they could They reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs it was narrow often hardly a dozen yards across and encumbered with fallen rock and stones but they found a way hugging the cliff and keeping as far from the dark water as they might A mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees Stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows the remains it seemed of old thickets or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley But close under the cliff there stood still strong and living two tall trees larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined Their great roots spread from the wall to the water Under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes when seen far off from the top of the Stair but now they towered overhead stiff dark and silent throwing deep nightshadows about their feet standing like sentinel pillars at the end of the road Well here we are at last said Gandalf Here the Elvenway from Hollin ended Holly was the token of the people of that land and they planted it here to mark the end of their domain for the Westdoor was made chiefly for their use in their traffic with the Lords of Moria Those were happier days when there was still close friendship at times between folk of different race even between Dwarves and Elves It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship waned said Gimli I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves said Legolas I have heard both said Gandalf and I will not give judgement now But I beg you two Legolas and Gimli at least to be friends and to help me I need you both The doors are shut and hidden and the sooner we find them the better Night is at hand Turning to the others he said While I am searching will you each make ready to enter the Mines For here I fear we must say farewell to our good beast of burden You must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought against bitter weather you will not need it inside nor I hope when we come through and journey on down into the South Instead each of us must take a share of what the pony carried especially the food and the waterskins But you cant leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place Mr Gandalf cried Sam angry and distressed I wont have it and thats flat After he has come so far and all I am sorry Sam said the wizard But when the Door opens I do not think you will be able to drag your Bill inside into the long dark of Moria You will have to choose between Bill and your master Hed follow Mr Frodo into a dragons den if I led him protested Sam Itd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these wolves about It will be short of murder I hope said Gandalf He laid his hand on the ponys head and spoke in a low voice Go with words of guard and guiding on you he said You are a wise beast and have learned much in Rivendell Make your ways to places where you can find grass and so come in time to Elronds house or wherever you wish to go There Sam He will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and getting home as we have Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer Bill seeming to understand well what was going on nuzzled up to him putting his nose to Sams ear Sam burst into tears and fumbled with the straps unlading all the ponys packs and throwing them on the ground The others sorted out the goods making a pile of all that could be left behind and dividing up the rest When this was done they turned to watch Gandalf He appeared to have done nothing He was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall of the cliff as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes Gimli was wandering about tapping the stone here and there with his axe Legolas was pressed against the rock as if listening Well here we are and all ready said Merry but where are the Doors I cant see any sign of them Dwarfdoors are not made to be seen when shut said Gimli They are invisible and their own masters cannot find them or open them if their secret is forgotten But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves said Gandalf coming suddenly to life and turning round Unless things are altogether changed eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs He walked forward to the wall Right between the shadow of the trees there was a smooth space and over this he passed his hands to and fro muttering words under his breath Then he stepped back Look he said Can you see anything now The Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock but they could see nothing else for a while Then slowly on the surface where the wizards hands had passed faint lines appeared like slender veins of silver running in the stone At first they were no more than pale gossamerthreads so fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the Moon caught them but steadily they grew broader and clearer until their design could be guessed At the top as high as Gandalf could reach was an arch of interlacing letters in an Elvish character Below though the threads were in places blurred or broken the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars Beneath these again were two trees each bearing crescent moons More clearly than all else there shone forth in the middle of the door a single star with many rays There are the emblems of Durin cried Gimli And there is the Tree of the High Elves said Legolas And the Star of the House of Fanor said Gandalf They are wrought of _ithildin_ that mirrors only starlight and moonlight and sleeps until it is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middleearth It is long since I heard them and I thought deeply before I could recall them to my mind What does the writing say asked Frodo who was trying to decipher the inscription on the arch I thought I knew the elfletters but I cannot read these The words are in the elventongue of the West of Middleearth in the Elder Days answered Gandalf But they do not say anything of importance to us They say only _The Doors of Durin Lord of Moria Speak friend and enter_ And underneath small and faint is written _I Narvi made them Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs_ What does it mean by _speak friend and enter_ asked Merry That is plain enough said Gimli If you are a friend speak the password and the doors will open and you can enter Yes said Gandalf these doors are probably governed by words Some dwarfgates will open only at special times or for particular persons and some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and words are known These doors have no key In the days of Durin they were not secret They usually stood open and doorwards sat here But if they were shut any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in At least so it is recorded is it not Gimli It is said the dwarf But what the word was is not remembered Narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth But do not _you_ know the word Gandalf asked Boromir in surprise No said the wizard The others looked dismayed only Aragorn who knew Gandalf well remained silent and unmoved Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot cried Boromir glancing back with a shudder at the dark water You told us that you had once passed through the Mines How could that be if you did not know how to enter The answer to your first question Boromir said the wizard is that I do not know the wordyet But we shall soon see And he added with a glint in his eyes under their bristling brows you may ask what is the use of my deeds when they are proved useless As for your other question do you doubt my tale Or have you no wits left I did not enter this way I came from the East If you wish to know I will tell you that these doors open outwards From the inside you may thrust them open with your hands From the outside nothing will move them save the spell of command They cannot be forced inwards What are you going to do then asked Pippin undaunted by the wizards bristling brows Knock on the doors with your head Peregrin Took said Gandalf But if that does not shatter them and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions I will seek for the opening words I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men or Orcs that was ever used for such a purpose I can still remember ten score of them without searching in my mind But only a few trials I think will be needed and I shall not have to call on Gimli for words of the secret dwarftongue that they teach to none The opening words were Elvish like the writing on the arch that seems certain He stepped up to the rock again and lightly touched with his staff the silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil Annon edhellen edro hi ammen Fennas nogothrim lasto beth lammen he said in a commanding voice The silver lines faded but the blank grey stone did not stir Many times he repeated these words in different order or varied them Then he tried other spells one after another speaking now faster and louder now soft and slow Then he spoke many single words of Elvish speech Nothing happened The cliff towered into the night the countless stars were kindled the wind blew cold and the doors stood fast Again Gandalf approached the wall and lifting up his arms he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath _Edro edro_ he cried and struck the rock with his staff _Open open_ he shouted and followed it with the same command in every language that had ever been spoken in the West of Middleearth Then he threw his staff on the ground and sat down in silence At that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the howling of wolves Bill the pony started in fear and Sam sprang to his side and whispered softly to him Do not let him run away said Boromir It seems that we shall need him still if the wolves do not find us How I hate this foul pool He stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water The stone vanished with a soft slap but at the same instant there was a swish and a bubble Great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where the stone had fallen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff Why did you do that Boromir said Frodo I hate this place too and I am afraid I dont know of what not of wolves or the dark behind the doors but of something else I am afraid of the pool Dont disturb it l wish we could get away said Merry Why doesnt Gandalf do something quick said Pippin Gandalf took no notice of them He sat with his head bowed either in despair or in anxious thought The mournful howling of the wolves was heard again The ripples on the water grew and came closer some were already lapping on the shore With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet He was laughing I have it he cried Of course of course Absurdly simple like most riddles when you see the answer Picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear voice _Mellon_ The star shone out briefly and faded again Then silently a great doorway was outlined though not a crack or joint had been visible before Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch until both doors lay back against the wall Through the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the night The Company stared in wonder I was wrong after all said Gandalf and Gimli too Merry of all people was on the right track The opening word was inscribed on the archway all the time The translation should have been _Say Friend and enter_ I had only to speak the Elvish word for _friend_ and the doors opened Quite simple Too simple for a learned loremaster in these suspicious days Those were happier times Now let us go He strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step But at that moment several things happened Frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry Bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear and turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness Sam leaped after him and then hearing Frodos cry he ran back again weeping and cursing The others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething as if a host of snakes were swimming up from the southern end Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled it was palegreen and luminous and wet Its fingered end had hold of Frodos foot and was dragging him into the water Sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife The arm let go of Frodo and Sam pulled him away crying out for help Twenty others arms came rippling out The dark water boiled and there was a hideous stench Into the gateway Up the stairs Quick shouted Gandalf leaping back Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to the ground where they stood he drove them forward They were just in time Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up and Gandalf had just begun to climb when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliffwall and the doors One came wriggling over the threshold glistening in the starlight Gandalf turned and paused If he was considering what word would close the gate again from within there was no need Many coiling arms seized the doors on either side and with horrible strength swung them round With a shattering echo they slammed and all light was lost A noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone Sam clinging to Frodos arm collapsed on a step in the black darkness Poor old Bill he said in a choking voice Poor old Bill Wolves and snakes But the snakes were too much for him I had to choose Mr Frodo I had to come with you They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled but the doors did not open Well well said the wizard The passage is blocked behind us now and there is only one way outon the other side of the mountains I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate I am sorry for the trees were beautiful and had stood so long I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water said Frodo What was the thing or were there many of them I do not know answered Gandalf but the arms were all guided by one purpose Something has crept or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountains There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it was that dwelt in the lake it had seized on Frodo first among all the Company Boromir muttered under his breath but the echoing stone magnified the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear In the deep places of the world And thither we are going against my wish Who will lead us now in this deadly dark I will said Gandalf and Gimli shall walk with me Follow my staff As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps he held his staff aloft and from its tip there came a faint radiance The wide stairway was sound and undamaged Two hundred steps they counted broad and shallow and at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into the dark Let us sit and rest and have something to eat here on the landing since we cant find a diningroom said Frodo He had begun to shake off the terror of the clutching arm and suddenly he felt extremely hungry The proposal was welcomed by all and they sat down on the upper steps dim figures in the gloom After they had eaten Gandalf gave them each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell It will not last much longer I am afraid he said but I think we need it after that horror at the gate And unless we have great luck we shall need all that is left before we see the other side Go carefully with the water too There are many streams and wells in the Mines but they should not be touched We may not have a chance of filling our skins and bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale How long is that going to take us asked Frodo I cannot say answered Gandalf It depends on many chances But going straight without mishap or losing our way we shall take three or four marches I expect It cannot be less than forty miles from Westdoor to Eastgate in a direct line and the road may wind much After only a brief rest they started on their way again All were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible and were willing tired as they were to go on marching still for several hours Gandalf walked in front as before In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff the light of which just showed the ground before his feet in his right he held his sword Glamdring Behind him came Gimli his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side Behind the dwarf walked Frodo and he had drawn the short sword Sting No gleam came from the blades of Sting or of Glamdring and that was some comfort for being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light if any Orcs were near at hand Behind Frodo went Sam and after him Legolas and the young hobbits and Boromir In the dark at the rear grim and silent walked Aragorn The passage twisted round a few turns and then began to descend It went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again The air grew hot and stifling but it was not foul and at times they felt currents of cooler air upon their faces issuing from halfguessed openings in the walls There were many of these In the pale ray of the wizards staff Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and tunnels sloping up or running steeply down or opening blankly dark on either side It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering Gimli aided Gandalf very little except by his stout courage At least he was not as were most of the others troubled by the mere darkness in itself Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful but it was always Gandalf who had the final word The Mines of Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli Glins son dwarf of the mountainrace though he was To Gandalf the faroff memories of a journey long before were now of little help but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go and he did not falter as long as there was a path that led towards his goal Do not be afraid said Aragorn There was a pause longer than usual and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together the others were crowded behind waiting anxiously Do not be afraid I have been with him on many a journey if never on one so dark and there are tales of Rivendell of greater deeds of his than any that I have seen He will not go astrayif there is any path to find He has led us in here against our fears but he will lead us out again at whatever cost to himself He is surer of finding the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Berthiel It was well for the Company that they had such a guide They had no fuel nor any means of making torches in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind But without any light they would soon have come to grief There were not only many roads to choose from there were also in many places holes and pitfalls and dark wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed There were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor and every now and then a crack would open right before their feet The widest was more than seven feet across and it was long before Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap The noise of churning water came up from far below as if some great millwheel was turning in the depths Rope muttered Sam I knew Id want it if I hadnt got it As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower Already they seemed to have been tramping on on endlessly to the mountains roots They were more than weary and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywhere Frodos spirits had risen for a while after his escape and after food and a draught of the cordial but now a deep uneasiness growing to dread crept over him again Though he had been healed in Rivendell of the knifestroke that grim wound had not been without effect His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be seen One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions save perhaps Gandalf And he was in any case the bearer of the Ring it hung upon its chain against his breast and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight He felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following but he said nothing He gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly The Company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried whispers There was no sound but the sound of their own feet the dull stump of Gimlis dwarfboots the heavy tread of Boromir the light step of Legolas the soft scarceheard patter of hobbitfeet and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride When they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water Yet Frodo began to hear or to imagine that he heard something else like the faint fall of soft bare feet It was never loud enough or near enough for him to feel certain that he heard it but once it had started it never stopped while the Company was moving But it was not an echo for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself and then grew still It was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines They had been going for several hours with only brief halts when Gandalf came to his first serious check Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages all led in the same general direction eastwards but the lefthand passage plunged down while the righthand climbed up and the middle way seemed to run on smooth and level but very narrow I have no memory of this place at all said Gandalf standing uncertainly under the arch He held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or inscription that might help his choice but nothing of the kind was to be seen I am too weary to decide he said shaking his head And I expect that you are all as weary as I am or wearier We had better halt here for what is left of the night You know what I mean In here it is ever dark but outside the late Moon is riding westward and the middlenight has passed Poor old Bill said Sam I wonder where he is I hope those wolves havent got him yet To the left of the great arch they found a stone door it was half closed but swung back easily to a gentle thrust Beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock Steady Steady cried Gandalf as Merry and Pippin pushed forward glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage Steady You do not know what is inside yet I will go first He went in cautiously and the others filed behind There he said pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor Before his feet they saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well Broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pit Fragments of stone lay near One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the bottom said Aragorn to Merry Let the guide go first while you have one This seems to have been a guardroom made for the watching of the three passages said Gimli That hole was plainly a well for the guards use covered with a stone lid But the lid is broken and we must all take care in the dark Pippin felt curiously attracted by the well While the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber as far as possible from the hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peered over A chill air seemed to strike his face rising from invisible depths Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone and let it drop He felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound Then far below as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place there came a _plunk_ very distant but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft Whats that cried Gandalf He was relieved when Pippin confessed what he had done but he was angry and Pippin could see his eye glinting Fool of a Took he growled This is a serious journey not a hobbit walkingparty Throw yourself in next time and then you will be no further nuisance Now be quiet Nothing more was heard for several minutes but then there came out of the depths faint knocks _tomtap taptom_ They stopped and when the echoes had died away they were repeated _taptom tomtap taptap tom_ They sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort but after a while the knocking died away and was not heard again That was the sound of a hammer or I have never heard one said Gimli Yes said Gandalf and I do not like it It may have nothing to do with Peregrins foolish stone but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet Pray do nothing of the kind again Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble You Pippin can go on the first watch as a reward he growled as he rolled himself in a blanket Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark but he kept on turning round fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well He wished he could cover the hole if only with a blanket but he dared not move or go near it even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep Actually Gandalf was awake though lying still and silent He was deep in thought trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the Mines and considering anxiously the next course that he should take a false turn now might be disastrous After an hour he rose up and came over to Pippin Get into a corner and have a sleep my lad he said in a kindly tone You want to sleep I expect I cannot get a wink so I may as well do the watching I know what is the matter with me he muttered as he sat down by the door I need smoke I have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm The last thing that Pippin saw as sleep took him was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees The flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose and the puff of smoke It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep He had sat and watched all alone for about six hours and had let the others rest And in the watches I have made up my mind he said I do not like the feel of the middle way and I do not like the smell of the lefthand way there is foul air down there or I am no guide I shall take the righthand passage It is time we began to climb up again For eight dark hours not counting two brief halts they marched on and they met no danger and heard nothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizards light bobbing like a willothewisp in front of them The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards As far as they could judge it went in great mounting curves and as it rose it grew loftier and wider There were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side and the floor was level and sound without pits or cracks Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road and they went forward quicker than they had done on their first march In this way they advanced some fifteen miles measured in a direct line east though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more As the road climbed upwards Frodos spirits rose a little but he still felt oppressed and still at times he heard or thought he heard away behind the Company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet a following footstep that was not an echo They had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest and all were thinking of a place where they could sleep when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished They seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black and empty space There was a great draught of warmer air behind them and before them the darkness was cold on their faces They halted and crowded anxiously together Gandalf seemed pleased I chose the right way he said At last we are coming to the habitable parts and I guess that we are not far now from the eastern side But we are high up a good deal higher than the Dimrill Gate unless I am mistaken From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall I will now risk a little real light He raised his staff and for a brief instant there was blaze like a flash of lightning Great shadows sprang up and fled and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall its black walls polished and smooth as glass flashed and glittered Three other entrances they saw dark black arches one straight before them eastwards and one on either side Then the light went out That is all that I shall venture on for the present said Gandalf There used to be great windows on the mountainside and shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines I think we have reached them now but it is night outside again and we cannot tell until morning If I am right tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in But in the meanwhile we had better go no further Let us rest if we can Things have gone well so far and the greater part of the dark road is over But we are not through yet and it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the world The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall huddled close together in a corner to escape the draught there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill air through the eastern archway All about them as they lay hung the darkness hollow and immense and they were oppressed by the loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time said Sam and every one of them busier than badgers for five hundred years to make all this and most in hard rock too What did they do it all for They didnt live in these darksome holes surely These are not holes said Gimli This is the great realm and city of the Dwarrowdelf And of old it was not darksome but full of light and splendour as is still remembered in our songs He rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice while the echoes ran away into the roof The world was young the mountains green No stain yet on the Moon was seen No words were laid on stream or stone When Durin woke and walked alone He named the nameless hills and dells He drank from yet untasted wells He stooped and looked in Mirrormere And saw a crown of stars appear As gems upon a silver thread Above the shadow of his head The world was fair the mountains tall In Elder Days before the fall Of mighty kings in Nargothrond And Gondolin who now beyond The Western Seas have passed away The world was fair in Durins Day A king he was on carven throne In manypillared halls of stone With golden roof and silver floor And runes of power upon the door The light of sun and star and moon In shining lamps of crystal hewn Undimmed by cloud or shade of night There shone for ever fair and bright There hammer on the anvil smote There chisel clove and graver wrote There forged was blade and bound was hilt The delver mined the mason built There beryl pearl and opal pale And metal wrought like fishes mail Buckler and corslet axe and sword And shining spears were laid in hoard Unwearied then were Durins folk Beneath the mountains music woke The harpers harped the minstrels sang And at the gates the trumpets rang The world is grey the mountains old The forges fire is ashencold No harp is wrung no hammer falls The darkness dwells in Durins halls The shadow lies upon his tomb In Moria in Khazaddm But still the sunken stars appear In dark and windless Mirrormere There lies his crown in water deep Till Durin wakes again from sleep I like that said Sam I should like to learn it _In Moria in Khazaddm_ But it makes the darkness seem heavier thinking of all those lamps Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here still Gimli was silent Having sung his song he would say no more Piles of jewels said Gandalf No The Orcs have often plundered Moria there is nothing left in the upper halls And since the dwarves fled no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places they are drowned in wateror in a shadow of fear Then what do the dwarves want to come back for asked Sam For _mithril_ answered Gandalf The wealth of Moria was not in gold and jewels the toys of the Dwarves nor in iron their servant Such things they found here it is true especially iron but they did not need to delve for them all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic For here alone in the world was found Moriasilver or truesilver as some have called it _mithril_ is the Elvish name The Dwarves have a name which they do not tell Its worth was ten times that of gold and now it is beyond price for little is left above ground and even the Orcs dare not delve here for it The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras and down to darkness The Dwarves tell no tale but even as _mithril_ was the foundation of their wealth so also it was their destruction they delved too greedily and too deep and disturbed that from which they fled Durins Bane Of what they brought to light the Orcs have gathered nearly all and given it in tribute to Sauron who covets it _Mithril_ All folk desired it It could be beaten like copper and polished like glass and the Dwarves could make of it a metal light and yet harder than tempered steel Its beauty was like to that of common silver but the beauty of _mithril_ did not tarnish or grow dim The Elves dearly loved it and among many uses they made of it _ithildin_ starmoon which you saw upon the doors Bilbo had a corslet of mithrilrings that Thorin gave him I wonder what has become of it Gathering dust still in Michel Delving Mathomhouse I suppose What cried Gimli startled out of his silence A corslet of Moriasilver That was a kingly gift Yes said Gandalf I never told him but its worth was greater than the value of the whole Shire and everything in it Frodo said nothing but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the rings of his mailshirt He felt staggered to think that he had been walking about with the price of the Shire under his jacket Had Bilbo known He felt no doubt that Bilbo knew quite well It was indeed a kingly gift But now his thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines to Rivendell to Bilbo and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there He wished with all his heart that he was back there and in those days mowing the lawn or pottering among the flowers and that he had never heard of Moria or _mithril _or the Ring A deep silence fell One by one the others fell asleep Frodo was on guard As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep places dread came over him His hands were cold and his brow damp He listened All his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow hours but he heard no sound not even the imagined echo of a footfall His watch was nearly over when far off where he guessed that the western archway stood he fancied that he could see two pale points of light almost like luminous eyes He started His head had nodded I must have nearly fallen asleep on guard he thought I was on the edge of a dream He stood up and rubbed his eyes and remained standing peering into the dark until he was relieved by Legolas When he lay down he quickly went to sleep but it seemed to him that the dream went on he heard whispers and saw the two pale points of light approaching slowly He woke and found that the others were speaking softly near him and that a dim light was falling on his face High up above the eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam and across the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly Frodo sat up Good morning said Gandalf For morning it is again at last I was right you see We are high up on the east side of Moria Before today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters of Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us I shall be glad said Gimli I have looked on Moria and it is very great but it has become dark and dreadful and we have found no sign of my kindred I doubt now that Balin ever came here After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once We are tired but we shall rest better when we are outside he said I think that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria No indeed said Boromir Which way shall we take Yonder eastward arch Maybe said Gandalf But I du not know yet exactly where we are Unless I am quite astray I guess that we are above and to the north of the Great Gates and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them The eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take but before we make up our minds we ought to look about us Let us go towards that light in the north door If we could find a window it would help but I fear that the light comes only down deep shafts Following his lead the Company passed under the northern arch They found themselves in a wide corridor As they went along it the glimmer grew stronger and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right It was high and flattopped and the stone door was still upon its hinges standing half open Beyond it was a large square chamber It was dimly lit but to their eyes after so long a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingly bright and they blinked as they entered Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor and stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall it slanted upwards and far above a small square patch of blue sky could be seen The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room a single oblong block about two feet high upon which was laid a great slab of white stone It looks like a tomb muttered Frodo and bent forwards with a curious sense of foreboding to look more closely at it Gandalf came quickly to his side On the slab runes were deeply graven These are Daerons Runes such as were used of old in Moria said Gandalf Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves BALIN SON OF FUNDIN LORD OF MORIA He is dead then said Frodo I feared it was so Gimli cast his hood over his face _Chapter 5_ The Bridge of Khazaddm The Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin Frodo thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf and of Balins visit to the Shire long ago In that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world At length they stirred and looked up and began to search for anything that would give them tidings of Balins fate or show what had become of his folk There was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber under the shaft By both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying and among them were broken swords and axeheads and cloven shields and helms Some of the swords were crooked orcscimitars with blackened blades There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls and in them were large ironbound chests of wood All had been broken and plundered but beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book It had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned and it was so stained with black and other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read Gandalf lifted it carefully but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the slab He pored over it for some time without speaking Frodo and Gimli standing at his side could see as he gingerly turned the leaves that they were written by many different hands in runes both of Moria and of Dale and here and there in Elvish script At last Gandalf looked up It seems to be a record of the fortunes of Balins folk he said I guess that it began with their coming to Dimrill Dale nigh on thirty years ago the pages seem to have numbers referring to the years after their arrival The top page is marked _one three_ so at least two are missing from the beginning Listen to this _We drove out orcs from the great gate and guard_ I think the next word is blurred and burned probably _room_ _we slew many in the bright_ I think _sun in the dale Fli was killed by an arrow He slew the great_ Then there is a blur followed by _Fli under grass near Mirror mere_ The next line or two I cannot read Then comes _We have taken the twentyfirst hall of North end to dwell in There is_I cannot read what A _shaft_ is mentioned Then _Balin has set up his seat in the Chamber of Mazarbul_ The Chamber of Records said Gimli I guess that is where we now stand Well I can read no more for a long way said Gandalf except the word _gold_ and _Durins Axe_ and something _helm_ Then _Balin is now lord of Moria_ That seems to end a chapter After some stars another hand begins and I can see _we found truesilver_ and later the word _wellforged_ and then something I have it _mithril_ and the last two lines _in to seek for the upper armouries of Third Deep_ something _go westwards_ a blur_ to Hollin gate_ Gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside There are several pages of the same sort rather hastily written and much damaged he said but I can make little of them in this light Now there must be a number of leaves missing because they begin to be numbered _five_ the fifth year of the colony I suppose Let me see No they are too cut and stained I cannot read them We might do better in the sunlight Wait Here is something a large bold hand using an Elvish script That would be Oris hand said Gimli looking over the wizards arm He could write well and speedily and often used the Elvish characters I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand said Gandalf The first clear word is _sorrow_ but the rest of the line is lost unless it ends in _estre_ Yes it must be _yestre_ followed by _day being the tenth of novembre Balin lord of Moria fell in Dimrill Dale He went alone to look in Mirror mere an orc shot him from behind a stone we slew the orc hut many more up from east up the Silverlode_ The remainder of the page is so blurred that I can hardly make anything out but I think I can read_ we have barred the gates_ and then _can hold them long if_ and then perhaps _horrible_ and _suffer_ Poor Balin He seems to have kept the title that he took for less than five years I wonder what happened afterwards but there is no time to puzzle out the last few pages Here is the last page of all He paused and sighed It is grim reading he said I fear their end was cruel Listen _We cannot get out We cannot get out They have taken the Bridge and second hall Frr and Lni and Nli fell there_ Then there are four lines smeared so that I can only _read went _ The last lines _run the pool is up to the wall at Westgate The Watcher in the Water took in We cannot get out The end comes_ and then_ drums drums in the deep_ I wonder what that means The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elfletters _they are coming_ There is nothing more Gandalf paused and stood in silent thought A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company _We cannot get out_ muttered Gimli It was well for us that the pool had sunk a little and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end Gandalf raised his head and looked round They seem to have made a last stand by both doors he said but there were not many left by that time So ended the attempt to retake Moria It was valiant but foolish The time is not come yet Now I fear we must say farewell to Balin son of Fundin Here he must lie in the halls of his fathers We will take this book the Book of Mazarbul and look at it more closely later You had better keep it Gimli and take it back to Din if you get a chance It will interest him though it will grieve him deeply Come let us go The morning is passing Which way shall we go asked Boromir Back to the hall answered Gandalf But our visit to this room has not been in vain I now know where we are This must be as Gimli says the Chamber of Mazarbul and the hall must be the twentyfirst of the Northend Therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall and bear right and south and go downwards The Twentyfirst Hall should be on the Seventh Level that is six above the level of the Gates Come now Back to the hall Gandalf had hardly spoken these words when there came a great noise a rolling _Boom_ that seemed to come from depths far below and to tremble in the stone at their feet They sprang towards the door in alarm _Doom doom_ it rolled again as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of Moria into a vast drum Then there came an echoing blast a great horn was blown in the hall and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off There was a hurrying sound of many feet They are coming cried Legolas We cannot get out said Gimli Trapped cried Gandalf Why did I delay Here we are caught just as they were before But I was not here then We will see what _Doom doom_ came the drumbeat and the walls shook Slam the doors and wedge them shouted Aragorn And keep your packs on as long as you can we may get a chance to cut our way out yet No said Gandalf We must not get shut in Keep the east door ajar We will go that way if we get a chance Another harsh horncall and shrill cries rang out Feet were coming down the corridor There was a ring and clatter as the Company drew their swords Glamdring shone with a pale light and Sting glinted at the edges Boromir set his shoulder against the western door Wait a moment Do not close it yet said Gandalf He sprang forward to Boromirs side and drew himself up to his full height Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of Moria he cried in a loud voice There was a rush of hoarse laughter like the fall of sliding stones into a pit amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command Doom boom doom went the drums in the deep With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the door and thrust forward his staff There was a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside For an instant the wizard looked out Arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back There are Orcs very many of them he said And some are large and evil black Uruks of Mordor For the moment they are hanging back but there is something else there A great cavetroll I think or more than one There is no hope of escape that way And no hope at all if they come at the other door as well said Boromir There is no sound outside here yet said Aragorn who was standing by the eastern door listening The passage on this side plunges straight down a stair it plainly does not lead back towards the hall But it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind We cannot block the door Its key is gone and the lock is broken and it opens inwards We must do something to delay the enemy first We will make them fear the Chamber of Mazarbul he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword Andril Heavy feet were heard in the corridor Boromir flung himself against the door and heaved it to then he wedged it with broken swordblades and splinters of wood The Company retreated to the other side of the chamber But they had no chance to fly yet There was a blow on the door that made it quiver and then it began to grind slowly open driving back the wedges A huge arm and shoulder with a dark skin of greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap Then a great flat toeless foot was forced through below There was a dead silence outside Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might but his sword rang glanced aside and fell from his shaken hand The blade was notched Suddenly and to his own surprise Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in his heart The Shire he cried and springing beside Boromir he stooped and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot There was a bellow and the foot jerked back nearly wrenching Sting from Frodos arm Black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the floor Boromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it again One for the Shire cried Aragorn The hobbits bite is deep You have a good blade Frodo son of Drogo There was a crash on the door followed by crash after crash Rams and hammers were beating against it It cracked and staggered back and the opening grew suddenly wide Arrows came whistling in but struck the northern wall and fell harmlessly to the floor There was a hornblast and a rush of feet and orcs one after another leaped into the chamber How many there were the Company could not count The affray was sharp but the orcs were dismayed by the fierceness of the defence Legolas shot two through the throat Gimli hewed the legs from under another that had sprung up on Balins tomb Boromir and Aragorn slew many When thirteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking leaving the defenders unharmed except for Sam who had a scratch along the scalp A quick duck had saved him and he had felled his orc a sturdy thrust with his Barrowblade A fire was smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step backwards if he had seen it Now is the time cried Gandalf Let us go before the troll returns But even as they retreated and before Pippin and Merry had reached the stair outside a huge orcchieftain almost manhigh clad in black mail from head to foot leaped into the chamber behind him his followers clustered in the doorway His broad flat face was swart his eyes were like coals and his tongue was red he wielded a great spear With a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned Boromirs sword and bore him backwards throwing him to the ground Diving under Aragorns blow with the speed of a striking snake he charged into the Company and thrust with his spear straight at Frodo The blow caught him on the right side and Frodo was hurled against the wall and pinned Sam with a cry hacked at the spearshaft and it broke But even as the orc flung down the truncheon and swept out his scimitar Andril came down upon his helm There was a flash like flame and the helm burst asunder The orc fell with cloven head His followers fled howling as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them _Doom doom_ went the drums in the deep The great voice rolled out again Now shouted Gandalf Now is the last chance Run for it Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the stair pushing Merry and Pippin in front of him The others followed but Gimli had to be dragged away by Legolas in spite of the peril he lingered by Balins tomb with his head bowed Boromir hauled the eastern door to grinding upon its hinges it had great iron rings on either side but could not be fastened I am all right gasped Frodo I can walk Put me down Aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement I thought you were dead he cried Not yet said Gandalf But there is time for wonder Off you go all of you down the stairs Wait a few minutes for me at the bottom but if I do not come soon go on Go quickly and choose paths leading right and downwards We cannot leave you to hold the door alone said Aragorn Do as I say said Gandalf fiercely Swords are no more use here Go The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark They groped their way down a long flight of steps and then looked back but they could see nothing except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizards staff He seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door Frodo breathed heavily and leaned against Sam who put his arms about him They stood peering up the stairs into the darkness Frodo thought he could hear the voice of Gandalf above muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo He could not catch what was said The walls seemed to be trembling Every now and again the drumbeats throbbed and rolled _doom doom_ Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light Then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud The drumbeats broke out wildly _doomboom doomboom_ and then stopped Gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company Well well Thats over said the wizard struggling to his feet I have done all that I could But I have met my match and have nearly been destroyed But dont stand here Go on You will have to do without light for a while I am rather shaken Go on Go on Where are you Gimli Come ahead with me Keep close behind all of you They stumbled after him wondering what had happened _Doom doom_ went the drumbeats again they now sounded muffled and far away but they were following There was no other sound of pursuit neither tramp of feet nor any voice Gandalf took no turns right or left for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desired Every now and again it descended a flight of steps fifty or more to a lower level At the moment that was their chief danger for in the dark they could not see a descent until they came on it and put their feet out into emptiness Gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man At the end of an hour they had gone a mile or maybe a little more and had descended many flights of stairs There was still no sound of pursuit Almost they began to hope that they would escape At the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted It is getting hot he gasped We ought to be down at least to the level of the Gates now Soon I think we should look for a lefthand turn to take us east I hope it is not far I am very weary I must rest here a moment even if all the orcs ever spawned are after us Gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step What happened away up there at the door he asked Did you meet the beater of the drums I do not know answered Gandalf But I found myself suddenly faced by something that I have not met before I could think of nothing to do but to try and put a shuttingspell on the door I know many but to do things of that kind rightly requires time and even then the door can be broken by strength As I stood there I could hear orcvoices on the other side at any moment I thought they would burst it open I could not hear what was said they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language All I caught was _ghsh_ that is fire Then something came into the chamber I felt it through the door and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent It laid hold of the iron ring and then it perceived me and my spell What it was I cannot guess but I have never felt such a challenge The counterspell was terrible It nearly broke me For an instant the door left my control and began to open I had to speak a word of Command That proved too great a strain The door burst in pieces Something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light inside and I was thrown backwards down the stairs All the wall gave way and the roof of the chamber as well I think I am afraid Balin is buried deep and maybe something else is buried there too I cannot say But at least the passage behind us was completely blocked Ah I have never felt so spent but it is passing And now what about you Frodo There was not time to say so but I have never been more delighted in my life than when you spoke I feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying What about me said Frodo I am alive and whole I think I am bruised and in pain but it is not too bad Well said Aragorn I can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that I have never met the like of it Had I known I would have spoken softer in the Inn at Bree That spearthrust would have skewered a wild boar Well it did not skewer me I am glad to say said Frodo though I feel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil He said no more He found breathing painful You take after Bilbo said Gandalf There is more about you than meets the eye as I said of him long ago Frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said They now went on again Before long Gimli spoke He had keen eyes in the dark I think he said that there is a light ahead But it is not daylight It is red What can it be _Ghsh_ muttered Gandalf I wonder if that is what they meant that the lower levels are on fire Still we can only go on Soon the light became unmistakable and could be seen by all It was flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them They could now see their way in front the road sloped down swiftly and some way ahead there stood a low archway through it the glowing light came The air became very hot When they came to the arch Gandalf went through signing to them to wait As he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red glow Quickly he stepped back There is some new devilry here he said devised for our welcome no doubt But I know now where we are we have reached the First Deep the level immediately below the Gates This is the Second Hall of Old Moria and the Gates are near away beyond the eastern end on the left not more than a quarter of a mile Across the Bridge up a broad stair along a wide road through the First Hall and out But come and look They peered out Before them was another cavernous hall It was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept They were near its eastern end westward it ran away into darkness Down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars They were carved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone Their stems were smooth and black but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides Right across the floor close to the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had opened Out of it a fierce red light came and now and again flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns Wisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot air If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls we should have been trapped here said Gandalf Let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit Come There is no time to lose Even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drumbeat _Doom doom doom_ Away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came cries and horncalls _Doom doom_ the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver Now for the last race said Gandalf If the sun is shining outside we may still escape After me He turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall The distance was greater than it had looked As they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind A shrill yell went up they had been seen There was a ring and clash of steel An arrow whistled over Frodos head Boromir laughed They did not expect this he said The fire has cut them off We are on the wrong side Look ahead called Gandalf The Bridge is near It is dangerous and narrow Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm At the end of the hall the floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth The outer door could only be reached by a slender bridge of stone without kerb or rail that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet It was an ancient defence of the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the outer passages They could only pass across it in single file At the brink Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind Lead the way Gimli he said Pippin and Merry next Straight on and up the stair beyond the door Arrows fell among them One struck Frodo and sprang back Another pierced Gandalfs hat and stuck there like a black feather Frodo looked behind Beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures there seemed to be hundreds of orcs They brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as blood in the firelight _Doom doom_ rolled the drumbeats growing louder and louder _doom doom_ Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string though it was a long shot for his small bow He drew but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to the ground He gave a cry of dismay and fear Two great trolls appeared they bore great slabs of stone and flung them down to serve as gangways over the fire But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with terror The ranks of the orcs had opened and they crowded away as if they themselves were afraid Something was coming up behind them What it was could not be seen it was like a great shadow in the middle of which was a dark form of manshape maybe yet greater and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure The flames roared up to greet it and wreathed about it and a black smoke swirled in the air Its streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it In its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of many thongs Ai ai wailed Legolas A Balrog A Balrog is come Gimli stared with wide eyes Durins Bane he cried and letting his axe fall he covered his face A Balrog muttered Gandalf Now I understand He faltered and leaned heavily on his staff What an evil fortune And I am already weary The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them The orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways Then Boromir raised his horn and blew Loud the challenge rang and bellowed like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof For a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted Then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind and the enemy advanced again Over the bridge cried Gandalf recalling his strength Fly This is a foe beyond any of you I must hold the narrow way Fly Aragorn and Boromir did not heed the command but still held their ground side by side behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge The others halted just within the doorway at the halls end and turned unable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone The Balrog reached the bridge Gandalf stood in the middle of the span leaning on the staff in his left hand but in his other hand Glamdring gleamed cold and white His enemy halted again facing him and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings It raised the whip and the thongs whined and cracked Fire came from its nostrils But Gandalf stood firm You cannot pass he said The orcs stood still and a dead silence fell I am a servant of the Secret Fire wielder of the flame of Anor You cannot pass The dark fire will not avail you flame of Udn Go back to the Shadow You cannot pass The Balrog made no answer The fire in it seemed to die but the darkness grew It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height and its wings were spread from wall to wall but still Gandalf could be seen glimmering in the gloom he seemed small and altogether alone grey and bent like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming Glamdring glittered white in answer There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire The Balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments The wizard swayed on the bridge stepped back a pace and then again stood still You cannot pass he said With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge Its whip whirled and hissed He cannot stand alone cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge _Elendil_ he shouted I am with you Gandalf Gondor cried Boromir and leaped after him At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up The bridge cracked Right at the Balrogs feet it broke and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf while the rest remained poised quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward and its shadow plunged down and vanished But even as it fell it swung its whip and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizards knees dragging him to the brink He staggered and fell grasped vainly at the stone and slid into the abyss Fly you fools he cried and was gone The fires went out and blank darkness fell The Company stood rooted with horror staring into the pit Even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying back the rest of the bridge cracked and fell With a cry Aragorn roused them Come I will lead you now he called We must obey his last command Follow me They stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door Aragorn leading Boromir at the rear At the top was a wide echoing passage Along this they fled Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping and then he found that he himself was weeping as he ran _Doom doom doom_ the drumbeats rolled behind mournful now and slow _doom_ They ran on The light grew before them great shafts pierced the roof They ran swifter They passed into a hall bright with daylight from its high windows in the east They fled across it Through its huge broken doors they passed and suddenly before them the Great Gates opened an arch of blazing light There was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great door posts towering on either side but the gates were shattered and cast down Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path and the rest fled in terror of his wrath The Company swept past them and took no heed of them Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the huge and ageworn steps the threshold of Moria Thus at last they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on their faces They did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls Dimrill Dale lay about them The shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon it but eastwards there was a golden light on the land It was but one hour after noon The sun was shining the clouds were white and high They looked back Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under the mountainshadow Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drumbeats _doom_ A thin black smoke trailed out Nothing else was to be seen the dale all around was empty _Doom_ Grief at last wholly overcame them and they wept long some standing and silent some cast upon the ground _Doom doom_ The drumbeats faded _Chapter 6_ Lothlrien Alas I Fear we cannot stay here longer said Aragorn He looked towards the mountains and held up his sword Farewell Gandalf he cried Did I not say to you _if you pass the doors of Moria beware_ Alas that I spoke true What hope have we without you He turned to the Company We must do without hope he said At least we may yet be avenged Let us gird ourselves and weep no more Come We have a long road and much to do They rose and looked about them Northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows between two great arms of the mountains above which three white peaks were shining Celebdil Fanuidhol Caradhras the Mountains of Moria At the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains feet Yonder is the Dimrill Stair said Aragorn pointing to the falls Down the deepcloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should have come if fortune had been kinder Or Caradhras less cruel said Gimli There he stands smiling in the sun He shook his fist at the furthest of the snowcapped peaks and turned away To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end and far lands could be descried beyond them wide and vague To the south the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach Less than a mile away and a little below them for they still stood high up on the west side of the dale there lay a mere It was long and oval shaped like a great spearhead thrust deep into the northern glen but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky Yet its waters were dark a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamplit room Its face was still and unruffled About it lay a smooth sward shelving down on all sides to its bare unbroken rim There lies the Mirrormere deep Kheledzram said Gimli sadly I remember that he said May you have joy of the sight But we cannot linger there Now long shall I journey ere I have joy again It is I that must hasten away and he that must remain The Company now went down the road from the Gates It was rough and broken fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones But still it could be seen that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the Dwarfkingdom In places there were ruined works of stone beside the path and mounds of green topped with slender birches or firtrees sighing in the wind An eastward bend led them hard by the sward of Mirrormere and there not far from the roadside stood a single column broken at the top That is Durins Stone cried Gimli I cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale Be swift then said Aragorn looking back towards the Gates The Sun sinks early The Orcs will not maybe come out till after dusk but we must be far away before nightfall The Moon is almost spent and it will be dark tonight Come with me Frodo cried the dwarf springing from the road I would not have you go without seeing Kheledzram He ran down the long green slope Frodo followed slowly drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and weariness Sam came up behind Beside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up It was cracked and weatherworn and the faint runes upon its side could not be read This pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in the Mirrormere said the dwarf Let us look ourselves once ere we go They stooped over the dark water At first they could see nothing Then slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound blue and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them beyond there was a space of sky There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars though sunlight was in the sky above Of their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen O Kheledzram fair and wonderful said Gimli There lies the Crown of Durin till he wakes Farewell He bowed and turned away and hastened back up the greensward to the road again What did you see said Pippin to Sam but Sam was too deep in thought to answer The road now turned south and went quickly downwards running out from between the arms of the dale Some way below the mere they came on a deep well of water clear as crystal from which a freshet fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel Here is the spring from which the Silverlode rises said Gimli Do not drink of it It is icy cold Soon it becomes a swift river and it gathers water from many other mountainstreams said Aragorn Our road leads beside it for many miles For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose and first I hope to come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great Riverout yonder They looked as he pointed and before them they could see the stream leaping down to the trough of the valley and then running on and away into the lower lands until it was lost in a golden haze There lie the woods of Lothlrien said Legolas That is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people There are no trees like the trees of that land For in the autumn their leaves fall not but turn to gold Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers and the floor of the wood is golden and golden is the roof and its pillars are of silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey So still our songs in Mirkwood say My heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood and it were springtime My heart will be glad even in the winter said Aragorn But it lies many miles away Let us hasten For some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others but Aragorn was leading them at a great pace and after a while they lagged behind They had eaten nothing since the early morning Sams cut was burning like fire and his head felt light In spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria He shivered Frodo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath At last Legolas turned and seeing them now far behind he spoke to Aragorn The others halted and Aragorn ran back calling to Boromir to come with him I am sorry Frodo he cried full of concern So much has happened this day and we have such need of haste that I have forgotten that you were hurt and Sam too You should have spoken We have done nothing to ease you as we ought though all the orcs of Moria were after us Come now A little further on there is a place where we can rest for a little There I will do what I can for you Come Boromir We will carry them Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the west and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying Silverlode Together they plunged over a fall of greenhued stone and foamed down into a dell About it stood firtrees short and bent and its sides were steep and clothed with hartstongue and shrubs of whortleberry At the bottom there was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles Here they rested It was now nearly three hours after noon and they had come only a few miles from the Gates Already the sun was westering While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush and firwood and drew water Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo Sams wound was not deep but it looked ugly and Aragorns face was grave as he examined it After a moment he looked up with relief Good luck Sam he said Many have received worse than this in payment for the slaying of their first orc The cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orcblades too often are It should heal well when I have tended it Bathe it when Gimli has heated water He opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves They are dry and some of their virtue has one he said but here I have still some of the leaves of _athelas_ that I gathered near Weathertop Crush one in the water and wash the wound clean and I will bind it Now it is your turn Frodo I am all right said Frodo reluctant to have his garments touched AII I needed was some food and a little rest No said Aragorn We must have a look and see what the hammer and the anvil have done to you I still marvel that you are alive at all Gently he stripped off Frodos old jacket and worn tunic and gave a gasp of wonder Then he laughed The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea Carefully he took it off and held it up and the gems on it glittered like stars and the sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of rain in a pool Look my friends he called Heres a pretty hobbitskin to wrap an elvenprinceling in If it were known that hobbits had such hides all the hunters of Middleearth would be riding to the Shire And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain said Gimli gazing at the mail in wonder It is a mithrilcoat Mithril I have never seen or heard tell of one so fair Is this the coat that Gandalf spoke of Then he undervalued it But it was well given I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing so close in his little room said Merry Bless the old hobbit I love him more than ever I hope we get a chance of telling him about it There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodos right side and breast Under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the flesh Frodos left side also was scored and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall While the others set the food ready Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped The pungent fragrance filled the dell and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened Soon Frodo felt the pain leave him and his breath grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side The mail is marvellously light he said Put it on again if you can bear it My heart is glad to know that you have such a coat Do not lay it aside even in sleep unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a while and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts When they had eaten the Company got ready to go on They put out the fire and hid all traces of it Then climbing out of the dell they took to the road again They had not gone far before the sun sank behind the westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountainsides Dusk veiled their feet and mist rose in the hollows Away in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood Sam and Frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair pace and with only one brief halt Aragorn led the Company on for nearly three more hours It was dark Deep night had fallen There were many clear stars hut the fastwaning moon would not be seen till late Gimli and Frodo were at the rear walking softly and not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind At length Gimli broke the silence Not a sound but the wind he said There are no goblins near or my ears are made of wood It is to be hoped that the Orcs will be content with driving us from Moria And maybe that was all their purpose and they had nothing else to do with uswith the Ring Though Orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues into the plain if they have a fallen captain to avenge Frodo did not answer He looked at Sting and the blade was dull Yet he had heard something or thought he had As soon as the shadows had fallen about them and the road behind was dim he had heard again the quick patter of feet Even now he heard it He turned swiftly There were two tiny gleams of light behind or for a moment he thought he saw them but at once they slipped aside and vanished What is it said the dwarf I dont know answered Frodo I thought I heard feet and I thought I saw a lightlike eyes I have thought so often since we first entered Moria Gimli halted and stooped to the ground I hear nothing but the nightspeech of plant and stone he said Come Let us hurry The others are out of sight The nightwind blew chill up the valley to meet them Before them a wide grey shadow loomed and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breeze Lothlrien cried Legolas Lothlrien We have come to the eaves of the Golden Wood Alas that it is winter Under the night the trees stood tall before them arched over the road and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs In the dim light of the stars their stems were grey and their quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold Lothlrien said Aragorn Glad I am to hear again the wind in the trees We are still little more than five leagues from the Gates but we can go no further Here let us hope that the virtue of the Elves will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world said Gimli It is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land whence we wandered in ages long ago said Legolas but we hear that Lrien is not yet deserted for there is a secret power here that holds evil from the land Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell now deep in the woods and far from the northern border Indeed deep in the wood they dwell said Aragorn and sighed as if some memory stirred in him We must fend for ourselves tonight We will go forward a short way until the trees are all about us and then we will turn aside from the path and seek a place to rest in He stepped forward but Boromir stood irresolute and did not follow Is there no other way he said What other fairer way would you desire said Aragorn A plain road though it led through a hedge of swords said Boromir By strange paths has this Company been led and so far to evil fortune Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria to our loss And now we must enter the Golden Wood you say But of that perilous land we have heard in Gondor and it is said that few come out who once go in and of that few none have escaped unscathed Say not _unscathed_ but if you say _unchanged_ then maybe you will speak the truth said Aragorn But lore wanes in Gondor Boromir if in the city of those who once were wise they now speak evil of Lothlrien Believe what you will there is no other way for us unless you would go back to Moriagate or scale the pathless mountains or swim the Great River all alone Then lead on said Boromir But it is perilous Perilous indeed said Aragorn fair and perilous but only evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them Follow me They had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the treeclad slopes that climbed back westward towards the mountains They heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their right Its dark hurrying waters ran across the path before them and joined the Silverlode in a swirl of dim pools among the roots of trees Here is Nimrodel said Legolas Of this stream the Silvan Elves made many songs long ago and still we sing them in the North remembering the rainbow on its falls and the golden flowers that floated in its foam All is dark now and the Bridge of Nimrodel is broken down I will bathe my feet for it is said that the water is healing to the weary He went forward and climbed down the deepcloven bank and stepped into the stream Follow me he cried The water is not deep Let us wade across On the further bank we can rest and the sound of the falling water may bring us sleep and forgetfulness of grief One by one they climbed down and followed Legolas For a moment Frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet It was cold but its touch was clean and as he went on and it mounted to his knees he felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs When all the Company had crossed they sat and rested and ate a little food and Legolas told them tales of Lothlrien that the Elves of Mirkwood still kept in their hearts of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by the Great River before the world was grey At length a silence fell and they heard the music of the waterfall running sweetly in the shadows Almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing mingled with the sound of the water Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel asked Legolas I will sing you a song of the maiden Nimrodel who bore the same name as the stream beside which she lived lung ago It is a fair song in our woodland tongue but this is how it runs in the Westron Speech as some in Rivendell now sing it In a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he began An Elvenmaid there was of old A shining star by day Her mantle white was hemmed with gold Her shoes of silvergrey A star was bound upon her brows A light was on her hair As sun upon the golden boughs In Lrien the fair Her hair was long her limbs were white And fair she was and free And in the wind she went as light As leaf of lindentree Beside the falls of Nimrodel By water clear and cool Her voice as falling silver fell Into the shining pool Where now she wanders none can tell In sunlight or in shade For lost of yore was Nimrodel And in the mountains strayed The elvenship in haven grey Beneath the mountainlee Awaited her for many a day Beside the roaring sea A wind by night in Northern lands Arose and loud it cried And drove the ship from elvenstrands Across the streaming tide When dawn came dim the land was lost The mountains sinking grey Beyond the heaving waves that tossed Their plumes of blinding spray Amroth beheld the fading shore Now low beyond the swell And cursed the faithless ship that bore Him far from Nimrodel Of old he was an Elvenking A lord of tree and glen When golden were the boughs in spring In fair Lothlrien From helm to sea they saw him leap As arrow from the string And dive into the water deep As mew upon the wing The wind was in his flowing hair The foam about him shone Afar they saw him strong and fair Go riding like a swan But from the West has come no word And on the Hither Shore No tidings Elvenfolk have heard Of Amroth evermore The voice of Legolas faltered and the song ceased I cannot sing any more he said That is but a part for I have forgotten much It is long and sad for it tells how sorrow came upon Lothlrien Lrien of the Blossom when the Dwarves awakened evil in the mountains But the Dwarves did not make the evil said Gimli I said not so yet evil came answered Legolas sadly Then many of the Elves of Nimrodels kindred left their dwellings and departed and she was lost far in the South in the passes of the White Mountains and she came not to the ship where Amroth her lover waited for her But in the spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be heard by the falls that bear her name And when the wind is in the South the voice of Amroth comes up from the sea for Nimrodel flows into Silverlode that Elves call Celebrant and Celebrant into Anduin the Great and Anduin flows into the Bay of Belfalas whence the Elves of Lrien set sail But neither Nimrodel nor Amroth ever came back It is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that grew near the falls for that was the custom of the Elves of Lrien to dwell in the trees and maybe it is so still Therefore they were called the Galadhrim the Treepeople Deep in their forest the trees are very great The people of the woods did not delve in the ground like Dwarves nor build strong places of stone before the Shadow came And even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought safer than sitting on the ground said Gimli He looked across the stream to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale and then up into the roof of dark boughs above Your words bring good counsel Gimli said Aragorn We cannot build a house but tonight we will do as the Galadhrim and seek refuge in the treetops if we can We have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise The Company now turned aside from the path and went into the shadow of the deeper woods westward along the mountainstream away from Silverlode Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees some of which overhung the stream Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth but their height could not be guessed I will climb up said Legolas I am at home among trees by root or bough though these trees are of a kind strange to me save as a name in song _Mellyrn_ they are called and are those that bear the yellow blossom but I have never climbed in one I will see now what is their shape and way of growth Whatever it may be said Pippin they will be marvellous trees indeed if they can offer any rest at night except to birds I cannot sleep on a perch Then dig a hole in the ground said Legolas if that is more after the fashion of your kind But you must dig swift and deep if you wish to hide from Orcs He sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch that grew from the trunk high above his head But even as he swung there for a moment a voice spoke suddenly from the treeshadows above him _Daro_ it said in commanding tone and Legolas dropped back to earth in surprise and fear He shrank against the bole of the tree Stand still he whispered to the others Do not move or speak There was a sound of soft laughter over their heads and then another clear voice spoke in an elventongue Frodo could understand little of what was said for the speech that the Silvan folk east of the mountains used among themselves was unlike that of the West Legolas looked up and answered in the same language Who are they and what do they say asked Merry Theyre Elves said Sam Cant you hear their voices Yes they are Elves said Legolas and they say that you breathe so loud that they could shoot you in the dark Sam hastily put his hand over his mouth But they say also that you need have no fear They have been aware of us for a long while They heard my voice across the Nimrodel and knew that I was one of their Northern kindred and therefore they did not hinder our crossing and afterwards they heard my song Now they bid me climb up with Frodo for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journey The others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the foot of the tree until they have decided what is to be done Out of the shadows a ladder was let down it was made of rope silvergrey and glimmering in the dark and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear many men Legolas ran lightly up and Frodo followed slowly behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly The branches of the mallorntree grew out nearly straight from the trunk and then swept upward but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform or _flet_ as such things were called in those days the Elves called it a _talan_ It was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder passed When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated with three other Elves They were clad in shadowygrey and could not be seen among the treestems unless they moved suddenly They stood up and one of them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam He held it up looking at Frodos face and Sams Then he shut off the light again and spoke words of welcome in his elventongue Frodo spoke haltingly in return Welcome the Elf then said again in the Common Language speaking slowly We seldom use any tongue but our own for we dwell now in the heart of the forest and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk Even our own kindred in the North are sundered from us But there are some of us still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our enemies and they speak the languages of other lands I am one Haldir is my name My brothers Rmil and Orophin speak little of your tongue But we have heard rumours of your coming for the messengers of Elrond passed by Lrien on their way home up the Dimrill Stair We had not heard of hobbits or halflings for many a long year and did not know that any yet dwelt in Middleearth You do not look evil And since you come with an Elf of our kindred we are willing to befriend you as Elrond asked though it is not our custom to lead strangers through our land But you must stay here tonight How many are you Eight said Legolas Myself four hobbits and two men one of whom Aragorn is an Elffriend of the folk of Westernesse The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lrien said Haldir and he has the favour of the Lady All then is well But you have yet spoken only of seven The eighth is a dwarf said Legolas A dwarf said Haldir That is not well We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days They are not permitted in our land I cannot allow him to pass But he is from the Lonely Mountain one of Dins trusty people and friendly to Elrond said Frodo Elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions and he has been brave and faithful The Elves spoke together in soft voices and questioned Legolas in their own tongue Very good said Haldir at last We will do this though it is against our liking If Aragorn and Legolas will guard him and answer for him he shall pass but he must go blindfold through Lothlrien But now we must debate no longer Your folk must not remain on the ground We have been keeping watch on the rivers ever since we saw a great troop of Orcs going north toward Moria along the skirts of the mountains many days ago Wolves are howling on the woods borders If you have indeed come from Moria the peril cannot be far behind Tomorrow early you must go on The four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with uswe do not fear them There is another _talan_ in the next tree There the others must take refuge You Legolas must answer to us for them Call us if anything is amiss And have an eye on that dwarf Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldirs message and soon afterwards Merry and Pippin clambered up on to the high flet They were out of breath and seemed rather scared There said Merry panting We have lugged up your blankets as well as our own Strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift of leaves You had no need of your burdens said Haldir It is cold in the treetops in winter though the wind tonight is in the South but we have food and drink to give you that will drive away the nightchill and we have skins and cloaks to spare The hobbits accepted this second and far better supper very gladly Then they wrapped themselves warmly not only in the furcloaks of the Elves but in their own blankets as well and tried to go to sleep But weary as they were only Sam found that easy to do Hobbits do not like heights and do not sleep upstairs even when they have any stairs The flet was not at all to their liking as a bedroom It had no walls not even a rail only on one side was there a light plaited screen which could be moved and fixed in different places according to the wind Pippin went on talking for a while I hope if I do go to sleep in this bedloft that I shant roll off he said Once I do get to sleep said Sam i shall go on sleeping whether I roll off or no And the less said the sooner Ill drop off if you take my meaning Frodo lay for some time awake and looked up at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering leaves Sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes He could dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees speaking in whispers The other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower branches At last lulled by the wind in the boughs above and the sweet murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below Frodo fell asleep with the song of Legolas running in his mind Late in the night he awoke The other hobbits were asleep The Elves were gone The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves The wind was still A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground below There was a ring of metal The sounds died slowly away and seemed to go southward on into the wood A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet Frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a greyhooded Elf He looked towards the hobbits What is it said Frodo _Yrch_ said the Elf in a hissing whisper and cast on to the flet the ropeladder rolled up Orcs said Frodo What are they doing But the Elf had gone There were no more sounds Even the leaves were silent and the very falls seemed to be hushed Frodo sat and shivered in his wraps He was thankful that they had not been caught on the ground but he felt that the trees offered little protection except concealment Orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent it was said but they could also climb He drew out Sting it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded again and grew dull In spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of immediate danger did not leave Frodo rather it grew stronger He got up and crawled to the opening and peered down He was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at the trees foot far below Not Elves for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their movements Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing and something seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the treetrunk He stared down into the dark holding his breath Something was now climbing slowly and its breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeth Then coming up close to the stem Frodo saw two pale eyes They stopped and gazed upward unwinking Suddenly they turned away and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches There was something in this tree that I have never seen before he said It was not an orc It fled as soon as I touched the treestem It seemed to be wary and to have some skill in trees or I might have thought that it was one of you hobbits I did not shoot for I dared not arouse any cries we cannot risk battle A strong company of Orcs has passed They crossed the Nimrodelcurse their foul feet in its clean waterand went on down the old road beside the river They seemed to pick up some scent and they searched the ground for a while near the place where you halted The three of us could not challenge a hundred so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices leading them on into the wood Orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people None of the Orcs will ever return out of Lrien And there will be many Elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls But you must take the road south as soon as it is fully light Day came pale from the East As the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves of the mallorn and it seemed to the hobbits that the early sun of a cool summers morning was shining Paleblue sky peeped among the moving branches Looking through an opening on the south side of the flet Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze The morning was still young and cold when the Company set out again guided now by Haldir and his brother Rmil Farewell sweet Nimrodel cried Legolas Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey treestems Farewell he said It seemed to him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful for ever blending its innumerable notes in an endless changeful music They went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the Silverlode and for some way they followed it southward There were the prints of orcfeet in the earth But soon Haldir turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows There is one of my people yonder across the stream he said though you may not see him He gave a call like the low whistle of a bird and out of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped clad in grey but with his hood thrown back his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun Haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey rope and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the bank Celebrant is already a strong stream here as you see said Haldir and it runs both swift and deep and is very cold We do not set foot in it so far north unless we must But in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges This is how we cross Follow me He made his end of the rope fast about another tree and then ran lightly along it over the river and back again as if he were on a road I can walk this path said Legolas but the others have not this skill Must they swim No said Haldir We have two more ropes We will fasten them above the other one shoulderhigh and another halfhigh and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with care When this slender bridge had been made the Company passed over some cautiously and slowly others more easily Of the hobbits Pippin proved the best for he was surefooted and he walked over quickly holding only with one hand but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down Sam shuffled along clutching hard and looking down into the pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the mountains He breathed with relief when he was safely across Live and learn as my gaffer used to say Though he was thinking of gardening not of roosting like a bird nor of trying to walk like a spider Not even my uncle Andy ever did a trick like that When at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the Silverlode the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them Rmil who had remained on the other side drew back the last one slung it on his shoulder and with a wave of his hand went away back to Nimrodel to keep watch Now friends said Haldir you have entered the Naith of Lrien or the Gore as you would say for it is the land that lies like a spearhead between the arms of Silverlode and Anduin the Great We allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the Naith Few indeed are permitted even to set foot there As was agreed I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf The other may walk free for a while until we come nearer to our dwellings down in Egladil in the Angle between the waters This was not at all to the liking of Gimli The agreement was made without my consent he said I will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoner And I am no spy My folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the Enemy Neither have we done harm to the Elves I am no more likely to betray you than Legolas or any other of my companions I do not doubt you said Haldir Yet this is our law I am not the master of the law and cannot set it aside I have done much in letting you set foot over Celebrant Gimli was obstinate He planted his feet firmly apart and laid his hand upon the haft of his axe I will go forward free he said or I will go back and seek my own land where I am known to be true of word though I perish alone in the wilderness You cannot go back said Haldir sternly Now you have come thus far you must be brought before the Lord and the Lady They shall judge you to hold you or to give you leave as they will You cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass You would be slain before you saw them Gimli drew his axe from his belt Haldir and his companion bent their bows A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks said Legolas Come said Aragorn If I am still to lead this Company you must do as I bid It is hard upon the Dwarf to be thus singled out We will all be blindfold even Legolas That will be best though it will make the journey slow and dull Gimli laughed suddenly A merry troop of fools we shall look Will Haldir lead us all on a string like many blind beggars with one dog But I will be content if only Legolas here shares my blindness I am an Elf and a kinsman here said Legolas becoming angry in his turn Now let us cry a plague on the stiff necks of Elves said Aragorn But the Company shall all fare alike Come bind our eyes Haldir I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe if you do not lead us well said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes You will have no claim said Haldir I shall lead you well and the paths are smooth and straight Alas for the folly of these days said Legolas Here all are enemies of the one Enemy and yet I must walk blind while the sun is merry in the woodland under leaves of gold Folly it may seem said Haldir Indeed in nothing is the power of the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in the world beyond Lothlrien unless maybe in Rivendell that we dare not by our own trust endanger our land We live now upon an island amid many perils and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp The rivers long defended us but they are a sure guard no more for the Shadow has crept northward all about us Some speak of departing yet for that it already seems too late The mountains to the west are growing evil to the east the lands are waste and full of Saurons creatures and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan and the mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy Even if we could come to the shores of the Sea we should find no longer any shelter there It is said that there are still havens of the High Elves but they are far north and west beyond the land of the Halflings But where that may be though the Lord and Lady may know I do not You ought at least to guess since you have seen us said Merry There are Elfhavens west of my land the Shire where Hobbits live Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea said Haldir It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it yet still we remember it in song Tell me of these havens as we walk I cannot said Merry I have never seen them I have never been out of my own land before And if I had known what the world outside was like I dont think I should have had the heart to leave it Not even to see fair Lothlrien said Haldir The world is indeed full of peril and in it there are many dark places but still there is much that is fair and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief it grows perhaps the greater Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back and peace shall come again Yet I do not believe that the world about us will ever again be as it was of old or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime For the Elves I fear it will prove at best a truce in which they may pass to the Sea unhindered and leave the Middleearth for ever Alas for Lothlrien that I love It would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn grew But if there are mallorntrees beyond the Great Sea none have reported it As they spoke thus the Company filed slowly along the paths in the wood led by Haldir while the other Elf walked behind They felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft and after a while they walked more freely without fear of hurt or fall Being deprived of sight Frodo found his hearing and other senses sharpened He could smell the trees and the trodden grass He could hear many different notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead the river murmuring away on his right and the thin clear voices of birds in the sky He felt the sun upon his face and hands when they passed through an open glade As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him and it deepened as he walked on into the Naith it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the Elder Days and was now walking in a world that was no more In Rivendell there was memory of ancient things in Lrien the ancient things still lived on in the waking world Evil had been seen and heard there sorrow had been known the Elves feared and distrusted the world outside wolves were howling on the woods borders but on the land of Lrien no shadow lay All that day the Company marched on until they felt the cool evening come and heard the early nightwind whispering among many leaves Then they rested and slept without fear upon the ground for their guides would not permit them to unbind their eyes and they could not climb In the morning they went on again walking without haste At noon they halted and Frodo was aware that they had passed out under the shining Sun Suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around him A marching host of Elves had come up silently they were hastening toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria and they brought news some of which Haldir reported The marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains and were being pursued A strange creature also had been seen running with bent back and with hands near the ground like a beast and yet not of beastshape It had eluded capture and they had not shot it not knowing whether it was good or ill and it had vanished down the Silverlode southward Also said Haldir they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim You are all to walk free even the dwarf Gimli It seems that the Lady knows who and what is each member of your Company New messages have come from Rivendell perhaps He removed the bandage first from Gimlis eyes Your pardon he said bowing low Look on us now with friendly eyes Look and be glad for you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the Naith of Lrien since Durins Day When his eyes were in turn uncovered Frodo looked up and caught his breath They were standing in an open space To the left stood a great mound covered with a sward of grass as green as Springtime in the Elder Days Upon it as a double crown grew two circles of trees the outer had bark of snowy white and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness the inner were mallorntrees of great height still arrayed in pale gold High amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet At the feet of the trees and all about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars Among them nodding on slender stalks were other flowers white and palest green they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass Over all the sky was blue and the sun of afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees Behold You are come to Cerin Amroth said Haldir For this is the heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago and here is the mound of Amroth where in happier days his high house was built Here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass the yellow _elanor_ and the pale _niphredil_ Here we will stay awhile and come to the city of the Galadhrim at dusk The others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass but Frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder It seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world A light was upon it for which his language had no name All that he saw was shapely but the shapes seemed at once clear cut as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes and ancient as if they had endured for ever He saw no colour but those he knew gold and white and blue and green but they were fresh and poignant as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful In winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring No blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth On the land of Lrien there was no stain He turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him looking round with a puzzled expression and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake Its sunlight and bright day right enough he said I thought that Elves were all for moon and stars but this is more elvish than anything I ever heard tell of I feel as if I was _inside_ a song if you take my meaning Haldir looked at them and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both thought and word He smiled You feel the power of the Lady of the Galadhrim he said Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth They followed him as he stepped lightly up the grassclad slopes Though he walked and breathed and about him living leaves and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face Frodo felt that he was in a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness When he had gone and passed again into the outer world still Frodo the wanderer from the Shire would walk there upon the grass among _elanor_ and _niphredil_ in fair Lothlrien They entered the circle of white trees As they did so the South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth and sighed among the branches Frodo stood still hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away and seabirds crying whose race had perished from the earth Haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet As Frodo prepared to follow him he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a trees skin and of the life within it He felt a delight in wood and the touch of it neither as forester nor as carpenter it was the delight of the living tree itself As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform Haldir took his hand and turned him toward the South Look this way first he said Frodo looked and saw still at some distance a hill of many mighty trees or a city of green towers which it was he could not tell Out of it it seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in sway He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city Then he looked eastward and saw all the land of Lrien running down to the pale gleam of Anduin the Great River He lifted his eyes across the river and all the light went out and he was back again in the world he knew Beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty formless and vague until far away it rose again like a wall dark and drear The sun that lay on Lothlrien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood said Haldir It is clad in a forest of dark fir where the trees strive one against another and their branches rot and wither In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol Guldur where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling We fear that now it is inhabited again and with power sevenfold A black cloud lies often over it of late In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one to another and ever they strive now in thought but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness its own secret has not been discovered Not yet He turned and climbed swiftly down and they followed him At the hills foot Frodo found Aragorn standing still and silent as a tree but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor and a light was in his eyes He was wrapped in some fair memory and as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn and he seemed clothed in white a young lord tall and fair and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see_ Arwen vanimelda namri_ he said and then he drew a breath and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and smiled Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth he said and here my heart dwells ever unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread you and I Come with me And taking Frodos hand in his he left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man _Chapter 7_ The Mirror of Galadriel The sun was sinking behind the mountains and the shadows were deepening in the woods when they went on again Their paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered Night came beneath the trees as they walked and the Elves uncovered their silver lamps Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars There was a wide treeless space before them running in a great circle and bending away on either hand Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow but the grass upon its brink was green as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone Upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorntrees taller than any they had yet seen in all the land Their height could not be guessed but they stood up in the twilight like living towers In their manytiered branches and amid their evermoving leaves countless lights were gleaming green and gold and silver Haldir turned towards the Company Welcome to Caras Galadhon he said Here is the city of the Galadhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady of Lrien But we cannot enter here for the gates do not look northward We must go round to the southern side and the way is not short for the city is great There was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of the fosse Along this they went westward with the city ever climbing up like a green cloud upon their left and as the night deepened more lights sprang forth until all the hill seemed afire with stars They came at last to a white bridge and crossing found the great gates of the city they faced southwest set between the ends of the encircling wall that here overlapped and they were tall and strong and hung with many lamps Haldir knocked and spoke and the gates opened soundlessly but of guards Frodo could see no sign The travellers passed within and the gates shut behind them They were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall and passing quickly through it they entered the City of the Trees No folk could they see nor hear any feet upon the paths but there were many voices about them and in the air above Far away up on the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves They went along many paths and climbed many stairs until they came to the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering It was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees and it fell into a basin of silver from which a white stream spilled Upon the south side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk and up it towered until its first branches far above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves Beside it a broad white ladder stood and at its foot three Elves were seated They sprang up as the travellers approached and Frodo saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail and from their shoulders hung long white cloaks Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel said Haldir It is their wish that you should ascend and speak with them One of the Elfwardens then blew a clear note on a small horn and it was answered three times from far above I will go first said Haldir Let Frodo come next and with him Legolas The others may follow as they wish It is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs but you may rest upon the way As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets some on one side some on another and some set about the bole of the tree so that the ladder passed through them At a great height above the ground he came to a wide _talan_ like the deck of a great ship On it was built a house so large that almost it would have served for a hall of Men upon the earth He entered behind Haldir and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape in the midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn now tapering towards its crown and yet making still a pillar of wide girth The chamber was filled with a soft light its walls were green and silver and its roof of gold Many Elves were seated there On two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat side by side Celeborn and Galadriel They stood up to greet their guests after the manner of Elves even those who were accounted mighty kings Very tall they were and the Lady no less tall than the Lord and they were grave and beautiful They were clad wholly in white and the hair of the Lady was of deep gold and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright but no sign of age was upon them unless it were in the depths of their eyes for these were keen as lances in the starlight and yet profound the wells of deep memory Haldir led Frodo before them and the Lord welcomed him in his own tongue The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face Sit now beside my chair Frodo of the Shire said Celeborn When all have come we will speak together Each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered Welcome Aragorn son of Arathorn he said It is eight and thirty years of the world outside since you came to this land and those years lie heavy on you But the end is near for good or ill Here lay aside your burden for a while Welcome son of Thranduil Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the North Welcome Gimli son of Glin It is long indeed since we saw one of Durins folk in Caras Galadhon But today we have broken our long law May it be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand and that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples Gimli bowed low When all the guests were seated before his chair the Lord looked at them again Here there are eight he said Nine were to set out so said the messages But maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have not heard Elrond is far away and darkness gathers between us and all this year the shadows have grown longer Nay there was no change of counsel said the Lady Galadriel speaking for the first time Her voice was clear and musical but deeper than womans wont Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company but he did not pass the borders of this land Now tell us where he is for I much desired to speak with him again But I cannot see him from afar unless he comes within the fences of Lothlrien a grey mist is about him and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden from me Alas said Aragorn Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow He remained in Moria and did not escape At these words all the Elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and amazement These are evil tidings said Celeborn the most evil that have been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds He turned to Haldir Why has nothing of this been told to me before he asked in the Elventongue We have not spoken to Haldir of our deeds or our purpose said Legolas At first we were weary and danger was too close behind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time as we walked in gladness on the fair paths of Lrien Yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended said Frodo Gandalf was our guide and he led us through Moria and when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us and he fell Tell us now the full tale said Celeborn Then Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of Caradhras and in the days that followed and he spoke of Balin and his book and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul and the fire and the narrow bridge and the coming of the Terror An evil of the Ancient World it seemed such as I have never seen before said Aragorn It was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible It was a Balrog of Morgoth said Legolas of all elfbanes the most deadly save the One who sits in the Dark Tower Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams I saw Durins Bane said Gimli in a low voice and dread was in his eyes Alas said Celeborn We long have feared that under Caradhras a terror slept But had I known that the Dwarves had stirred up this evil in Moria again I would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders you and all that went with you And if it were possible one would say that at the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly going needlessly into the net of Moria He would be rash indeed that said that thing said Galadriel gravely Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life Those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose But however it may be with the guide the followers are blameless Do not repent of your welcome to the Dwarf If our folk had been exiled long and far from Lothlrien who of the Galadhrim even Celeborn the Wise would pass nigh and would not wish to look upon their ancient home though it had become an abode of dragons Dark is the water of Kheledzram and cold are the springs of Kibilnla and fair were the manypillared halls of Khazaddm in Elder Days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone She looked upon Gimli who sat glowering and sad and she smiled And the Dwarf hearing the names given in his own ancient tongue looked up and met her eyes and it seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding Wonder came into his face and then he smiled in answer He rose clumsily and bowed in dwarffashion saying Yet more fair is the living land of Lrien and the Lady Galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the earth There was a silence At length Celeborn spoke again I did not know that your plight was so evil he said Let Gimli forget my harsh words I spoke in the trouble of my heart I will do what I can to aid you each according to his wish and need but especially that one of the little folk who bears the burden Your quest is known to us said Galadriel looking at Frodo But we will not here speak of it more openly Yet not in vain will it prove maybe that you came to this land seeking aid as Gandalf himself plainly purposed For the Lord of the Galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of Middleearth and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings He has dwelt in the West since the days of dawn and I have dwelt with him years uncounted for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the mountains and together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat I it was who first summoned the White Council And if my designs had not gone amiss it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise But even now there is hope left I will not give you counsel saying do this or do that For not in doing or contriving nor in choosing between this course and another can I avail but only in knowing what was and is and in part also what shall be But this I will say to you your Quest stands upon the edge of a knife Stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all Yet hope remains while all the Company is true And with that word she held them with her eyes and in silence looked searchingly at each of them in turn None save Legolas and Aragorn could long endure her glance Sam quickly blushed and hung his head At length the Lady Galadriel released them from her eyes and she smiled Do not let your hearts be troubled she said Tonight you shall sleep in peace Then they sighed and felt suddenly weary as those who have been questioned long and deeply though no words had been spoken openly Go now said Celeborn You are worn with sorrow and much toil Even if your Quest did not concern us closely you should have refuge in this City until you were healed and refreshed Now you shall rest and we will not speak of your further road for a while That night the Company slept upon the ground much to the satisfaction of the hobbits The Elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the fountain and in it they laid soft couches then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left them For a little while the travellers talked of their night before in the treetops and of their days journey and of the Lord and Lady for they had not yet the heart to look further back What did you blush for Sam said Pippin You soon broke down Anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience I hope it was nothing worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets I never thought no such thing answered Sam in no mood for jest If you want to know I felt as if I hadnt got nothing on and I didnt like it She seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what I would do if she gave me the chance of flying back home to the Shire to a nice little hole withwith a bit of garden of my own Thats funny said Merry Almost exactly what I felt myself only only well I dont think III say any more he ended lamely All of them it seemed had fared alike each had felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead and something that he greatly desired clear before his mind it lay and to get it he had only to turn aside from the road and leave the Quest and the war against Sauron to others And it seemed to me too said Gimli that my choice would remain secret and known only to myself To me it seemed exceedingly strange said Boromir Maybe it was only a test and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose but almost I should have said that she was tempting us and offering what she pretended to have the power to give It need not be said that I refused to listen The Men of Minas Tirith are true to their word But what he thought that the Lady had offered him Boromir did not tell And as for Frodo he would not speak though Boromir pressed him with questions She held you long in her gaze Ringbearer he said Yes said Frodo but whatever came into my mind then I will keep there Well have a care said Boromir I do not feel too sure of this Elvish Lady and her purposes Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel said Aragorn sternly You know not what you say There is in her and in this land no evil unless a man bring it hither himself Then let him beware But tonight I shall sleep without fear for the first time since I left Rivendell And may I sleep deep and forget for a while my grief I am weary in body and in heart He cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep The others soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber When they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun They remained some days in Lothlrien so far as they could tell or remember All the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear save for a gentle rain that fell at times and passed away leaving all things fresh and clean The air was cool and soft as if it were early spring yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter It seemed to them that they did little but eat and drink and rest and walk among the trees and it was enough They had not seen the Lord and Lady again and they had little speech with the Elvenfolk for few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue Haldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the North where great watch was now kept since the tidings of Moria that the Company had brought Legolas was away much among the Galadhrim and after the first night he did not sleep with the other companions though he returned to eat and talk with them Often he took Gimli with him when he went abroad in the land and the others wondered at this change Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf and all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds As they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew more keen Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing and knew that they were making songs of lamentation for his fall for they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not understand _Mithrandir Mithrandir_ sang the Elves _O Pilgrim Grey_For so they loved to call him But if Legolas was with the Company he would not interpret the songs for them saying that he had not the skill and that for him the grief was still too near a matter for tears and not yet for song It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words He was seldom moved to make song or rhyme even in Rivendell he had listened and had not sung himself though his memory was stored with many things that others had made before him But now as he sat beside the fountain in Lrien and heard about him the voices of the Elves his thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to him yet when he tried to repeat it to Sam only snatches remained faded as a handful of withered leaves When evening in the Shire was grey his footsteps on the Hill were heard before the dawn he went away on journey long without a word From Wilderland to Western shore from northern waste to southern hill through dragonlair and hidden door and darkling woods he walked at will With Dwarf and Hobbit Elves and Men with mortal and immortal folk with bird on bough and beast in den in their own secret tongues he spoke A deadly sword a healing hand a back that bent beneath its load a trumpetvoice a burning brand a weary pilgrim on the road A lord of wisdom throned he sat swift in anger quick to laugh an old man in a battered hat who leaned upon a thorny staff He stood upon the bridge alone and Fire and Shadow both defied his staff was broken on the stone in Khazaddm his wisdom died Why youll be beating Mr Bilbo next said Sam No I am afraid not said Frodo But that is the best I can do yet Well Mr Frodo if you do have another go I hope youll say a word about his fireworks said Sam Something like this The finest rockets ever seen they burst in stars of blue and green or after thunder golden showers came falling like a rain of flowers Though that doesnt do them justice by a long road No Ill leave that to you Sam Or perhaps to Bilbo Butwell I cant talk of it any more I cant bear to think of bringing the news to him One evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool twilight Both of them felt restless again On Frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave Lothlrien What do you think of Elves now Sam he said I asked you the same question once beforeit seems a very long while ago but you have seen more of them since then I have indeed said Sam And I reckon theres Elves and Elves Theyre all elvish enough but theyre not all the same Now these folk arent wanderers or homeless and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us they seem to belong here more even than Hobbits do in the Shire Whether theyve made the land or the lands made them its hard to say if you take my meaning Its wonderfully quiet here Nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems to want it to If theres any magic about its right down deep where I cant lay my hands on it in a manner of speaking You can see and feel it everywhere said Frodo Well said Sam you cant see nobody working it No fireworks like poor Gandalf used to show I wonder we dont see nothing of the Lord and Lady in all these days I fancy now that _she_ could do some wonderful things if she had a mind Id dearly love to see some Elfmagic Mr Frodo I wouldnt said Frodo I am content And I dont miss Gandalfs fireworks but his bushy eyebrows and his quick temper and his voice Youre right said Sam And dont think Im finding fault Ive often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales but Ive never heard of a better land than this Its like being at home and on a holiday at the same time if you understand me I dont want to leave All the same Im beginning to feel that if weve got to go on then wed best get it over _Its the job thats never started as takes longest to finish_ as my old gaffer used to say And I dont reckon that these folk can do much more to help us magic or no Its when we leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse Im thinking I am afraid thats only too true Sam said Frodo Yet I hope very much that before we leave we shall see the Lady of the Elves again Even as he spoke they saw as if she came in answer to their words the Lady Galadriel approaching Tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees She spoke no word but beckoned to them Turning aside she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of Caras Galadhon and passing through a high green hedge they came into an enclosed garden No trees grew there and it lay open to the sky The evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western woods Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into a deep green hollow through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hill At the bottom upon a low pedestal carved like a branching tree stood a basin of silver wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver ewer With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim and breathed on it and when the water was still again she spoke Here is the Mirror of Galadriel she said I have brought you here so that you may look in it if you will The air was very still and the dell was dark and the Elflady beside him was tall and pale What shall we look for and what shall we see asked Frodo filled with awe Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal she answered and to some I can show what they desire to see But the Mirror will also show things unbidden and those are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold What you will see if you leave the Mirror free to work I cannot tell For it shows things that were and things that are things that yet may be But which it is that he sees even the wisest cannot always tell Do you wish to look Frodo did not answer And you she said turning to Sam For this is what your folk would call magic I believe though I do not understand clearly what they mean and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy But this if you will is the magic of Galadriel Did you not say that you wished to see Elfmagic I did said Sam trembling a little between fear and curiosity Ill have a peep Lady if youre willing And Id not mind a glimpse of whats going on at home he said in an aside to Frodo It seems a terrible long time that Ive been away But there like as not Ill only see the stars or something that I wont understand Like as not said the Lady with a gentle laugh But come you shall look and see what you may Do not touch the water Sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin The water looked hard and dark Stars were reflected in it Theres only stars as I thought he said Then he gave a low gasp for the stars went out As if a dark veil had been withdrawn the Mirror grew grey and then clear There was sun shining and the branches of trees were waving and tossing in the wind But before Sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw the light faded and now he thought he saw Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff Then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage and climbing an endless winding stair It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something but what it was he did not know Like a dream the vision shifted and went back and he saw the trees again But this time they were not so close and he could see what was going on they were not waving in the wind they were falling crashing to the ground Hi cried Sam in an outraged voice Theres that Ted Sandyman acutting down trees as he shouldnt They didnt ought to be felled its that avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to Bywater I wish I could get at Ted and Id fell _him_ But now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished and a large redbrick building was being put up where it had stood Lots of folk were busily at work There was a tall red chimney nearby Black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the Mirror Theres some devilry at work in the Shire he said Elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to send Mr Merry back Then suddenly Sam gave a cry and sprang away I cant stay here he said wildly I must go home Theyve dug up Bagshot Row and theres the poor old gaffer going down the Hill with his bits of things on a barrow I must go home You cannot go home alone said the Lady You did not wish to go home without your master before you looked in the Mirror and yet you knew that evil things might well be happening in the Shire Remember that the Mirror shows many things and not all have yet come to pass Some never come to be unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent them The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands I wish I had never come here and I dont want to see no more magic he said and fell silent After a moment he spoke again thickly as if struggling with tears No Ill go home by the long road with Mr Frodo or not at all he said But I hope I do get back some day If what Ive seen turns out true somebodys going to catch it hot Do you now wish to look Frodo said the Lady Galadriel You did not wish to see Elfmagic and were content Do you advise me to look asked Frodo No she said I do not counsel you one way or the other I am not a counsellor You may learn something and whether what you see be fair or evil that may be profitable and yet it may not Seeing is both good and perilous Yet I think Frodo that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture or I would not have brought you here Do as you will I will look said Frodo and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water At once the Mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land Mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky A long grey road wound back out of sight Far away a figure came slowly down the road faint and small at first but growing larger and clearer as it approached Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf He almost called aloud the wizards name and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but in white in a white that shone faintly in the dusk and in its hand there was a white staff The head was so bowed that he could see no face and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the Mirrors view Doubt came into Frodos mind was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago or was it Saruman The vision now changed Brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about his room The table was littered with disordered papers rain was beating on the windows Then there was a pause and after it many swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involved The mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at once the Sea Darkness fell The sea rose and raged in a great storm Then he saw against the Sun sinking bloodred into a wrack of clouds the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of the West Then a wide river flowing through a populous city Then a white fortress with seven towers And then again a ship with black sails but now it was morning again and the water rippled with light and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun A smoke as of fire and battle arose and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey mist and into the mist a small ship passed away twinkling with lights It vanished and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight and Frodo looked into emptiness In the black abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew until it filled nearly all the Mirror So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze The Eye was rimmed with fire but was itself glazed yellow as a cats watchful and intent and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing Then the Eye began to rove searching this way and that and Frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was one But he also knew that it could not see himnot yet not unless he willed it The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy heavier than a great stone and his head was dragged downwards The Mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the water He was slipping forward Do not touch the water said the Lady Galadriel softly The vision faded and Frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin He stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady I know what it was that you last saw she said for that is also in my mind Do not be afraid But do not think that only by singing amid the trees nor even by the slender arrows of elvenbows is this land of Lothlrien maintained and defended against its Enemy I say to you Frodo that even as I speak to you I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind or all of his mind that concerns the Elves And he gropes ever to see me and my thought But still the door is closed She lifted up her white arms and spread out her hands towards the East in a gesture of rejection and denial Erendil the Evening Star most beloved of the Elves shone clear above So bright was it that the figure of the Elvenlady cast a dim shadow on the ground Its rays glanced upon a ring about her finger it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Evenstar had come down to rest upon her hand Frodo gazed at the ring with awe for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood Yes she said divining his thought it is not permitted to speak of it and Elrond could not do so But it cannot be hidden from the Ringbearer and one who has seen the Eye Verily it is in the land of Lrien upon the finger of Galadriel that one of the Three remains This is Nenya the Ring of Adamant and I am its keeper He suspects but he does not know not yet Do you not see now wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of Doom For if you fail then we are laid bare to the Enemy Yet if you succeed then our power is diminished and Lothlrien will fade and the tides of Time will sweep it away We must depart into the West or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be forgotten Frodo bent his head And what do you wish he said at last That what should be shall be she answered The love of the Elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea and their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged Yet they will cast all away rather than submit to Sauron for they know him now For the fate of Lothlrien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own task Yet I could wish were it of any avail that the One Ring had never been wrought or had remained for ever lost You are wise and fearless and fair Lady Galadriel said Frodo I will give you the One Ring if you ask for it It is too great a matter for me Galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh Wise the Lady Galadriel may be she said yet here she has met her match in courtesy Gently are you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting You begin to see with a keen eye I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer For many long years I had pondered what I might do should the Great Ring come into my hands and behold it was brought within my grasp The evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways whether Sauron himself stands or falls Would not that have been a noble deed to set to the credit of his Ring if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest And now at last it comes You will give me the Ring freely In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen And I shall not be dark but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning Stronger than the foundations of the earth All shall love me and despair She lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark She stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement and beautiful beyond enduring terrible and worshipful Then she let her hand fall and the light faded and suddenly she laughed again and lo she was shrunken a slender elfwoman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad I pass the test she said I will diminish and go into the West and remain Galadriel They stood for a long while in silence At length the Lady spoke again Let us return she said In the morning you must depart for now we have chosen and the tides of fate are flowing I would ask one thing before we go said Frodo a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell I am permitted to wear the One Ring why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear them You have not tried she said Only thrice have you set the Ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed Do not try It would destroy you Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor Before you could use that power you would need to become far stronger and to train your will to the domination of others Yet even so as Ringbearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden your sight is grown keener You have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise You saw the Eye of him that holds the Seven and the Nine And did you not see and recognize the ring upon my finger Did you see my ring she asked turning again to Sam No Lady he answered To tell you the truth I wondered what you were talking about I saw a star through your finger But if youll pardon my speaking out I think my master was right I wish youd take his Ring Youd put things to rights Youd stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him adrift Youd make some folk pay for their dirty work I would she said That is how it would begin But it would not stop with that alas We will not speak more of it Let us go _Chapter 8_ Farewell to Lrien That night the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn and there the Lord and Lady greeted them with fair words At length Celeborn spoke of their departure Now is the time he said when those who wish to continue the Quest must harden their hearts to leave this land Those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here for a while But whether they stay or go none can be sure of peace For we are come now to the edge of doom Here those who wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world lie open again or we summon them to the last need of Lrien Then they may return to their own lands or else go to the long home of those that fall in battle There was a silence They all resolved to go forward said Galadriel looking in their eyes As for me said Boromir my way home lies onward and not back That is true said Celeborn but is all this Company going with you to Minas Tirith We have not decided our course said Aragorn Beyond Lothlrien I do not know what Gandalf intended to do Indeed I do not think that even he had any clear purpose Maybe not said Celeborn yet when you leave this land you can no longer forget the Great River As some of you know well it cannot be crossed by travellers with baggage between Lrien and Gondor save by boat And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken down and all the landings held now by the Enemy On which side will you journey The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this side upon the west but the straight road of the Quest lies east of the River upon the darker shore Which shore will you now take If my advice is heeded it will be the western shore and the way to Minas Tirith answered Boromir But I am not the leader of the Company The others said nothing and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled I see that you do not yet know what to do said Celeborn It is not my part to choose for you but I will help you as I may There are some among you who can handle boats Legolas whose folk know the swift Forest River and Boromir of Gondor and Aragorn the traveller And one Hobbit cried Merry Not all of us look on boats as wild horses My people live by the banks of the Brandywine That is well said Celeborn Then I will furnish your Company with boats They must be small and light for if you go far by water there are places where you will be forced to carry them You will come to the rapids of Sarn Gebir and maybe at last to the great falls of Rauros where the River thunders down from Nen Hithoel and there are other perils Boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while Yet they will not give you counsel in the end you must leave them and the River and turn westor east Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times The gift of boats comforted him much not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for some days The others too looked more hopeful Whatever perils lay ahead it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to plod forward with bent backs Only Sam was doubtful he at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses or worse and not all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of them All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon tomorrow said Celeborn I will send my people to you in the morning to help you make ready for the journey Now we will wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleep Good night my friends said Galadriel Sleep in peace Do not trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight Maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet though you do not see them Good night The Company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion Legolas went with them for this was to be their last night in Lothlrien and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together For a long time they debated what they should do and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring but they came to no decision It was plain that most of them desired to go first to Minas Tirith and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the shadow of Mordor but Frodo spoke no word and Aragorn was still divided in his mind His own plan while Gandalf remained with them had been to go with Boromir and with his sword help to deliver Gondor For he believed that the message of the dreams was a summons and that the hour had come at last when the heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for the mastery But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him and he knew that he could not now forsake the Ring if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir And yet what help could he or any of the Company give to Frodo save to walk blindly with him into the darkness I shall go to Minas Tirith alone if need be for it is my duty said Boromir and after that he was silent for a while sitting with his eyes fixed on Frodo as if he was trying to read the Halflings thoughts At length he spoke again softly as if he was debating with himself If you wish only to destroy the Ring he said then there is little use in war and weapons and the Men of Minas Tirith cannot help But if you wish to destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord then it is folly to go without force into his domain and folly to throw away He paused suddenly as if he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud It would be folly to throw lives away I mean he ended It is a choice between defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death At least that is how I see it Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromirs glance and he looked hard at him Plainly Boromirs thought was different from his final words It would be folly to throw away what The Ring of Power He had said something like this at the Council but then he had accepted the correction of Elrond Frodo looked at Aragorn but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded Boromirs words And so their debate ended Merry and Pippin were already asleep and Sam was nodding The night was growing old In the morning as they were beginning to pack their slender goods Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside and inside was the colour of cream Gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye _Cram_ he said under his breath as he broke off a crisp corner and nibbled at it His expression quickly changed and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish No more no more cried the Elves laughing You have eaten enough already for a long days march I thought it was only a kind of _cram_ such as the Dalemen make for journeys in the wild said the Dwarf So it is they answered But we call it _lembas_ or waybread and it is more strengthening than any food made by Men and it is more pleasant than _cram_ by all accounts Indeed it is said Gimli Why it is better than the honeycakes of the Beornings and that is great praise for the Beornings are the best bakers that I know of but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in these days You are kindly hosts All the same we bid you spare the food they said Eat little at a time and only at need For these things are given to serve you when all else fails The cakes will keep sweet for many many days if they are unbroken and left in their leafwrappings as we have brought them One will keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes they had brought For each they had provided a hood and cloak made according to his size of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim wove It was hard to say of what colour they were grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be and yet if they were moved or set in another light they were green as shadowed leaves or brown as fallow fields by night dusksilver as water under the stars Each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver Are these magic cloaks asked Pippin looking at them with wonder I do not know what you mean by that answered the leader of the Elves They are fair garments and the web is good for it was made in this land They are elvish robes certainly if that is what you mean Leaf and branch water and stone they have the hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of Lrien that we love for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make Yet they are garments not armour and they will not turn shaft or blade But they should serve you well they are light to wear and warm enough or cool enough at need And you will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes whether you walk among the stones or the trees You are indeed high in the favour of the Lady For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people After their morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn by the fountain Their hearts were heavy for it was a fair place and it had become like home to them though they could not count the days and nights that they had passed there As they stood for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass of the glade Frodo greeted him with delight I have returned from the Northern Fences said the Elf and I am sent now to be your guide again The Dimrill Dale is full of vapour and clouds of smoke and the mountains are troubled There are noises in the deeps of the earth If any of you had thought of returning northwards to your homes you would not have been able to pass that way But come Your path now goes south As they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty but in the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing They themselves went silently At last Haldir led them down the southward slopes of the hill and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps and to the white bridge and so they passed out and left the city of the Elves Then they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorntrees and passed on winding through rolling woodlands of silver shadow leading them ever down southwards and eastwards towards the shores of the River They had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high green wall Passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the trees Before them lay a long lawn of shining grass studded with golden _elanor_ that glinted in the sun The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins on the right and west the Silverlode flowed glittering on the left and east the Great River rolled its broad waters deep and dark On the further shores the woodlands still marched on southwards as far as the eye could see but all the banks were bleak and bare No mallorn lifted its goldhung boughs beyond the Land of Lrien On the bank of the Silverlode at some distance up from the meeting of the streams there was a hythe of white stones and white wood By it were moored many boats and barges Some were brightly painted and shone with silver and gold and green but most were either white or grey Three small grey boats had been made ready for the travellers and in these the Elves stowed their goods And they added also coils of rope three to each boat Slender they looked but strong silken to the touch grey of hue like the elvencloaks What are these asked Sam handling one that lay upon the greensward Ropes indeed answered an Elf from the boats Never travel far without a rope And one that is long and strong and light Such are these They may be a help in many needs You dont need to tell me that said Sam I came without any and Ive been worried ever since But I was wondering what these were made of knowing a bit about ropemaking its in the family as you might say They are made of _hithlain_ said the Elf but there is no time now to instruct you in the art of their making Had we known that this craft delighted you we could have taught you much But now alas unless you should at some time return hither you must be content with our gift May it serve you well Come said Haldir All is now ready for you Enter the boats But take care at first Heed the words said the other Elves These boats are lightbuilt and they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk They will not sink lade them as you will but they are wayward if mishandled It would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out here where there is a landingplace before you set off downstream The Company was arranged in this way Aragorn Frodo and Sam were in one boat Boromir Merry and Pippin in another and in the third were Legolas and Gimli who had now become fast friends In this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed The boats were moved and steered with shorthandled paddles that had broad leafshaped blades When all was ready Aragorn led them on a trial up the Silverlode The current was swift and they went forward slowly Sam sat in the bows clutching the sides and looking back wistfully to the shore The sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyes As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue the trees drew down to the rivers brink Here and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream The air was very bright and still and there was a silence except for the high distant song of larks They turned a sharp bend in the river and there sailing proudly down the stream toward them they saw a swan of great size The water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck Its beak shone like burnished gold and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones its huge white wings were half lifted A music came down the river as it drew nearer and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship wrought and carved with elvenskill in the likeness of a bird Two elves clad in white steered it with black paddles In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn and behind him stood Galadriel tall and white a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair and in her hand she held a harp and she sang Sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in the cool clear air I sang of leaves of leaves of gold and leaves of gold there grew Of wind I sang a wind there came and in the branches blew Beyond the Sun beyond the Moon the foam was on the Sea And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree Beneath the stars of Evereve in Eldamar it shone In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elventears O Lrien The Winter comes the bare and leafless Day The leaves are falling in the stream the River flows away O Lrien Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor But if of ships I now should sing what ship would come to me What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea Aragorn stayed his boat as the Swanship drew alongside The Lady ended her song and greeted them We have come to bid you our last farewell she said and to speed you with blessings from our land Though you have been our guests said Celeborn you have not yet eaten with us and we bid you therefore to a parting feast here between the flowing waters that will bear you far from Lrien The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe and they turned their boats and followed it There in the last end of Egladil upon the green grass the parting feast was held but Frodo ate and drank little heeding only the beauty of the Lady and her voice She seemed no longer perilous or terrible nor filled with hidden power Already she seemed to him as by men of later days Elves still at times are seen present and yet remote a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of Time After they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass Celeborn spoke to them again of their journey and lifting his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the Tongue As you go down the water he said you will find that the trees will fail and you will come to a barren country There the River flows in stony vale amid high moors until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall island of the Tindrock that we call Tol Brandir There it casts its arms about the steep shores of the isle and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf the Wetwang as it is called in your tongue That is a wide region of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and much divided There the Entwash flows in by many mouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west About that stream on this side of the Great River lies Rohan On the further side are the bleak hills of the Emyn Muil The wind blows from the East there for they look out over the Dead Marshes and the Nomanlands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of Mordor Boromir and any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith will do well to leave the Great River above Rauros and cross the Entwash before it finds the marshes Yet they should not go too far up that stream nor risk becoming entangled in the Forest of Fangorn That is a strange land and is now little known But Boromir and Aragorn doubtless do not need this warning Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith said Boromir But what I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives tales such as we tell to our children All that lies north of Rohan is now to us so far away that fancy can wander freely there Of old Fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it to prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years I have myself been at whiles in Rohan but I have never crossed it northwards When I was sent out as a messenger I passed through the Gap by the skirts of the White Mountains and crossed the Isen and the Greyflood into Northerland A long and wearisome journey Four hundred leagues I reckoned it and it took me many months for I lost my horse at Tharbad at the fording of the Greyflood After that journey and the road I have trodden with this Company I do not much doubt that I shall find a way through Rohan and Fangorn too if need be Then I need say no more said Celeborn But do not despise the lore that has come down from distant years for oft it may chance that old wives keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know Now Galadriel rose from the grass and taking a cup from one of her maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell she said Drink Lord of the Galadhrim And let not your heart be sad though night must follow noon and already our evening draweth nigh Then she brought the cup to each of the Company and bade them drink and farewell But when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the grass and chairs were set for her and for Celeborn Her maidens stood silent about her and a while she looked upon her guests At last she spoke again We have drunk the cup of parting she said and the shadows fall between us But before you go I have brought in my ship gifts which the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer you in memory of Lothlrien Then she called to each in turn Here is the gift of Celeborn and Galadriel to the leader of your Company she said to Aragorn and she gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his sword It was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves wrought of silver and gold and on it were set in elven runes formed of many gems the name Andril and the lineage of the sword The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even in defeat she said But is there aught else that you desire of me at our parting For darkness will flow between us and it may be that we shall not meet again unless it be far hence upon a road that has no returning And Aragorn answered Lady you know all my desire and long held in keeping the only treasure that I seek Yet it is not yours to give me even if you would and only through darkness shall I come to it Yet maybe this will lighten your heart said Galadriel for it was left in my care to be given to you should you pass through this land Then she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green set in a silver brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the leaves of spring This stone I gave to Celebran my daughter and she to hers and now it comes to you as a token of hope In this hour take the name that was foretold for you Elessar the Elfstone of the house of Elendil Then Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast and those who saw him wondered for they had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen from his shoulders For the gifts that you have given me I thank you he said O Lady of Lrien of whom were sprung Celebran and Arwen Evenstar What praise could I say more The Lady bowed her head and she turned then to Boromir and to him she gave a belt of gold and to Merry and Pippin she gave small silver belts each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower To Legolas she gave a bow such as the Galadhrim used longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood and strung with a string of elfhair With it went a quiver of arrows For you little gardener and lover of trees she said to Sam I have only a small gift She put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid Here is set G for Galadriel she said but also it may stand for garden in your tongue In this box there is earth from my orchard and such blessing as Galadriel has still to bestow is upon it It will not keep you on your road nor defend you against any peril but if you keep it and see your home again at last then perhaps it may reward you Though you should find all barren and laid waste there will be few gardens in Middleearth that will bloom like your garden if you sprinkle this earth there Then you may remember Galadriel and catch a glimpse far off of Lrien that you have seen only in our winter For our spring and our summer are gone by and they will never be seen on earth again save in memory Sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible as he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves said Galadriel turning to Gimli None Lady answered Gimli It is enough for me to have seen the Lady of the Galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words Hear all ye Elves she cried to those about her Let none say again that Dwarves are grasping and ungracious Yet surely Gimli son of Glin you desire something that I could give Name it I bid you You shall not be the only guest without a gift There is nothing Lady Galadriel said Gimli bowing low and stammering Nothing unless it might be unless it is permitted to ask nay to name a single strand of your hair which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of the mine I do not ask for such a gift But you commanded me to name my desire The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment and Celeborn gazed at the Dwarf in wonder but the Lady smiled It is said that the skill of the Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues she said yet that is not true of Gimli For none have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteous And how shall I refuse since I commanded him to speak But tell me what would you do with such a gift Treasure it Lady he answered in memory of your words to me at our first meeting And if ever I return to the smithies of my home it shall be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house and a pledge of good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days Then the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses and cut off three golden hairs and laid them in Gimlis hand These words shall go with the gift she said I do not foretell for all foretelling is now vain on the one hand lies darkness and on the other only hope But if hope should not fail then I say to you Gimli son of Glin that your hands shall flow with gold and yet over you gold shall have no dominion And you Ringbearer she said turning to Frodo I come to you last who are not last in my thoughts For you I have prepared this She held up a small crystal phial it glittered as she moved it and rays of white light sprang from her hand In this phial she said is caught the light of Erendils star set amid the waters of my fountain It will shine still brighter when night is about you May it be a light to you in dark places when all other lights go out Remember Galadriel and her Mirror Frodo took the phial and for a moment as it shone between them he saw her again standing like a queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible He bowed but found no words to say Now the Lady arose and Celeborn led them back to the hythe A yellow noon lay on the green land of the Tongue and the water glittered with silver All at last was made ready The Company took their places in the boats as before Crying farewell the Elves of Lrien with long grey poles thrust them out into the flowing stream and the rippling waters bore them slowly away The travellers sat still without moving or speaking On the green bank near to the very point of the Tongue the Lady Galadriel stood alone and silent As they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her slowly floating away from them For so it seemed to them Lrien was slipping backward like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees sailing on to forgotten shores while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey and leafless world Even as they gazed the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the Great River and their boats turned and began to speed southwards Soon the white form of the Lady was small and distant She shone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the westering sun or as a remote lake seen from a mountain a crystal fallen in the lap of the land Then it seemed to Frodo that she lifted her arms in a final farewell and far but piercingclear on the following wind came the sound of her voice singing But now she sang in the ancient tongue of the Elves beyond the Sea and he did not understand the words fair was the music but it did not comfort him Yet as is the way of Elvish words they remained graven in his memory and long afterwards he interpreted them as well as he could the language was that of Elvensong and spoke of things little known on Middleearth Ai lauri lantar lassi srinen Yni ntim ve rmar aldaron Yni ve lint yuldar avnier mi oromardi lissemiruvreva Andn pella Vardo tellumar nu luini

trees The long years have passed like swift draughts of the sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West beneath the blue vaults of Varda wherein the stars tremble in the song of her voice holy and queenly Who now shall refill the cup for me For now the Kindler Varda the Queen of the Stars from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds and all paths are drowned deep in shadow and out of a grey country darkness lies on the foaming waves between us and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya for ever Now lost lost to those from the East is Valimar Farewell Maybe thou shalt find Valimar Maybe even thou shalt find it Farewell Varda is the name of that Lady whom the Elves in these lands of exile name Elbereth Suddenly the River swept round a bend and the banks rose upon either side and the light of Lrien was hidden To that fair land Frodo never came again The travellers now turned their faces to the journey the sun was before them and their eyes were dazzled for all were filled with tears Gimli wept openly I have looked the last upon that which was fairest he said to Legolas his companion Henceforward I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift He put his hand to his breast Tell me Legolas why did I come on this Quest Little did I know where the chief peril lay Truly Elrond spoke saying that we could not foresee what we might meet upon our road Torment in the dark was the danger that I feared and it did not hold me back But I would not have come had I known the danger of light and joy Now I have taken my worst wound in this parting even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Lord Alas for Gimli son of Glin Nay said Legolas Alas for us all And for all that walk the world in these afterdays For such is the way of it to find and lose as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream But I count you blessed Gimli son of Glin for your loss you suffer of your own free will and you might have chosen otherwise But you have not forsaken your companions and the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of Lothlrien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your heart and shall neither fade nor grow stale Maybe said Gimli and I thank you for your words True words doubtless yet all such comfort is cold Memory is not what the heart desires That is only a mirror be it clear as Kheledzram Or so says the heart of Gimli the Dwarf Elves may see things otherwise Indeed I have heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream Not so for Dwarves But let us talk no more of it Look to the boat She is too low in the water with all this baggage and the Great River is swift I do not wish to drown my grief in cold water He took up a paddle and steered towards the western bank following Aragorns boat ahead which had already moved out of the middle stream So the Company went on their long way down the wide hurrying waters borne ever southwards Bare woods stalked along either bank and they could not see any glimpse of the lands behind The breeze died away and the River flowed without a sound No voice of bird broke the silence The sun grew misty as the day grew old until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl Then it faded into the West and dusk came early followed by a grey and starless night Far into the dark quiet hours they floated on guiding their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods Great trees passed by like ghosts thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the mist down into the water It was dreary and cold Frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle of the River fretting among the treeroots and driftwood near the shore until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep _Chapter 9_ The Great River Frodo was roused by Sam He found that he was lying well wrapped under tall greyskinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west bank of the Great River Anduin He had slept the night away and the grey of morning was dim among the bare branches Gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand They started again before the day was broad Not that most of the Company were eager to hurry southwards they were content that the decision which they must make at latest when they came to Rauros and the Tindrock Isle still lay some days ahead and they let the River bear them on at its own pace having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond whichever course they took in the end Aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished husbanding their strength against weariness to come But he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey on far into the evening for he felt in his heart that time was pressing and he feared that the Dark Lord had not been idle while they lingered in Lrien Nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day nor the next The dull grey hours passed without event As the third day of their voyage wore on the lands changed slowly the trees thinned and then failed altogether On the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching up and away toward the sky brown and withered they looked as if fire had passed over them leaving no living blade of green an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness They had come to the Brown Lands that lay vast and desolate between Southern Mirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil What pestilence or war or evil deed of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell Upon the west to their right the land was treeless also but it was flat and in many places green with wide plains of grass On this side of the River they passed forests of great reeds so tall that they shut out all view to the west as the little boats went rustling by along their fluttering borders Their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light cold airs hissing softly and sadly Here and there through openings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads and far beyond them hills in the sunset and away on the edge of sight a dark line where marched the southernmost ranks of the Misty Mountains There was no sign of living moving things save birds Of these there were many small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds but they were seldom seen Once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of swanwings and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky Swans said Sam And mighty big ones too Yes said Aragorn and they are black swans How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks said Frodo I always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier until winter was left behind for ever But we have not journeyed far south yet answered Aragorn It is still winter and we are far from the sea Here the world is cold until the sudden spring and we may yet have snow again Far away down in the Bay of Belfalas to which Anduin runs it is warm and merry maybe or would be but for the Enemy But here we are not above sixty leagues I guess south of the Southfarthing away in your Shire hundreds of long miles yonder You are looking now southwest across the north plains of the Riddermark Rohan the land of the Horselords Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight that runs down from Fangorn to join the Great River That is the north boundary of Rohan and of old all that lay between Limlight and the White Mountains belonged to the Rohirrim It is a rich and pleasant land and its grass has no rival but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the River or ride often to its shores Anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot their arrows far across the stream and of late it is said they have dared to cross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily The trees had seemed hostile before as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that the trees were still there He felt that the Company was too naked afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands and on a river that was the frontier of war In the next day or two as they went on borne steadily southwards this feeling of insecurity grew on all the Company For a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forward The banks slid by Soon the River broadened and grew more shallow long stony beaches lay upon the east and there were gravelshoals in the water so that careful steering was needed The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds over which flowed a chill air from the East On the other side the meads had become rolling downs of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock Frodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlrien There was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats Each member of the Company was busy with his own thoughts The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glade amid the beechwoods Gimli was fingering gold in his mind and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the Ladys gift Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease for Boromir sat muttering to himself sometimes biting his nails as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorns Then Pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught a queer gleam in his eye as he peered forward gazing at Frodo Sam had long ago made up his mind that though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined He was cramped and miserable having nothing to do but stare at the winterlands crawling by and the grey water on either side of him Even when the paddles were in use they did not trust Sam with one As dusk drew down on the fourth day he was looking back over the bowed heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats he was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under his toes Suddenly something caught his sight at first he stared at it listlessly then he sat up and rubbed his eyes but when he looked again he could not see it any more That night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank Sam lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo I had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped Mr Frodo he said Or maybe it wasnt a dream Funny it was anyway Well what was it said Frodo knowing that Sam would not settle down until he had told his tale whatever it was I havent seen or thought of anything to make me smile since we left Lothlrien It wasnt funny that way Mr Frodo It was queer All wrong if it wasnt a dream And you had best hear it It was like this I saw a log with eyes The logs all right said Frodo There are many in the River But leave out the eyes That I wont said Sam Twas the eyes as made me sit up so to speak I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the halflight behind Gimlis boat but I didnt give much heed to it Then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up And that was peculiar as you might say seeing as we were all floating on the stream together Just then I saw the eyes two pale sort of points shinylike on a hump at the near end of the log Whats more it wasnt a log for it had paddlefeet like a swans almost only they seemed bigger and kept dipping in and out of the water Thats when I sat right up and rubbed my eyes meaning to give a shout if it was still there when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head For the whateveritwas was coming along fast now and getting close behind Gimli But whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring or whether I came to my senses I dont know When I looked again it wasnt there Yet I think I caught a glimpse with the tail ofmy eye as the saying is of something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank I couldnt see no more eyes though I said to myself dreaming again Sam Gamgee I said and I said no more just then But Ive been thinking since and now Im not so sure What do you make of it Mr Frodo I should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your eyes Sam said Frodo if this was the first time that those eyes had been seen But it isnt I saw them away back north before we reached Lrien And I saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night Haldir saw it too And do you remember the report of the Elves that went after the orcband Ah said Sam I do and I remember more too I dont like my thoughts but thinking of one thing and another and Mr Bilbos stories and all I fancy I could put a name on the creature at a guess A nasty name Gollum maybe Yes that is what I have feared for some time said Frodo Ever since the night on the flet I suppose he was lurking in Moria and picked up our trail then but I hoped that our stay in Lrien would throw him off the scent again The miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods by the Silverlode watching us start off Thats about it said Sam And wed better be a bit more watchful ourselves or well feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these nights if we ever wake up to feel anything And thats what I was leading up to No need to trouble Strider or the others tonight Ill keep watch I can sleep tomorrow being no more than luggage in a boat as you might say I might said Frodo and I might say luggage with eyes You shall watch but only if you promise to wake me halfway towards morning if nothing happens before then In the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find Sam shaking him Its a shame to wake you whispered Sam but thats what you said Theres nothing to tell or not much I thought I heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise a while back but you hear a lot of such queer sounds by a river at night He lay down and Frodo sat up huddled in his blankets and fought off his sleep Minutes or hours passed slowly and nothing happened Frodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape hardly visible floated close to one of the moored boats A long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly as they peered inside and then they lifted and gazed up at Frodo on the eyot They were not more than a yard or two away and Frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath He stood up drawing Sting from its sheath and faced the eyes Immediately their light was shut off There was another hiss and a splash and the dark logshape shot away downstream into the night Aragorn stirred in his sleep turned over and sat up What is it he whispered springing up and coming to Frodo I felt something in my sleep Why have you drawn your sword Gollum answered Frodo Or at least so I guess Ah said Aragorn So you know about our little footpad do you He padded after us all through Moria and right down to Nimrodel Since we took to boats he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet I have tried to catch him once or twice at night but he is slier than a fox and as slippery as a fish I hoped the rivervoyage would beat him but he is too clever a waterman We shall have to try going faster tomorrow You lie down now and I will keep watch for what is left of the night I wish I could lay my hands on the wretch We might make him useful But if I cannot we shall have to try and lose him He is very dangerous Quite apart from murder by night on his own account he may put any enemy that is about on our track The night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again After that the Company kept a sharp lookout but they saw no more of Gollum while the voyage lasted If he was still following he was very wary and cunning At Aragorns bidding they paddled now for long spells and the banks went swiftly by But they saw little of the country for they journeyed mostly by night and twilight resting by day and lying as hidden as the land allowed In this way the time passed without event until the seventh day The weather was still grey and overcast with wind from the East but as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared and pools of faint light yellow and pale green opened under the grey shores of cloud There the white rind of the new Moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes Sam looked at it and puckered his brows The next day the country on either side began to change rapidly The banks began to rise and grow stony Soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and sloe tangled with brambles and creepers Behind them stood low crumbling cliffs and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy and beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with windwrithen firs They were drawing near to the grey hillcountry of the Emyn Muil the southern march of Wilderland There were many birds about the cliffs and the rockchimneys and all day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling black against the pale sky As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn watched the flights doubtfully wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the wilderness Later as the sun was setting and the Company was stirring and getting ready to start again he descried a dark spot against the fading light a great bird high and far off now wheeling now flying on slowly southwards What is that Legolas he asked pointing to the northern sky Is it as I think an eagle Yes said Legolas It is an eagle a hunting eagle I wonder what that forebodes It is far from the mountains We will not start until it is fully dark said Aragorn The eighth night of their journey came It was silent and windless the grey east wind had passed away The thin crescent of the Moon had fallen early into the pale sunset but the sky was clear above and though far away in the South there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly in the West stars glinted bright Come said Aragorn We will venture one more journey by night We are coming to reaches of the River that I do not know well for I have never journeyed by water in these parts before not between here and the rapids of Sarn Gebir But if I am right in my reckoning those are still many miles ahead Still there are dangerous places even before we come there rocks and stony eyots in the stream We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly To Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman He lay forward peering into the gloom The night grew dark but the stars above were strangely bright and there was a glimmer On the face of the River It was close on midnight and they had been drifting for some while hardly using the paddles when suddenly Sam cried out Only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water There was a swift current which swung left towards the eastern shore where the channel was clear As they were swept aside the travellers could see now very close the pale foam of the River lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth The boats were all huddled together Hoy there Aragorn shouted Boromir as his boat bumped into the leader This is madness We cannot dare the Rapids by night But no boat can live in Sarn Gebir be it night or day Back back cried Aragorn Turn Turn if you can He drove his paddle into the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round I am out of my reckoning he said to Frodo I did not know that we had come so far Anduin flows faster than I thought Sarn Gebir must be close at hand already With great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them about but at first they could make only small headway against the current and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank Now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night All together paddle shouted Boromir Paddle Or we shall be driven on the shoals Even as he spoke Frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone At that moment there was a twang of bowstrings several arrows whistled over them and some fell among them One smote Frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward with a cry letting go his paddle but the arrow fell back foiled by his hidden coat of mail Another passed through Aragorns hood and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat close by Merrys hand Sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long shinglebanks that lay under the eastern shore They seemed very near _Yrch_ said Legolas falling into his own tongue Orcs cried Gimli Gollums doing Ill be bound said Sam to Frodo And a nice place to choose too The River seems set on taking us right into their arms They all leaned forward straining at the paddles even Sam took a hand Every moment they expected to feel the bite of blackfeathered arrows Many whined overhead or struck the water nearby but there were no more hits It was dark but not too dark for the nighteyes of Orcs and in the starglimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark unless it was that the grey cloaks Of Lrien and the grey timber of the elfwrought boats defeated the malice of the archers of Mordor Stroke by stroke they laboured on In the darkness it was hard to be sure that they were indeed moving at all but slowly the swirl of the water grew less and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night At last as far as they could judge they had reached the middle of the stream again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks Then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the western shore Under the shadow Of bushes leaning out over the water they halted and drew breath Legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from Lrien Then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank Stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned peering back over the River into the darkness Across the water there were shrill cries but nothing could be seen Frodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him as he gazed into the night seeking a mark to shoot at His head was dark crowned with sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind But now rising and sailing up from the South the great clouds advanced sending out dark outriders into the starry fields A sudden dread fell on the Company _Elbereth Gilthoniel_ sighed Legolas as he looked up Even as he did so a dark shape like a cloud and yet not a cloud for it moved far more swiftly came out of the blackness in the South and sped towards the Company blotting out all light as it approached Soon it appeared as a great winged creature blacker than the pits in the night Fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water Frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at his heart there was a deadly cold like the memory of an old wound in his shoulder He crouched down as if to hide Suddenly the great bow of Lrien sang Shrill went the arrow from the elvenstring Frodo looked up Almost above him the winged shape swerved There was a harsh croaking scream as it fell out of the air vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore The sky was clean again There was a tumult of many voices far away cursing and wailing in the darkness and then silence Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night After a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream They felt their way along the waters edge for some distance until they found a small shallow bay A few low trees grew there close to the water and behind them rose a steep rocky bank Here the Company decided to stay and await the dawn it was useless to attempt to move further by night They made no camp and lit no fire but lay huddled in the boats moored close together Praised be the bow of Galadriel and the hand and eye of Legolas said Gimli as he munched a wafer of _lembas_ That was a mighty shot in the dark my friend But who can say what it hit said Legolas I cannot said Gimli But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer I liked it not at all Too much it reminded me of the shadow in Moria the shadow of the Balrog he ended in a whisper It was not a Balrog said Frodo still shivering with the chill that had come upon him It was something colder I think it was Then he paused and fell silent What do you think asked Boromir eagerly leaning from his boat as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodos face I think No I will not say answered Frodo Whatever it was its fall has dismayed our enemies So it seems said Aragorn Yet where they are and how many and what they will do next we do not know This night we must all be sleepless Dark hides us now But what the day will show who can tell Have your weapons close to hand Sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his fingers and looking up at the sky Its very strange he murmured The Moons the same in the Shire and in Wilderland or it ought to be But either its out of its running or Im all wrong in my reckoning Youll remember Mr Frodo the Moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that tree a week from the full I reckon And wed been a week on the way last night when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nailparing as if we had never stayed no time in the Elvish country Well I can remember three nights there for certain and I seem to remember several more but I would take my oath it was never a whole month Anyone would think that time did not count in there And perhaps that was the way of it said Frodo In that land maybe we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by It was not I think until Silverlode bore us back to Anduin that we returned to the time that flows through mortal lands to the Great Sea And I dont remember any moon either new or old in Caras Galadhon only stars by night and sun by day Legolas stirred in his boat Nay time does not tarry ever he said but change and growth is not in all things and places alike For the Elves the world moves and it moves both very swift and very slow Swift because they themselves change little and all else fleets by it is a grief to them Slow because they do not count the running years not for themselves The passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream Yet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end at last But the wearing is slow in Lrien said Frodo The power of the Lady is on it Rich are the hours though short they seem in Caras Galadhon where Galadriel wields the Elvenring That should not have been said outside Lrien not even to me said Aragorn Speak no more of it But so it is Sam in that land you lost your count There time flowed swiftly by us as for the Elves The old moon passed and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside while we tarried there And yestereve a new moon came again Winter is nearly gone Time flows on to a spring of little hope The night passed silently No voice or call was heard again across the water The travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the weather The air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that had floated up from the South and the distant seas The rushing of the River over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer The twigs of the trees above them began to drip When the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sad Slowly the dawn grew to a pale light diffused and shadowless There was mist on the River and white fog swathed the shore the far bank could not be seen I cant abide fog said Sam but this seems to be a lucky one Now perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us Perhaps so said Aragorn But it will be hard to find the path unless the fog lifts a little later on And we must find the path if we are to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the River any further said Boromir If the Emyn Muil lie before us then we can abandon these cockleboats and strike westward and southward until we come to the Entwash and cross into my own land We can if we are making for Minas Tirith said Aragorn but that is not yet agreed And such a course may be more perilous than it sounds The vale of Entwash is flat and fenny and fog is a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden I would not abandon our boats until we must The River is at least a path that cannot be missed But the Enemy holds the eastern bank objected Boromir And even if you pass the Gates of Argonath and come unmolested to the Tindrock what will you do then Leap down the Falls and land in the marshes No answered Aragorn Say rather that we will bear our boats by the ancient way to Raurosfoot and there take to the water again Do you not know Boromir or do you choose to forget the North Stair and the high seat upon Amon Hen that were made in the days of the great kings I at least have a mind to stand in that high place again before I decide my further course There maybe we shall see some sign that will guide us Boromir held out long against this choice but when it became plain that Frodo would follow Aragorn wherever he went he gave in It is not the way of the Men of Minas Tirith to desert their friends at need he said and you will need my strength if ever you are to reach the Tindrock To the tall isle I will go but no further There I shall turn to my home alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship The day was now growing and the fog had lifted a little It was decided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward along the shore while the others remained by the boats Aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the Rapids Boats of the Elves would not sink maybe he said but that does not say that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive None have ever done so yet No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this region for even in their great days their realm did not reach up Anduin beyond the Emyn Muil but there is a portageway somewhere on the western shore if I can find it It cannot yet have perished for light boats used to journey out of Wilderland down to Osgiliath and still did so until a few years ago when the Orcs of Mordor began to multiply Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the North and the Orcs prowl on the eastshore said Boromir If you go forward peril will grow with every mile even if you find a path Peril lies ahead on every southward road answered Aragorn Wait for us one day If we do not return in that time you will know that evil has indeed befallen us Then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you can It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the steep bank and vanish into the mists but his fears proved groundless Only two or three hours had passed and it was barely midday when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared again All is well said Aragorn as he clambered down the bank There is a track and it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable The distance is not great the head of the Rapids is but half a mile below us and they are little more than a mile long Not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth again though it runs swiftly Our hardest task will be to get our boats and baggage to the old portageway We have found it but it lies well back from the waterside here and runs under the lee of a rockwall a furlong or more from the shore We did not find where the northward landing lies If it still remains we must have passed it yesterday night We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog I fear we must leave the River now and make for the portageway as best we can from here That would not be easy even if we were all Men said Boromir Yet such as we are we will try it said Aragorn Aye we will said Gimli The legs of Men will lag on a rough road while a Dwarf goes on be the burden twice his own weight Master Boromir The task proved hard indeed yet in the end it was done The goods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank where there was a level space Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up They were far less heavy than any had expected Of what tree growing in the elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew but the wood was tough and yet strangely light Merry and Pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat Nonetheless it needed the strength of the two Men to lift and haul them over the ground that the Company now had to cross It sloped up away from the River a tumbled waste of grey limestoneboulders with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes there were thickets of brambles and sheer dells and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the terraces further inland One by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats while the others toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage At last all was removed and laid on the portageway Then with little further hindrance save from sprawling briars and many fallen stones they moved forward all together Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rockwall and to their left mist shrouded the River they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir but they could not see it Twice they made the journey before all was brought safe to the southern landing There the portageway turning back to the waterside ran gently down to the shallow edge of a little pool It seemed to have been scooped in the riverside not by hand but by the water swirling down from Sarn Gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the stream Beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff and there was no further passage for those on foot Already the short afternoon was past and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in They sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the Rapids hidden in the mist they were tired and sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day Well here we are and here we must pass another night said Boromir We need sleep and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the Gates of Argonath by night we are all too tiredexcept no doubt our sturdy dwarf Gimli made no reply he was nodding as he sat Let us rest as much as we can now said Aragorn Tomorrow we must journey by day again Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us we shall have a good chance of slipping through unseen by any eyes on the eastern shore But tonight two must watch together in turns three hours off and one on guard Nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour before dawn As soon as it was fully light they started Already the fog was thinning They kept as close as they could to the western side and they could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying river In the midmorning the clouds drew down lower and it began to rain heavily They drew the skincovers over their boats to prevent them from being flooded and drifted on little could be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains The rain however did not last long Slowly the sky above grew lighter and then suddenly the clouds broke and their draggled fringes trailed away northward up the River The fogs and mists were gone Before the travellers lay a wide ravine with great rocky sides to which clung upon shelves and in narrow crevices a few thrawn trees The channel grew narrower and the River swifter Now they were speeding along with little hope of stopping or turning whatever they might meet ahead Over them was a lane of paleblue sky around them the dark overshadowed River and before them black shutting out the sun the hills of Emyn Muil in which no opening could be seen Frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed Tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream A narrow gap appeared between them and the River swept the boats towards it Behold the Argonath the Pillars of the Kings cried Aragorn We shall pass them soon Keep the boats in line and as far apart as you can Hold the middle of the stream As Frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet him Giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but threatening Then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned the craft and power of old had wrought upon them and still they preserved through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn Upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone still with blurred eyes and crannied brows they frowned upon the North The left hand of each was raised palm outwards in gesture of warning in each right hand there was an axe upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown Great power and majesty they still wore the silent wardens of a longvanished kingdom Awe and fear fell upon Frodo and he cowered down shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drew near Even Boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by frail and fleeting as little leaves under the enduring shadow of the sentinels of Nmenor So they passed into the dark chasm of the Gates Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side Far off was the dim sky The black waters roared and echoed and a wind screamed over them Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front muttering and groaning What a place What a horrible place Just let me get out of this boat and Ill never wet my toes in a puddle again let alone a river Fear not said a strange voice behind him Frodo turned and saw Strider and yet not Strider for the weatherworn Ranger was no longer there In the stern sat Aragorn son of Arathorn proud and erect guiding the boat with skilful strokes his hood was cast back and his dark hair was blowing in the wind a light was in his eyes a king returning from exile to his own land Fear not he said Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of Isildur and Anrion my sires of old Under their shadow Elessar the Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil Isildurs son heir of Elendil has nought to dread Then the light of his eyes faded and he spoke to himself Would that Gandalf were here How my heart yearns for Minas Anor and the walls of my own city But whither now shall I go The chasm was long and dark and filled with the noise of wind and rushing water and echoing stone It bent somewhat towards the west so that at first all was dark ahead but soon Frodo saw a tall gap of light before him ever growing Swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boats shot through out into a wide clear light The sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a windy sky The pent waters spread out into a long oval lake pale Nen Hithoel fenced by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees but their heads were bare coldgleaming in the sunlight At the far southern end rose three peaks The midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered from them an island in the waters about which the flowing River flung pale shimmering arms Distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound like the roll of thunder heard far away Behold Tol Brandir said Aragorn pointing south to the tall peak Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw and upon the right is Amon Hen the Hills of Hearing and of Sight In the days of the great kings there were high seats upon them and watch was kept there But it is said that no foot of man or beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir Ere the shade of night falls we shall come to them I hear the endless voice of Rauros calling The Company rested now for a while drifting south on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake They ate some food and then they took to their paddles and hastened on their way The sides of the westward hills fell into shadow and the Sun grew round and red Here and there a misty star peered out The three peaks loomed before them darkling in the twilight Rauros was roaring with a great voice Already night was laid on the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the hills The tenth day of their journey was over Wilderland was behind them They could go no further without choice between the eastway and the west The last stage of the Quest was before them _Chapter 10_ The Breaking of the Fellowship Aragorn led them to the right arm of the River Here upon its western side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of Amon Hen Behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill clad with trees and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of the lake A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass Here we will rest tonight said Aragorn This is the lawn of Parth Galen a fair place in the summer days of old Let us hope that no evil has yet come here They drew up their boats on the green banks and beside them they made their camp They set a watch but had no sight nor sound of their enemies If Gollum had contrived to follow them he remained unseen and unheard Nonetheless as the night wore on Aragorn grew uneasy tossing often in his sleep and waking In the small hours he got up and came to Frodo whose turn it was to watch Why are you waking asked Frodo It is not your watch I do not know answered Aragorn but a shadow and a threat has been growing in my sleep It would be well to draw your sword Why said Frodo Are enemies at hand Let us see what Sting may show answered Aragorn Frodo then drew the elfblade from its sheath To his dismay the edges gleamed dimly in the night Orcs he said Not very near and yet too near it seems I feared as much said Aragorn But maybe they are not on this side of the River The light of Sting is faint and it may point to no more than spies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Amon Lhaw I have never heard before of Orcs upon Amon Hen Yet who knows what may happen in these evil days now that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages of Anduin We must go warily tomorrow The day came like fire and smoke Low in the East there were black bars of cloud like the fumes of a great burning The rising sun lit them from beneath with flames of murky red but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with gold Frodo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island Its sides sprang sheer out of the running water High up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed mounting one head above another and above them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock crowned by a great spire of stone Many birds were circling about it but no sign of other living things could be seen When they had eaten Aragorn called the Company together The day has come at last he said the day of choice which we have long delayed What shall now become of our Company that has travelled so far in fellowship Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor or turn east to the Fear and Shadow or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and that as each may choose Whatever we do must be done soon We cannot long halt here The enemy is on the eastern shore we know but I fear that the Orcs may already be on this side of the water There was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved Well Frodo said Aragorn at last I fear that the burden is laid upon you You are the Bearer appointed by the Council Your own way you alone can choose In this matter I cannot advise you I am not Gandalf and though I have tried to bear his part I do not know what design or hope he had for this hour if indeed he had any Most likely it seems that if he were here now the choice would still wait on you Such is your fate Frodo did not answer at once Then he spoke slowly I know that haste is needed yet I cannot choose The burden is heavy Give me an hour longer and I will speak Let me be alone Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity Very well Frodo son of Drogo he said You shall have an hour and you shall be alone We will stay here for a while But do not stray far or out of call Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed Sam who had been watching his master with great concern shook his head and muttered Plain as a pikestaff it is but its no good Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now Presently Frodo got up and walked away and Sam saw that while the others restrained themselves and did not stare at him the eyes of Boromir followed Frodo intently until he passed out of sight in the trees at the foot of Amon Hen Wandering aimlessly at first in the wood Frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill He came to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago In steep places stairs of stone had been hewn but now they were cracked and worn and split by the roots of trees For some while he climbed not caring which way he went until he came to a grassy place Rowantrees grew about it and in the midst was a wide flat stone The little upland lawn was open upon the East and was filled now with the early sunlight Frodo halted and looked out over the River far below him to Tol Brandir and the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle The voice of Rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom He sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes All that had happened since Bilbo left the Shire was passing through his mind and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of Gandalfs words Time went on and still he was no nearer to a choice Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts a strange feeling came to him that something was behind him that unfriendly eyes were upon him He sprang up and turned but all that he saw to his surprise was Boromir and his face was smiling and kind I was afraid for you Frodo he said coming forward If Aragorn is right and Orcs are near then none of us should wander alone and you least of all so much depends on you And my heart too is heavy May I stay now and talk for a while since I have found you It would comfort me Where there are so many all speech becomes a debate without end But two together may perhaps find wisdom You are kind answered Frodo But I do not think that any speech will help me For I know what I should do but I am afraid of doing it Boromir afraid Boromir stood silent Rauros roared endlessly on The wind murmured in the branches of the trees Frodo shivered Suddenly Boromir came and sat beside him Are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly he said I wish to help you You need counsel in your hard choice Will you not take mine I think I know already what counsel you would give Boromir said Frodo And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart Warning Warning against what said Boromir sharply Against delay Against the way that seems easier Against refusal of the burden that is laid on me Againstwell if it must be said against trust in the strength and truth of Men Yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little country though you knew it not I do not doubt the valour of your people But the world is changing The walls of Minas Tirith may be strong but they are not strong enough If they fail what then We shall fall in battle valiantly Yet there is still hope that they will not fail No hope while the Ring lasts said Frodo Ah The Ring said Boromir his eyes lighting The Ring Is it not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing So small a thing And I have seen it only for an instant in the House of Elrond Could I not have a sight of it again Frodo looked up His heart went suddenly cold He caught the strange gleam in Boromirs eyes yet his face was still kind and friendly It is best that it should lie hidden he answered As you wish I care not said Boromir Yet may I not even speak of it For you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the Enemy of its evil uses not of its good The world is changing you say Minas Tirith will fall if the Ring lasts But why Certainly if the Ring were with the Enemy But why if it were with us Were you not at the Council answered Frodo Because we cannot use it and what is done with it turns to evil Boromir got up and walked about impatiently So you go on he cried Gandalf Elrond all these folk have taught you to say so For themselves they may be right These elves and halfelves and wizards they would come to grief perhaps Yet often I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid But each to his own kind Truehearted Men they will not be corrupted We of Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years of trial We do not desire the power of wizardlords only strength to defend ourselves strength in a just cause And behold in our need chance brings to light the Ring of Power It is a gift I say a gift to the foes of Mordor It is mad not to use it to use the power of the Enemy against him The fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve victory What could not a warrior do in this hour a great leader What could not Aragorn do Or if he refuses why not Boromir The Ring would give me power of Command How I would drive the hosts of Mordor and all men would flock to my banner Boromir strode up and down speaking ever more loudly Almost he seemed to have forgotten Frodo while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons and the mustering of men and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious victories to be and he cast down Mordor and became himself a mighty king benevolent and wise Suddenly he stopped and waved his arms And they tell us to throw it away he cried I do not say _destroy_ it That might be well if reason could show any hope of doing so It does not The only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance of recapturing it for himself Folly Surely you see it my friend he said turning now suddenly to Frodo again You say that you are afraid If it is so the boldest should pardon you But is it not really your good sense that revolts No I am afraid said Frodo Simply afraid But I am glad to have heard you speak so fully My mind is clearer now Then you will come to Minas Tirith cried Boromir His eyes were shining and his face eager You misunderstand me said Frodo But you will come at least for a while Boromir persisted My city is not far now and it is little further from there to Mordor than from here We have been long in the wilderness and you need news of what the Enemy is doing before you make a move Come with me Frodo he said You need rest before your venture if go you must He laid his hand on the hobbits shoulder in friendly fashion but Frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement He stepped quickly away and eyed with alarm the tall Man nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength Why are you so unfriendly said Boromir I am a true man neither thief nor tracker I need your Ring that you know now but I give you my word that I do not desire to keep it Will you not at least let me make trial of my plan Lend me the Ring No no cried Frodo The Council laid it upon me to bear it It is by our own folly that the Enemy will defeat us cried Boromir How it angers me Fool Obstinate fool Running wilfully to death and ruining our cause If any mortals have claim to the Ring it is the men of Nmenor and not Halflings It is not yours save by unhappy chance It might have been mine It should be mine Give it to me Frodo did not answer but moved away till the great flat stone stood between them Come come my friend said Boromir in a softer voice Why not get rid of it Why not be free of your doubt and fear You can lay the blame on me if you will You can say that I was too strong and took it by force For I am too strong for you halfling he cried and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at Frodo His fair and pleasant face was hideously changed a raging fire was in his eyes Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them There was only one thing he could do trembling he pulled out the Ring upon its chain and quickly slipped it on his finger even as Boromir sprang at him again The Man gasped stared for a moment amazed and then ran wildly about seeking here and there among the rocks and trees Miserable trickster he shouted Let me get my hands on you Now I see your mind You will take the Ring to Sauron and sell us all You have only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch Curse you and all halflings to death and darkness Then catching his foot on a stone he fell sprawling and lay upon his face For a while he was as still as if his own curse had struck him down then suddenly he wept He rose and passed his hand over his eyes dashing away the tears What have I said he cried What have I done Frodo Frodo he called Come back A madness took me but it has passed Come back There was no answer Frodo did not even hear his cries He was already far away leaping blindly up the path to the hilltop Terror and grief shook him seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of Boromir and his burning eyes Soon he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen and halted gasping for breath He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle paved with mighty flags and surrounded with a crumbling battlement and in the middle set upon four carven pillars was a high seat reached by a stair of many steps Up he went and sat upon the ancient chair feeling like a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountainkings At first he could see little He seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only shadows the Ring was upon him Then here and there the mist gave way and he saw many visions small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table and yet remote There was no sound only bright living images The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent He was sitting upon the Seat of Seeing on Amon Hen the Hill of the Eye of the Men of Nmenor Eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands nameless plains and forests unexplored Northward he looked and the Great River lay like a ribbon beneath him and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan and Orthanc the pinnacle of Isengard like a black spike Southward he looked and below his very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume And Ethir Anduin he saw the mighty delta of the River and myriads of seabirds whirling like a white dust in the sun and beneath them a green and silver sea rippling in endless lines But everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war The Misty Mountains were crawling like anthills orcs were issuing out of a thousand holes Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife of Elves and Men and fell beasts The land of the Beornings was aflame a cloud was over Moria smoke rose on the borders of Lrien Horsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan wolves poured from Isengard From the havens of Harad ships of war put out to sea and out of the East Men were moving endlessly swordsmen spearmen bowmen upon horses chariots of chieftains and laden wains All the power of the Dark Lord was in motion Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith Far away it seemed and beautiful whitewalled manytowered proud and fair upon its mountainseat its battlements glittered with steel and its turrets were bright with many banners Hope leaped in his heart But against Minas Tirith was set another fortress greater and more strong Thither eastward unwilling his eye was drawn It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath the grinning gates of Minas Morgul and the haunted Mountains and it looked upon Gorgoroth the valley of terror in the Land of Mordor Darkness lay there under the Sun Fire glowed amid the smoke Mount Doom was burning and a great reek rising Then at last his gaze was held wall upon wall battlement upon battlement black immeasurably strong mountain of iron gate of steel tower of adamant he saw it Baraddr Fortress of Sauron All hope left him And suddenly he felt the Eye There was an eye in the Dark Tower that did not sleep He knew that it had become aware of his gaze A fierce eager will was there It leaped towards him almost like a finger he felt it searching for him Very soon it would nail him down know just exactly where he was Amon Lhaw it touched It glanced upon Tol Brandir he threw himself from the seat crouching covering his head with his grey hood He heard himself crying out _Never never_Or was it _Verily I come I come to you_ He could not tell Then as a flash from some other point of power there came to his mind another thought _Take it off Take it off Fool take it off Take off the Ring_ The two powers strove in him For a moment perfectly balanced between their piercing points he writhed tormented Suddenly he was aware of himself again Frodo neither the Voice nor the Eye free to choose and with one remaining instant in which to do so He took the Ring off his finger He was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat A black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him it missed Amon Hen and groped out west and faded Then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree Frodo rose to his feet A great weariness was on him but his will was firm and his heart lighter He spoke aloud to himself I will do now what I must he said This at least is plain the evil of the Ring is already at work even in the Company and the Ring must leave them before it does more harm I will go alone Some I cannot trust and those I can trust are too dear to me poor old Sam and Merry and Pippin Strider too his heart yearns for Minas Tirith and he will be needed there now Boromir has fallen into evil I will go alone At once He went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where Boromir had found him Then he halted listening He thought he could hear cries and calls from the woods near the shore below Theyll be hunting for me he said I wonder how long I have been away Hours I should think He hesitated What can I do he muttered I must go now or I shall never go I shant get a chance again I hate leaving them and like this without any explanation But surely they will understand Sam will And what else can I do Slowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more He vanished and passed down the hill less than a rustle of the wind The others remained long by the riverside For some time they had been silent moving restlessly about but now they were sitting in a circle and they were talking Every now and again they made efforts to speak of other things of their long road and many adventures they questioned Aragorn concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history and the remnants of its great works that could still be seen in this strange borderland of the Emyn Muil the stone kings and the seats of Lhaw and Hen and the great Stair beside the falls of Rauros But always their thoughts and words strayed back to Frodo and the Ring What would Frodo choose to do Why was he hesitating He is debating which course is the most desperate I think said Aragorn And well he may It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company to go east since we have been tracked by Gollum and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed But Minas Tirith is no nearer to the Fire and the destruction of the Burden We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand but the Lord Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even Elrond said was beyond his power either to keep the Burden secret or to hold off the full might of the Enemy when he comes to take it Which way would any of us choose in Frodos place I do not know Now indeed we miss Gandalf most Grievous is our loss said Legolas Yet we must needs make up our minds without his aid Why cannot we decide and so help Frodo Let us call him back and then vote I should vote for Minas Tirith And so should I said Gimli We of course were only sent to help the Bearer along the road to go no further than we wished and none of us is under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom Hard was my parting from Lothlrien Yet I have come so far and I say this now we have reached the last choice it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo I would choose Minas Tirith but if he does not then I follow him And I too will go with him said Legolas It would be faithless now to say farewell It would indeed be a betrayal if we all left him said Aragorn But if he goes east then all need not go with him nor do I think that all should That venture is desperate as much so for eight as for three or two or one alone If you would let me choose then I should appoint three companions Sam who could not bear it otherwise and Gimli and myself Boromir will return to his own city where his father and his people need him and with him the others should go or at least Meriadoc and Peregrin if Legolas is not willing to leave us That wont do at all cried Merry We cant leave Frodo Pippin and I always intended to go wherever he went and we still do But we did not realize what that would mean It seemed different so far away in the Shire or in Rivendell It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor Why cant we stop him We must stop him said Pippin And that is what he is worrying about I am sure He knows we shant agree to his going east And he doesnt like to ask anyone to go with him poor old fellow Imagine it going off to Mordor alone Pippin shuddered But the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know that he hasnt got to ask He ought to know that if we cant stop him we shant leave him Begging your pardon said Sam I dont think you understand my master at all He isnt hesitating about which way to go Of course not Whats the good of Minas Tirith anyway To him I mean begging your pardon Master Boromir he added and turned It was then that they discovered that Boromir who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle was no longer there Now wheres he got to cried Sam looking worried Hes been a bit queer lately to my mind But anyway hes not in this business Hes off to his home as he always said and no blame to him But Mr Frodo he knows hes got to find the Cracks of Doom if he can But hes _afraid_ Now its come to the point hes just plain terrified Thats what his trouble is Of course hes had a bit of schooling so to speakwe all havesince we left home or hed be so terrified hed just fling the Ring in the River and bolt But hes still too frightened to start And he isnt worrying about us either whether well go along with him or no He knows we mean to Thats another thing thats bothering him If he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone Mark my words Were going to have trouble when he comes back For hell screw himself up all right as sure as his names Baggins I believe you speak more wisely than any of us Sam said Aragorn And what shall we do if you prove right Stop him Dont let him go cried Pippin I wonder said Aragorn He is the Bearer and the fate of the Burden is on him I do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or the other Nor do I think that we should succeed if we tried There are other powers at work far stronger Well I wish Frodo would screw himself up and come back and let us get it over said Pippin This waiting is horrible Surely the time is up Yes said Aragorn The hour is long passed The morning is wearing away We must call for him At that moment Boromir reappeared He came out from the trees and walked towards them without speaking His face looked grim and sad He paused as if counting those that were present and then sat down aloof with his eyes on the ground Where have you been Boromir asked Aragorn Have you seen Frodo Boromir hesitated for a second Yes and no he answered slowly Yes I found him some way up the hill and I spoke to him I urged him to come to Minas Tirith and not to go east I grew angry and he left me He vanished I have never seen such a thing happen before though I have heard of it in tales He must have put the Ring on I could not find him again I thought he would return to you Is that all that you have to say said Aragorn looking hard and not too kindly at Boromir Yes he answered I will say no more yet This is bad cried Sam jumping up I dont know what this Man has been up to Why should Mr Frodo put the thing on He didnt ought to have and if he has goodness knows what may have happened But he wouldnt keep it on said Merry Not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor like Bilbo used to But where did he go Where is he cried Pippin Hes been away ages now How long is it since you saw Frodo last Boromir asked Aragorn Half an hour maybe he answered Or it might be an hour I have wandered for some time since I do not know I do not know He put his head in his hands and sat as if bowed with grief An hour since he vanished shouted Sam We must try and find him at once Come on Wait a moment cried Aragorn We must divide up into pairs and arrangehere hold on Wait It was no good They took no notice of him Sam had dashed off first Merry and Pippin had followed and were already disappearing westward into the trees by the shore shouting _Frodo Frodo_ in their clear high hobbitvoices Legolas and Gimli were running A sudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on the Company We shall all be scattered and lost groaned Aragorn Boromir I do not know what part you have played in this mischief but help now Go after those two young hobbits and guard them at the least even if you cannot find Frodo Come back to this spot if you find him or any traces of him I shall return soon Aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam Just as he reached the little lawn among the rowans he overtook him toiling uphill panting and calling _Frodo_ Come with me Sam he said None of us should be alone There is mischief about I feel it I am going to the top to the Seat of Amon Hen to see what may be seen And look It is as my heart guessed Frodo went this way Follow me and keep your eyes open He sped up the path Sam did his best but he could not keep up with Strider the Ranger and soon fell behind He had not gone far before Aragorn was out of sight ahead Sam stopped and puffed Suddenly he clapped his hand to his head Whoa Sam Gamgee he said aloud Your legs are too short so use your head Let me see now Boromir isnt lying thats not his way but he hasnt told us everything Something scared Mr Frodo badly He screwed himself up to the point sudden He made up his mind at last to go Where to Off East Not without Sam Yes without even his Sam Thats hard cruel hard Sam passed his hand over his eyes brushing away the tears Steady Gamgee he said Think if you can He cant fly across rivers and he cant jump waterfalls Hes got no gear So hes got to get back to the boats Back to the boats Back to the boats Sam like lightning Sam turned and bolted back down the path He fell and cut his knees Up he got and ran on He came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen by the shore where the boats were drawn up out of the water No one was there There seemed to be cries in the woods behind but he did not heed them He stood gazing for a moment stockstill gaping A boat was sliding down the bank all by itself With a shout Sam raced across the grass The boat slipped into the water Coming Mr Frodo Coming called Sam and flung himself from the bank clutching at the departing boat He missed it by a yard With a cry and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water Gurgling he went under and the River closed over his curly head An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat A paddle swirled and the boat put about Frodo was just in time to grasp Sam by the hair as he came up bubbling and struggling Fear was staring in his round brown eyes Up you come Sam my lad said Frodo Now take my hand Save me Mr Frodo gasped Sam Im drownded I cant see your hand Here it is Dont pinch lad I wont let you go Tread water and dont flounder or youll upset the boat There now get hold of the side and let me use the paddle With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank and Sam was able to scramble out wet as a waterrat Frodo took off the Ring and stepped ashore again Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst Sam he said Oh Mr Frodo thats hard said Sam shivering Thats hard trying to go without me and all If I hadnt a guessed right where would you be now Safely on my way Safely said Sam All alone and without me to help you I couldnt have a borne it itd have been the death of me It would be the death of you to come with me Sam said Frodo and I could not have borne that Not as certain as being left behind said Sam But I am going to Mordor I know that well enough Mr Frodo Of course you are And Im coming with you Now Sam said Frodo dont hinder me The others will be coming back at any minute If they catch me here I shall have to argue and explain and I shall never have the heart or the chance to get off But I must go at once Its the only way Of course it is answered Sam But not alone Im coming too or neither of us isnt going Ill knock holes in all the boats first Frodo actually laughed A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart Leave one he said Well need it But you cant come like this without your gear or food or anything Just hold on a moment and Ill get my stuff cried Sam eagerly Its all ready I thought we should be off today He rushed to the camping place fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it when he emptied the boat of his companions goods grabbed a spare blanket and some extra packages of food and ran back So all my plan is spoilt said Frodo It is no good trying to escape you But Im glad Sam I cannot tell you how glad Come along It is plain that we were meant to go together We will go and may the others find a safe road Strider will look after them I dont suppose we shall see them again Yet we may Mr Frodo We may said Sam So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together Frodo paddled away from the shore and the River bore them swiftly away down the western arm and past the frowning cliffs of Tol Brandir The roar of the great falls drew nearer Even with such help as Sam could give it was hard work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore At length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of Amon Lhaw There they found a shelving shore and they drew the boat out high above the water and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulder Then shouldering their burdens they set off seeking a path that would bring them over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil and down into the Land of Shadow _Here ends the first part of the history of the

the sage as his song descends like heavens rain or tears and washes the years the dust of the many stories from the High Tale of the Dragonlance For in ages deep past memory and word in the first blush of the world when the three moons rose from the lap of the forest dragons terrible and great made war on this world of Krynn Yet out of the darkness of dragons out of our cries for light in the blank face of the black moon soaring a banked light flared in Solamnia a knight of truth and of power who called down the gods themselves and forged the mighty Dragonlance piercing the soul of dragonkind driving the shade of their wings from the brightening shores of Krynn Thus Huma Knight of Solamnia Lightbringer First Lancer followed his light to the foot of the Khalkist Mountains to the stone feet of the gods to the crouched silence of their temple He called down the Lancemakers he took on their unspeakable power to crush the unspeakable evil to thrust the coiling darkness back down the tunnel of the dragons throat Paladine the Great God of Good shone at the side of Huma strengthening the lance of his strong right arm and Huma ablaze in a thousand moons banished the Queen of Darkness banished the swarm of her shrieking hosts back to the senseless kingdom of death where their curses swooped upon nothing and nothing deep below the brightening land Thus ended in thunder the Age of Dreams and began the Age of Might When Istar kingdom of light and truth arose in the east where minarets of white and gold spired to the sun and to the suns glory announcing the passing of evil and Istar who mothered and cradled the long summers of good shone like a meteor in the white skies of the just Yet in the fullness of sunlight the Kingpriest of Istar saw shadows At night he saw the trees as things with daggers the streams blackened and thickened under the silent moon He searched books for the paths of Huma for scrolls signs and spells so that he too might summon the gods might find their aid in his holy aims might purge the world of sin Then came the time of dark and death as the gods turned from the world A mountain of fire crashed like a comet through Istar the city split like a skull in the flames mountains burst from oncefertile valleys seas poured into the graves of mountains the deserts sighed on abandoned floors of the seas the highways of Krynn erupted and became the paths of the dead Thus began the Age of Despair The roads were tangled The winds and the sandstorms dwelt in the husks of cities The plains and mountains became our home As the old gods lost their power we called to the blank sky into the cold dividing gray to the ears of new gods The sky is calm silent unmoving We have yet to hear their answer The Old Man Tika Waylan straightened her back with a sigh flexing her shoulders to ease her cramped muscles She tossed the soapy bar rag into the water pail and glanced around the empty room It was getting harder to keep up the old inn There was a lot of love rubbed into the warm finish of the wood but even love and tallow couldnt hide the cracks and splits in the wellused tables or prevent a customer from sitting on an occasional splinter The Inn of the Last Home was not fancy not like some shed heard about in Haven It was comfortable The living tree in which it was built wrapped its ancient arms around it lovingly while the walls and fixtures were crafted around the boughs of the tree with such care as to make it impossible to tell where natures work left off and mans began The bar seemed to ebb and flow like a polished wave around the living wood that supported it The stained glass in the window panes cast welcoming flashes of vibrant color across the room Shadows were dwindling as noon approached The Inn of the Last Home would soon be open for business Tika looked around and smiled in satisfaction The tables were clean and polished All she had left to do was sweep the floor She began to shove aside the heavy wooden benches as Otik emerged from the kitchen enveloped in fragrant steam Should be another brisk dayfor both the weather and business he said squeezing his stout body behind the bar He began to set out mugs whistling cheerfully Id like the business cooler and the weather warmer said Tika tugging at a bench I walked my feet off yesterday and got little thanks and less tips Such a gloomy crowd Everybody nervous jumping at every sound I dropped a mug last night andI swearRetark drew his sword Pah Otik snorted Retarks a Solace Seeker Guard Theyre always nervous You would be too if you had to work for Hederick that fanat Watch it Tika warned Otik shrugged Unless the High Theocrat can fly now he wont be listening to us Id hear his boots on the stairs before he could hear me But Tika noticed he lowered his voice as he continued The residents of Solace wont put up with much more mark my words People disappearing being dragged off to who knows where Its a sad time He shook his head Then he brightened But its good for business Until he closes us down Tika said gloomily She grabbed the broom and began sweeping briskly Even theocrats need to fill their bellies and wash the fire and brimstone from their throats Otik chuckled It must be thirsty work haranguing people about the New Gods day in and day outhes in here every night Tika stopped her sweeping and leaned against the bar Otik she said seriously her voice subdued Theres other talk tootalk of war Armies massing in the north And there are these strange hooded men in town hanging around with the High Theocrat asking questions Otik looked at the nineteenyearold girl fondly reached out and patted her cheek Hed been father to her ever since her own had vanished so mysteriously He tweaked her red curls War Pooh He sniffed Theres been talk of war ever since the Cataclysm Its just talk girl Maybe the Theocrat makes it up just to keep people in line I dont know Tika frowned I The door opened Both Tika and Otik started in alarm and turned to the door They had not heard footsteps on the stairs and that was uncanny The Inn of the Last Home was built high in the branches of a mighty vallenwood tree as was every other building in Solace with the exception of the blacksmith shop The townspeople had decided to take to the trees during the terror and chaos following the Cataclysm And thus Solace became a tree town one of the few truly beautiful wonders left on Krynn Sturdy wooden bridgewalks connected the houses and businesses perched high above the ground where five hundred people went about their daily lives The Inn of the Last Home was the largest building in Solace and stood forty feet off the ground Stairs ran around the ancient vallenwoods gnarled trunk As Otik had said any visitor to the Inn would be heard approaching long before he was seen But neither Tika nor Otik had heard the old man He stood in the doorway leaning on a worn oak staff and peered around the Inn The tattered hood of his plain gray robe was drawn over his head its shadow obscuring the features of his face except for his hawkish shining eyes Can I help you Old One Tika asked the stranger exchanging worried glances with Otik Was this old man a Seeker spy Eh The old man blinked You open Well Tika hesitated Certainly Otik said smiling broadly Come in Graybeard Tika find our guest a chair He must be tired after that long climb Climb Scratching his head the old man glanced around the porch then looked down to the ground below Oh yes Climb A great many stairs He hobbled inside then made a playful swipe at Tika with his staff Get along with your work girl Im capable of finding my own chair Tika shrugged reached for her broom and began sweeping keeping her eyes on the old man He stood in the center of the Inn peering around as though confirming the location and position of each table and chair in the room The common room was large and beanshaped wrapping around the trunk of the vallenwood The trees smaller limbs supported the floor and ceiling He looked with particular interest at the fireplace which stood about threequarters of the way back into the room The only stonework in the Inn it was obviously crafted by dwarven hands to appear to be part of the tree winding naturally through the branches above A bin next to the side of the firepit was stacked high with cordwood and pine logs brought down from the high mountains No resident of Solace would consider burning the wood of their own great trees There was a back route out the kitchen it was a fortyfoot drop but a few of Otiks customers found this setup very convenient So did the old man He muttered satisfied comments to himself as his eyes went from one area to another Then to Tikas astonishment he suddenly dropped his staff hitched up the sleeves of his robes and began rearranging the furniture Tika stopped sweeping and leaned on her broom What are you doing That tables always been there A long narrow table stood in the center of the common room The old man dragged it across the floor and shoved it up against the trunk of the huge vallenwood right across from the firepit then stepped back to admire his work There he grunted Sposed to be closer to the firepit Now bring over two more chairs Need six around here Tika turned to Otik He seemed about to protest but at that moment there was a flaring light from the kitchen A scream from the cook indicated that the grease had caught fire again Otik hurried toward the swinging kitchen doors Hes harmless he puffed as he passed Tika Let him do what he wantswithin reason Maybe hes throwing a party Tika sighed and took two chairs over to the old man as requested She set them where he indicated Now the old man said glancing around sharply Bring two more chairscomfortable ones mind youover here Put them next to the firepit in this shadowy corner Tisnt shadowy Tika protested Its sitting in full sunlight Ahthe old mans eyes narrowedbut it will be shadowy tonight wont it When the fires lit II suppose so Tika faltered Bring the chairs Thats a good girl And I want one right here The old man gestured at a spot in front of the firepit For me Are you giving a party Old One Tika asked as she carriedmover the most comfortable wellworn chair in the Inn A party The thought seemed to strike the old man as funny He chuckled Yes girl It will be a party such as the world of Krynn has not seen since before the Cataclysm Be ready Tika Waylan Be ready He patted her shoulder tousled her hair then turned and lowered himself bones creaking into the chair A mug of ale he ordered Tika went to pour the ale It wasnt until she had brought the old man his drink and gone back to her sweeping that she stopped wondering how he knew her name BOOK Old friends meet A rude interruption Flint Fireforge collapsed on a mosscovered boulder His old dwarven bones had supported him long enough and were unwilling to continue without complaint I should never have left Flint grumbled looking down into the valley below He spoke aloud though there was no sign of another living person about Long years of solitary wandering had forced the dwarf into the habit of talking to himself He slapped both hands on his knees And Ill be damned if Im ever leaving again he announced vehemently Warmed by the afternoon sun the boulder felt comfortable to the ancient dwarf who had been walking all day in the chill autumn air Flint relaxed and let the warmth seep into his bonesthe warmth of the sun and the warmth of his thoughts Because he was home He looked around him his eyes lingering fondly over the familiar landscape The mountainside below him formed one side of a high mountain bowl carpeted in autumn splendor The vallenwood trees in the valley were ablaze in the seasons colors the brilliant reds and golds fading into the purple of the Kharolis peaks beyond The flawless azure sky among the trees was repeated in the waters of Crystalmir Lake Thin columns of smoke curled among the treetops the only sign of the presence of Solace A soft spreading haze blanketed the vale with the sweet aroma of home fires burning As Flint sat and rested he pulled a block of wood and a gleaming dagger from his pack his hands moving without conscious thought Since time uncounted his people had always had the need to shape the shapeless to their liking He himself had been a metalsmith of some renown before his retirement some years earlier He put the knife to the wood then his attention caught Flints hands remained idle as he watched the smoke drift up from the hidden chimneys below My own home fires gone out Flint said softly He shook himself angry at feeling sentimental and began slicing at the wood with a vengeance He grumbled loudly My house has been sitting empty Roof probably leaked ruined the furniture Stupid quest Silliest thing I ever did After one hundred and fortyeight years I ought to have learned Youll never learn dwarf a distant voice answered him Not if you live to be two hundred and fortyeight Dropping the wood the dwarfs hand moved with calm assurance from the dagger to the handle of his axe as he peered down the path The voice sounded familiar the first familiar voice hed heard in a long time But he couldnt place it Flint squinted into the setting sun He thought he saw the figure of a man striding up the path Standing Flint drew back into the shadow of a tall pine to see better The mans walk was marked by an easy gracean elvish grace Flint would have said yet the mans body had the thickness and tight muscles of a human while the facial hair was definitely humankinds All the dwarf could see of the mans face beneath a green hood was tan skin and a brownishred beard A longbow was slung over one shoulder and a sword hung at his left side He was dressed in soft leather carefully tooled in the intricate designs the elves loved But no elf in the world of Krynn could grow a beard no elf but Tanis said Flint hesitantly as the man neared The same The newcomers bearded face split in a wide grin He held open his arms and before the dwarf could stop him engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted him off the ground The dwarf clasped his old friend close for a brief instant then remembering his dignity squirmed and freed himself from the halfelfs embrace Well youve learned no manners in five years the dwarf grumbled Still no respect for my age or my station Hoisting me around like a sack of potatoes Flint peered down the road I hope no one who knows us saw us I doubt there are many whod remember us Tanis said his eyes studying his stocky friend fondly Time doesnt pass for you and me old dwarf as it does for humans Five years is a long time for them a few moments for us Then he smiled You havent changed The same cant be said of others Flint sat back down on the stone and began to carve once more He scowled up at Tanis Why the beard You were ugly enough Tanis scratched his chin I have been in lands that were not friendly to those of elven blood The bearda gift from my human father he said with bitter irony did much to hide my heritage Flint grunted He knew that wasnt the complete truth Although the halfelf abhorred killing Tanis would not be one to hide from a fight behind a beard Wood chips flew I have been in lands that were not friendly to anyone of any kind of blood Flint turned the wood in his hand examining it But were home now All thats behind us Not from what Ive heard Tanis said drawing his hood up over his face again to keep the sun out of his eyes The Highseekers in Haven appointed a man named Hederick to govern as High Theocrat in Solace and hes turned the town into a hotbed of fanaticism with his new religion Tanis and the dwarf both turned and looked down into the quiet valley Lights began to wink on making the homes in the trees visible among the vallenwood The night air was still and calm and sweet tinged with the smell of wood smoke from the home fires Now and again they could hear the faint sound of a mother calling her children to dinner Ive heard of no evil in Solace Flint said quietly Religious persecution inquisitions Taniss voice sounded ominous coming from the depths of his hood It was deeper more somber than Flint remembered The dwarf frowned His friend had changed in five years And elves never change But then Tanis was only halfelvena child of violence his mother having been raped by a human warrior during one of the many wars that had divided the different races of Krynn in the chaotic years following the Cataclysm Inquisitions Thats only for those who defy the new High Theocrat according to rumor Flint snorted I dont believe in the Seeker godsnever didbut I dont parade my beliefs in the street Keep quiet and theyll let you alonethats my motto The Highseekers in Haven are still wise and virtuous men Its just this one rotten apple in Solace thats spoiling the whole barrel By the way did you find what you sought Some sign of the ancient true gods Tanis asked Or peace of mind I went seeking both Which did you mean Well I assume one would go with the other Flint growled He turned the piece of wood in his hands still not satisfied with its proportions Are we going to stand here all night smelling the cooking fires Or are we going to go into town and get some dinner Go Tanis waved The two started down the path together Taniss long strides forcing the dwarf to take two steps to his one Though it had been many years since they had journeyed together Tanis unconsciously slowed his pace while Flint unconsciously quickened his So you found nothing Flint pursued Nothing Tanis replied As we discovered long ago the only clerics and priests in this world serve false gods I heard tales of healing but it was all trickery and magic Fortunately our friend Raistlin taught me what to watch Raistlin Flint puffed That pastyfaced skinny magician Hes more than half charlatan himself Always sniveling and whining and poking his nose where it doesnt belong If it werent for his twin brother looking after him someone wouldve put an end to his magic long ago Tanis was glad his beard hid his smile I think the young man was a better magician than you give him credit for he said And you must admit he worked long and tirelessly to help those who were taken in by the fake clericsas I did He sighed For which you got little thanks no doubt the dwarf muttered Very little Tanis said People want to believe in somethingeven if deep inside they know it is false But what of you How was your journey to your homelands Flint stumped along without answering his face grim Finally he muttered I should never have gone and glanced up at Tanis his eyesbarely visible through the thick overhanging white eyebrows informing the halfelf that this turn of the conversation was not welcome Tanis saw the look but asked his questions anyhow What of the dwarven clerics The stories we heard Not true The clerics vanished three hundred years ago during the Cataclysm So say the elders Much like the elves Tanis mused I saw Hsst Tanis held out a warning hand Flint came to a dead stop What he whispered Tanis motioned Over in that grove Flint peered toward the trees at the same time reaching for the battleaxe that was strapped behind his back The red rays of the setting sun glistened briefly on a piece of metal flashing among the trees Tanis saw it once lost it then saw it again At that moment though the sun sank leaving the sky glowing a rich violet and causing nights shadows to creep through the forest trees Flint squinted into the gloom I dont see anything I did Tanis said He kept staring at the place where hed seen the metal and gradually his elvensight began to detect the warm red aura cast by all living beings but visible only to the elves Who goes there Tanis called The only answer for long moments was an eerie sound that made the hair rise on the halfelfs neck It was a hollow whirring sound that started out low then grew higher and higher and eventually attained a highpitched screaming whine Soaring with it came a voice Elven wanderer turn from your course and leave the dwarf behind We are the spirits of those poor souls Flint Fireforge left on the barroom floor Did we die in combat The spirit voice soared to new heights as did the whining whirring sound accompanying it No We died of shame cursed by the ghost of the grape for not being able to outdrink a hill dwarf Flints beard was quivering with rage and Tanis bursting out laughing was forced to grab the angry dwarfs shoulder to keep him from charging headlong into the brush Damn the eyes of the elves The spectral voice turned merry And damn the beards of the dwarves Wouldnt you know it Flint groaned Tasslehoff Burrfoot There was a faint rustle in the underbrush then a small figure stood on the path It was a kender one of a race of people considered by many on Krynn to be as much a nuisance as mosquitoes Smallboned the kender rarely grew over four feet tall This particular kender was about Flints height but his slight build and perpetually childlike face made him seem smaller He wore bright blue leggings that stood out in sharp contrast to his furred vest and plain homespun tunic His brown eyes glinted with mischief and fun his smile seemed to reach to the tips of his pointed ears He dipped his head in a mock bow allowing a long tassle of brown hairhis pride and joyto flip forward over his nose Then he straightened up laughing The metallic gleam Taniss quick eyes had spotted came from the buckles of one of the numerous packs strapped around his shoulders and waist Tas grinned up at them leaning on his hoopak staff It was this staff that had created the eerie noise Tanis should have recognized it at once having seen the kender scare off many wouldbe attackers by whirling his staff in the air producing that screaming whine A kender invention the hoopaks bottom end was copperclad and sharply pointed the top end was forked and held a leather sling The staff itself was made out of a single piece of supple willow wood Although scorned by every other race on Krynn the hoopak was more than a useful tool or weapon to a kenderit was his symbol New roads demand a hoopak was a popular saying among kenderkind It was always followed immediately by another of their sayings No road is ever old Tasslehoff suddenly ran forward his arms open wide Flint The kender threw his arms around the dwarf and hugged him Flint embarrassed returned the embrace reluctantly then quickly stepped back Tasslehoff grinned then looked up at the halfelf Whos this He gasped Tanis I didnt recognize you with a beard He held out his short arms No thanks said Tanis grinning He waved the kender away I want to keep my money pouch With a sudden look of alarm Flint felt under his tunic You rascal He roared and leaped at the kender who was doubled over laughing The two went down in the dust Tanis chuckling started to pull Flint off the kender Then he stopped and turned in alarm Too late he heard the silvery jingle of harness and bridle and the whinny of a horse The halfelf put his hand on the hilt of his sword but he had already lost any advantage he might have gained through alertness Swearing under his breath Tanis could do nothing but stand and stare at the figure emerging from the shadows It was seated on a small furrylegged pony that walked with its head down as if it were ashamed of its rider Gray mottled skin sagged into folds about the riders face Two pigpink eyes stared out at them from beneath a militarylooking helmet Its fat flabby body leaked out between pieces of flashy pretentious armor A peculiar odor hit Tanis and he wrinkled his nose in disgust Hobgoblin his brain registered He loosened his sword and kicked at Flint but at that moment the dwarf gave a tremendous sneeze and sat up on the kender Horse said Flint sneezing again Behind you Tanis replied quietly Flint hearing the warning note in his friends voice scrarnbled to his feet Tasslehoff quickly did the same The hobgoblin sat astride the pony watching them with a sneering supercilious look on his flat face His pink eyes reflected the last lingering traces of sunlight You see boys the hobgoblin stated speaking the Common Tongue with a thick accent what fools we are dealing with here in Solace There was gritty laughter from the trees behind the hobgoblin Five goblin guards dressed in crude uniforms came out on foot They took up positions on either side of their leaders horse Now The hobgoblin leaned over his saddle Tanis watched with a kind of horrible fascination as the creatures huge belly completely engulfed the pommel I am Fewmaster Toede leader of the forces that are keeping Solace protected from undesirable elements You have no right to be walking in the city limits after dark You are under arrest Fewmaster Toede leaned down to speak to a goblin near him Bring me the blue crystal staff if you find it on them he said in the croaking goblin tongue Tanis Flint and Tasslehoff all looked at each other questioningly Each of them could speak some goblinTas better than the others Had they heard right A blue crystal staff If they resist added Fewmaster Toede switching back to Common for grand effect kill them With that he yanked on the reins flicked his mount with a riding crop and galloped off down the path toward town Goblins In Solace This new Theocrat has much to answer for Flint spat Reaching up he swung his battleaxe from its holder on his back and planted his feet firmly on the path rocking back and forth until he felt himself balanced Very well he announced Come on I advise you to retreat Tanis said throwing his cloak over one shoulder and drawing his sword We have had a long journey We are hungry and tired and late for a meeting with friends we have not seen in a long time We have no intention of being arrested Or of being killed added Tasslehoff He had drawn no weapon but stood staring at the goblins with interest A bit taken aback the goblins glanced at each other nervously One cast a baleful look down the road where his leader had vanished The goblins were accustomed to bullying peddlers and farmers traveling to the small townnot to challenging armed and obviously skilled fighters But their hatred of the other races of Krynn was longstanding They drew their long curved blades Flint strode forward his hands getting a firm grip on the axe handle Theres only one creature I hate worse than a gully dwarf he muttered and thats a goblin The goblin dove at Flint hoping to knock him down Flint swung his axe with deadly accuracy and timing A goblin head rolled into the dust the body crashing to the ground What are you slime doing in Solace Tanis asked meeting the clumsy stab of another goblin skillfully Their swords crossed and held for a moment then Tanis shoved the goblin backward Do you work for the High Theocrat Theocrat The goblin gurgled with laughter Swinging its weapon wildly it ran at Tanis That fool Our Fewmaster works for theugh The creature impaled itself on Taniss sword It groaned then slid off onto the ground Damn Tanis swore and stared at the dead goblin in frustration The clumsy idiot I didnt want to kill itjust find out who hired it Youll find out who hired ussooner than youd like snarled another goblin rushing at the distracted halfelf Tanis turned quickly and disarmed the creature He kicked it in its stomach and the goblin crumpled over Another goblin sprang at Flint before the dwarf had time to recover from his lethal swing He staggered backward trying to regain his balance Then Tasslehoffs shrill voice rang out These scum will fight for anyone Tanis Throw them some dog meat once in a while and theyre yours forev Dog meat The goblin croaked and turned from Flint in a rage How about kender meat you little squeaker The goblin flapped toward the apparently unarmed kender its purplish red hands grasping for his neck Tas without ever losing the innocent childlike expression on his face reached into his fleecy vest whipped out a dagger and threw itall in one motion The goblin clutched his chest and fell with a groan There was a sound of flapping feet as the remaining goblin fled The battle was over Tanis sheathed his sword grimacing in disgust at the stinking bodies the smell reminded him of rotting fish Flint wiped black goblin blood from his axe blade Tas stared mournfully at the body of the goblin he killed It had fallen facedown his dagger buried underneath Ill get it for you Tanis offered preparing to roll the body over No Tas made a face I dont want it back You can never get rid of the smell you know Tanis nodded Flint fastened his axe in its carrier again and the three continued on down the path The lights of Solace grew brighter as darkness deepened The smell of the wood smoke on the chill night air brought thoughts of food and warmthand safety The companions hurried their steps They did not speak for a long time each hearing Flints words echo in his mind Goblins In Solace Finally however the irrepressible kender giggled Besides he said that dagger was Flints Return to the Inn A shock The oath is broken Nearly everyone in Solace managed to drop into the Inn of the Last Home sometime during the evening hours these days People felt safer in crowds Solace had long been a crossroads for travelers They came northeast from Haven the Seeker capital They came from the elven kingdom of Qualinesti to the south Sometimes they came from the east across the barren Plains of Abanasinia Throughout the civilized world the Inn of the Last Home was known as a travelers refuge and center for news It was to the Inn that the three friends turned their steps The huge convoluted trunk rose through the surrounding trees Against the shadow of the vallenwood the colored panes of the Inns stainedglass windows glittered brightly and sounds of life drifted down from the windows Lanterns hanging from the tree limbs lit the winding stairway Though the autumn night was settling chill amid the vallenwoods of Solace the travelers felt the companionship and memories warm the soul and wash away the aches and sorrows of the road The Inn was so crowded on this night that the three were continually forced to stand aside on the stairs to let men women and children pass them Tanis noticed that people glanced at him and his companions with suspicionnot with the welcoming looks they would have given five years ago Taniss face grew grim This was not the homecoming he had dreamed about Never in the fifty years he had lived in Solace had he felt such tension The rumors he had heard about the malignant corruption of the Seekers must be true Five years ago the men calling themselves seekers we seek the new gods had been a looseknit organization of clerics practicing their new religion in the towns of Haven Solace and Gateway These clerics had been misguided Tanis believed but at least they had been honest and sincere In the intervening years however the clerics had gained more and more status as their religion flourished Soon they became concerned not so much with glory in the afterlife as with power on Krynn They took over the governing of the towns with the peoples blessing A touch on Taniss arm interrupted his thoughts He turned and saw Flint silently pointing below Looking down Tanis saw guards marching past walking in parties of four Armed to the teeth they strutted with an air of selfimportance At least theyre humannot goblin Tas said That goblin sneered when I mentioned the High Theocrat Tanis mused As if they were working for someone else I wonder whats going on Maybe our friends will know Flint said If theyre here Tasslehoff added A lot could have happened in five years Theyll be hereif theyre alive Flint added in an undertone It was a sacred oath we tookto meet again after five years had passed and report what we had found out about the evil spreading in the world To think we should come home and find evil on our very doorsteps Hush Shss Several passersby looked so alarmed at the dwarfs words that Tanis shook his head Better not talk about it here the halfelf advised Reaching the top of the stairs Tas flung the door open wide A wave of light noise heat and the familiar smell of Otiks spicy potatoes hit them full in the face It engulfed them and washed over them soothingly Otik standing behind the bar as they always remembered him hadnt changed except maybe to grow stouter The Inn didnt appear to have changed either except to grow more comfortable Tasslehoff his quick kender eyes sweeping the crowd gave a yell and pointed across the room Something else hadnt changed eitherthe firelight gleaming on a brightly polished winged dragon helm Who is it asked Flint straining to see Caramon Tanis replied Then Raistlinll be here too Flint said without a great deal of warmth in his voice Tasslehoff was already sliding through the muttering knots of people his small lithe body barely noticed by those he passed Tanis hoped fervently the kender wasnt acquiring any objects from the Inns customers Not that he stole things Tasslehoff would have been deeply hurt if anyone had accused him of theft But the kender had an insatiable curiosity and various interesting items belonging to other people had a way of falling into Tass possession The last thing Tanis wanted tonight was trouble He made a mental note to have a private word with the kender The halfelf and the dwarf made their way through the crowd with less ease than their little friend Nearly every chair was taken every table filled Those who could not find room to sit down were standing talking in low voices People looked at Tanis and Flint darkly suspiciously or curiously No one greeted Flint although there were several who had been longstanding customers of the dwarven metalsmith The people of Solace had their own problems and it was apparent that Tanis and Flint were now considered outsiders A roar sounded from across the room from the table where the dragon helm lay reflecting light from the firepit Taniss grim face relaxed into a smile as he saw the giant Caramon lift little Tas off the floor in a bear hug Flint wading through a sea of belt buckles could only imagine the sight as he listened to Caramons booming voice answering Tasslehoffs piping greeting Caramon better look to his purse Flint grumbled Or count his teeth The dwarf and the halfelf finally broke through the press of people in front of the long bar The table where Caramon sat was shoved back against the tree trunk In fact it was sitting in an odd position Tanis wondered why Otik had moved it when everything else remained exactly the same But the thought was crushed out of him for it was his turn to receive the big warriors affectionate greeting Tanis hastily removed the longbow and quiver of arrows from his back before Caramon hugged them into kindling My friend Caramons eyes were wet He seemed about to say more but was overcome by emotion Tanis was also momentarily unable to talk but this was because hed had his breath sqeezed out of him by Caramons muscular arms Wheres Raistlin he asked when he could talk The twins were never far apart There Caramon nodded toward the end of the table Then he frowned Hes changed the warrior warned Tanis The halfelf looked into a corner formed by an irregularity of the vallenwood tree The corner was shrouded in shadow and for a moment he couldnt see anything after the glare of the firelight Then he saw a slight figure sitting huddled in red robes even in the heat of the nearby fire The figure had a hood cast over its face Tanis felt a sudden reluctance to speak to the young mage alone but Tasslehoff had flitted away to find the barmaid and Flint was being lifted off his feet by Caramon Tanis moved to the end of the table Raistlin he said feeling a strange sense of foreboding The robed figure looked up Tanis the man whispered as he slowly pulled the hood off his head The halfelf sucked in his breath and fell back a pace He stared in horror The face that turned toward him from the shadows was a face out of a nightmare Changed Caramon had said Tanis shuddered Change wasnt the word The mages white skin had turned a golden color It glistened in the firelight with a faintly metallic quality looking like a gruesome mask The flesh had melted from the face leaving the cheekbones outlined in dreadful shadows The lips were pulled tight in a dark straight line But it was the mans eyes that arrested Tanis and held him pinned in their terrible gaze For the eyes were no longer the eyes of any living human Tanis had ever seen The black pupils were now the shape of hourglasses The pale blue irises Tanis remembered now glittered gold I see my appearance startles you Raistlin whispered There was a faint suggestion of a smile on his thin lips Sitting down across from the young man Tanis swallowed In the name of the true gods Raistlin Flint plopped into a seat next to Tanis Ive been hoisted into the air more times today thanReorx Flints eyes widened What evils at work here Are you cursed The dwarf gasped staring at Raistlin Caramon took a seat next to his brother He picked up his mug of ale and glanced at Raistlin Will you tell them Raist he said in a low voice Yes Raistlin said drawing the word out into a hiss that made Tanis shiver The young man spoke in a soft wheezing voice barely above a whisper as if it were all he could do to force the words out of his body His long nervous hands which were the same golden color as his face toyed absently with uneaten food on a plate before him Do you remember when we parted five years ago Raistlin began My brother and I planned a journey so secret I could not even tell you my dear friends where we were going There was a faint note of sarcasm in the gentle voice Tanis bit his lip Raistlin had neverin his entire lifehad any dear friends I had been selected by ParSalian the head of my order to take the Test Raistlin continued The Test Tanis repeated stunned But you were too young Whattwenty The Test is given only to mages who have studied years and years You can imagine my pride Raistlin said coldly irritated at the interruption My brother and I traveled to the secret placethe fabled Towers of High Sorcery And there I passed the Test The mages voice sank And there I nearly died Caramon choked obviously in the grip of some strong emotion It was awful the big man began his voice shaking I found him in that horrible place blood flowing from his mouth dying I picked him up and Enough brother Raistlins soft voice flicked like a whip Caramon flinched Tanis saw the young mages golden eyes narrow the thin hands clench Caramon fell silent and gulped down his ale glancing nervously at his brother There was clearly a new strain a tension between the twins Raistlin drew a deep breath and continued When I awoke the mage said my skin had turned this colora mark of my suffering My body and my health are irretrievably shattered And my eyes I see through hourglass pupils and therefore I see timeas it affects all things Even as I look at you now Tanis the mage whispered I see you dying slowly by inches And so I see every living thing Raistlins thin clawlike hand gripped Taniss arm The halfelf shivered at the cold touch and started to pull away but the golden eyes and the cold hand held him fast The mage leaned forward his eyes glowing feverishly But I have power now he whispered ParSalian told me the day would come when my strength would shape the world I have power andhe gesturedthe Staff of Magius Tanis looked to see a staff leaning against the vallenwood trunk within easy reach of Raistlins hand It was a plain wooden staff A ball of bright crystal clutched in a disembodied golden claw carved to resemble the talon of a dragon gleamed at the top Was it worth it Tanis asked quietly Raistlin stared at him then his lips parted in a caricature of a grin He withdrew his hand from Taniss arm and folded his arms in the sleeves of his robe Of course the mage hissed Power is what I have long soughtand still seek He leaned back and his thin figure melted into the dark shadow until all Tanis could see were the golden eyes glittering in the firelight Ale said Flint clearing his throat and licking his lips as if he would wash a bad taste out of his mouth Where is that kender I suppose he stole the barmaid Here we are cried Tass cheerful voice A tall young redhaired girl loomed behind him carrying a tray of mugs Caramon grinned Now Tanis he boomed guess who this is You too Flint If you win Ill buy this round Glad to take his mind off Raistlins dark tale Tanis stared at the laughing girl Red hair curled around her face her green eyes danced with fun freckles were lightly smattered across her nose and cheeks Tanis seemed to remember the eyes but beyond that he was blank I give up he said But then to elves humans seem to change so rapidly that we lose track I am one hundred and two yet seem no more than thirty to you And to me those hundred years seem as thirty This young woman must have been a child when we left I was fourteen The girl laughed and set the tray down on the table And Caramon used to say I was so ugly my father would have to pay someone to marry me Tika Flint slammed his fist on the table Youre buying you great oaf He pointed at Caramon No fair The giant laughed She gave you a clue Well the years have proved him wrong Tanis said smiling Ive traveled many roads and youre one of the prettiest girls Ive seen on Krynn Tika blushed with pleasure Then her face darkened By the way Tanisshe reached in her pocket and drew forth a cylindrical objectthis arrived for you today Under strange circumstances Tanis frowned and reached for the object It was a small scrollcase made of black highly polished wood He slowly removed a thin piece of parchment and unrolled it His heart thudded painfully at sight of the bold black handwriting Its from Kitiara he said finally knowing his voice sounded strained and unnatural Shes not coming There was a moments silence Thats done it Flint said The circle is broken the oath denied Bad luck He shook his head Bad luck Knight of Solamnia The old mans party Raistlin leaned forward He and Caramon exchanged glances as thoughts passed wordlessly between them It was a rare moment for only great personal difficulty or danger ever made the twins close kinship apparent Kitiara was their older halfsister Kitiara would not break her oath unless another stronger oath bound her Raistlin spoke their thoughts aloud What does she say Caramon asked Tanis hesitated then licked his dry lips Her duties with her new lord keep her busy She sends her regrets and best wishes to all of us and her love Tanis felt his throat constrict He coughed Her love to her brothers and to He paused then foiled up the parchment Thats all Love to who Tasslehoff asked brightly Ouch He glared at Flint who had trod upon his foot The kender saw Tanis flush Oh he said feeling stupid Do you know who she means Tanis asked the brothers What new lord does she talk about Who knows with Kitiara Raistlin shrugged his thin shoulders The last time we saw her was here in the Inn five years ago She was going north with Sturm We have not heard from her since As for the new lord Id say we now know why she broke her oath to us she has sworn allegiance to another She is after all a mercenary Yes Tanis admitted He slipped the scroll back into its case and looked up at Tika You say this arrived under strange circumstances Tell me A man brought it in late this morning At least I think it was a man Tika shivered He was wrapped head to foot in clothing of every description I couldnt even see his face His voice was hissinglike and he spoke with a strange accent Deliver this to one Tanis HalfElven he said I told him you werent here and hadnt been here for several years He will be the man said Then he left Tika shrugged Thats all I can tell you The old man over there saw him She gestured to an old man sitting in a chair before the fire You might ask him if he noticed anything else Tanis turned to look at an old man who was telling stories to a dreamyeyed child staring into the flames Flint touched his arm Here comes one who can tell you more the dwarf said Sturm Tanis said warmly turning toward the door Everyone except Raistlin turned The mage relapsed into the shadows once more At the door stood a straightbacked figure dressed in full plate armor and chain mail the symbol of the Order of the Rose on the breastplate A great many people in the Inn turned to stare scowling The man was a Solamnic Knight and the Knights of Solamnia had fallen into illrepute up north Rumors of their corruption had spread even this far south The few who recognized Stunn as a longtime former resident of Solace shrugged and turned back to their drinking Those who did not continued to stare In these days of peace it was unusual enough to see a knight in full armor enter the Inn But it was still more unusual to see a knight in full armor that dated back practically to the Cataclysm Sturm received the stares as accolades due his rank He carefully smoothed his great thick moustaches which being the agesold symbol of the Knights were as obsolete as his armor He bore the trappings of the Solamnic Knights with unquestioned prideand he had the swordarm and the skill to defend that pride Although people in the Inn stared no one after one look at the knights calm cold eyesdared snicker or make a derogatory comment The knight held the door open for a tall man and a woman heavily cloaked in furs The woman must have spoken a word of thanks to Sturm for he bowed to her in a courtly old fashioned manner long dead in the modern world Look at that Caramon shook his head in admiration The gallant knight helps the lady fair I wonder where he dragged up those two Theyre barbarians from the Plains said Tas standing on a chair waving his arms to his friend Thats the dress of the Queshu tribe Apparently the two Plainsmen declined any offer Sturm made for the knight bowed again and left them He walked across the crowded Inn with a proud and noble air such as he might have worn walking forward to be knighted by the king Tanis rose to his feet Sturm came to him first and threw his arms around his friend Tanis gripped him tightly feeling the knights strong sinewy arms clasp him in affection Then the two stood back to look at each other for a brief moment Sturm hasnt changed Tanis thought except that there are more lines around the sad eyes more gray in the brown hair The cloak is a little more frayed There are a few more dents in the ancient armor But the knights flowing moustacheshis pride and joywere as long and sweeping as ever his shield was polished just as brightly his brown eyes were just as warm when he saw his friends And you have a beard Sturm said with amusement Then the knight turned to greet Caramon and Flint Tasslehoff dashed off after more ale Tika having been called away to serve others in the growing crowd Greetings Knight whispered Raistlin from his corner Sturms face grew solemn as he turned to greet the other twin Raistlin he said The mage drew back his hood letting the light fall on his face Sturm was too wellbred to let his astonishment show beyond a slight exclamation But his eyes widened Tanis realized the young mage was getting a cynical pleasure out of seeing his friends discomfiture Can I get you something Raistlin Tanis asked No thank you the mage answered moving into the shadows once again He eats practically nothing Caramon said in a worried tone I think he lives on air Some plants live on air Tasslehoff stated returning with Sturms ale Ive seen them They hover up off the ground Their roots suck food and water out of the atmosphere Really Caramons eyes were wide I dont know whos the greater idiot said Flint in disgust Well were all here What news All Sturm looked at Tanis questioningly Kitiara Not coming Tanis replied steadily We were hoping perhaps you could tell us something Not I The knight frowned We traveled north together and parted soon after crossing the Sea Narrows into Old Solamnia She was going to look up relatives of her father she said That was the last I saw of her Well I suppose thats that Tanis sighed What of your relatives Sturm Did you find your father Sturm began to talk but Tanis only halflistened to Sturms tale of his travels in his ancestral land of Solamnia Taniss thoughts were on Kitiara Of all his friends she had been the one he most longed to see After five years of trying to get her dark eyes and crooked smile out of his mind he discovered that his longing for her grew daily Wild impetuous hottempered the swordswoman was everything Tanis was not She was also human and love between human and elf always ended in tragedy Yet Tanis could no more get Kitiara out of his heart than he could get his human half out of his blood Wrenching his mind free of memories he began listening to Sturm I heard rumors Some say my father is dead Some say hes alive His face darkened But no one knows where he is Your inheritance Caramon asked Sturm smiled a melancholy smile that softened the lines in his proud face I wear it he replied simply My armor and my weapon Tanis looked down to see that the knight wore a splendid if oldfashioned twohanded sword Caramon stood up to peer over the table Thats a beauty he said They dont make them like that these days My sword broke in a fight with an ogre Theros Ironfeld put a new blade on it today but it cost me dearly So youre a knight now Sturms smile vanished Ignoring the question he caressed the hilt of his sword lovingly According to the legend this sword will break only if I do he said It was all that was left of my fathers Suddenly Tas who hadnt been listening interrupted Who are those people the kender asked in a shrill whisper Tanis looked up as the two barbarians walked past their table heading for empty chairs that sat in the shadows of a corner near the firepit The man was the tallest man Tanis had ever seen Caramonat six feetwould come only to this mans shoulder But Caramons chest was probably twice as big around his arms three times as big Although the man was bundled with the furs barbarian tribesmen live in it was obvious that he was thin for his great height His face though darkskinned had the pale cast of one who has been ill or suffered greatly His companionthe woman Sturm had bowed towas so muffled in a furtrimmedcape and hood that it was difficult to tell much about her Neither she nor her tall escort glanced at Sturm as they passed The woman carried a plain staff trimmed with feathers in barbaric fashion The man carried a wellworn knapsack They sat down in the chairs huddled in their cloaks and talked together in low voices I found them wandering around on the road outside of town Sturm said The woman appeared near exhaustion the man just as bad I brought them here told them they could get food and rest for the night They are proud people and would have refused my help I think but they were lost and tired andSturm lowered his voicethere are things on the road these days that it is better not to face in the dark We met some of them asking about a staff Tanis said grimly He described their encounter with Fewmaster Toede Although Sturm smiled at the description of the battle he shook his head A Seeker guard questioned me about a staff outside he said Blue crystal wasnt it Caramon nodded and put his hand on his brothers thin arm One of the slimy guards stopped us the warrior said They were going to impound Raists staff if youll believe thatfor further investigation they said I rattled my sword at them and they thought better of the notion Raistlin moved his arm from his brothers touch a scornful smile on his lips What would have happened if they had taken your staff Tanis asked Raistlin The mage looked at him from the shadows of his hood his golden eyes gleaming They would have died horribly the mage whispered and not by my brothers sword The halfelf felt chilled The mages softly spoken words were more frightening than his brothers bravado I wonder what is so important about a blue crystal staff that goblins would kill to get it Tanis mused There are rumors of worse to come Sturm said quietly His friends moved closer to hear him Armies are gathering in the north Armies of strange creaturesnot human There is talk of war But what Who Tanis asked Ive heard the same And so have I Caramon added In fact I heard As the conversation continued Tasslehoff yawned and turned away Easily bored the kender looked around the Inn for some new amusement His eyes went to the old man still spinning tales for the child by the fire The old man had a larger audience nowthe two barbarians were listening Tas noted Then his jaw dropped The woman had thrown her hood back and the firelight shone on her face and hair The kender stared in admiration The womans face was like the face of a marble statueclassic pure cold But it was her hair that captured the kenders attention Tas had never before seen such hair especially on the Plainsmen who were usually darkhaired and darkskinned No jeweler spinning molten strands of silver and gold could have created the effect of this womans silvergold hair shining in the firelight One other person listened to the old man This was a man dressed in the rich brown and golden robes of a Seeker He sat at a small round table drinking mulled wine Several mugs stood empty before him and even as the kender watched he called sourly for another Thats Hederick Tika whispered as she passed the companions table The High Theocrat The man called out again glaring at Tika She bustled quickly over to help him He snarled at her mentioning poor service She seemed to start to answer sharply then bit her lip and kept silent The old man came to an end of his tale The boy sighed Are all your stories of the ancient gods true Old One he aske curiously Tasslehoff saw Hederick frown The kender hoped he wouldnt bother the old man Tas touched Taniss arm to catch his attention nodding his head toward the Seeker with a look that meant there might be trouble The friends turned All were immediately overwhelmed by the beauty of the Plainswoman They stared in silence The old mans voice carried clearly over the drone of the other conversation in the common room Indeed my stories are true child The old man looked directly at the woman and her tall escort Ask these two They carry such stories in their hearts Do you The boy turned to the woman eagerly Can you tell me a story The woman shrank back into the shadows her face filled with alarm as she noticed Tanis and his friends staring at her The man drew near her protectively his hand reaching for his weapon He glowered at the group especially the heavily armed warrior Caramon Nervous bastard Caramon commented his hand straying to his own sword I can understand why Sturm said Guarding such a treasure He is her bodyguard by the way I gathered from their conversation that shes some kind of royal person in their tribe Though I imagine from the looks they exchanged that their relationship goes a bit deeper than that The woman raised her hand in a gesture of protest Im sorry The friends had to strain to hear her low voice I am not a teller of tales I have not the art She spoke the Common tongue her accent thick The childs eager face filled with disappointment The old man patted him on the back then looked directly into the womans eyes You may not be a teller of tales he said pleasantly but you are a singer of songs arent you Chieftains Daughter Sing the child your song Goldmoon You know the one From out of nowhere apparently a lute appeared in the old mans hands He gave it to the woman who stared at him in fear and astonishment How do you know me sir she asked That is not important The old man smiled gently Sing for us Chieftains Daughter The woman took the lute with hands that trembled visibly Her companion seemed to make a whispered protest but she did not hear him Her eyes were held fast by the glittering black eyes of the old man Slowly as if in a trance she began to strum the lute As the melancholy chords drifted through the common room conversations ceased Soon everyone was watching her but she did not notice Goldmoon sang for the old man alone The grasslands are endless And summer sings on And Goldmoon the princess Loves a poor mans son Her father the chieftain Makes long roads between them The grasslands are endless and summer sings on The grasslands are waving The skys rim is gray The chieftain sends Riverwind East and away To search for strong magic At the lip of the morning The grasslands are waving the skys rim is gray O Riverwind where have you gone O Riverwind autumn comes on I sit by the river And look to the sunrise But the sun rises over the mountains alone The grasslands are fading The summer wind dies He comes back the darkness Of stones in his eyes He carries a blue staff As bright as a glacier The grasslands are fading the summer wind dies The grasslands are fragile As yellow as flame The chieftain makes mockery Of Riverwinds claim He orders the people To stone the young warrior The grasslands are fragile as yellow as flame The grassland has faded And autumn is here The girl joins her lover The stones whistle near The staff flares in blue light And both of them vanish The grasslands are faded and autumn is here There was heavy silence in the room as her hand struck the final chord Taking a deep breath she handed the lute back to the old man and withdrew into the shadows once more Thank you my dear the old man said smiling Now can I have a story the little boy asked wistfully Of course the old man answered and settled back in his chair Once upon a time the great god Paladine Paladine the child interrupted Ive never heard of a god named Paladine A snorting sound came from the High Theocrat sitting at the nearby table Tanis looked at Hederick whose face was flushed and scowling The old man appeared not to notice Paladine is one of the ancient gods child No one has worshipped him for a long time Why did he leave the little boy asked He did not leave us the old man answered and his smile grew sad Men left him after the dark days of the Cataclysm They blamed the destruction of the world on the gods instead of on themselves as they should have done Have you ever heard the Canticle of the Dragon Oh yes the boy said eagerly I love stories about dragons though papa says dragons never existed I believe in them though I hope to see one someday The old mans face seemed to age and grow sorrowful He stroked the young boys hair Be careful what you wish my child he said softly Then he fell silent The story the boy prompted Oh yes Well once upon a time Paladine heard the prayer of a very great knight Huma Huma from the Canticle Yes thats the one Huma became lost in the forest He wandered and wandered until he despaired because he thought he would never see his homeland again He prayed to Paladine for help and there suddenly appeared before him a white stag Did Huma shoot it the boy asked He started to but his heart failed him He could not shoot an animal so magnificent The stag bounded away Then it stopped arid looked back at him as if waiting Huma began to follow it Day and night he followed the stag until it led him to his homeland He offered thanks to the god Paladine Blashphemy snarled a voice loudly A chair crashed back Tanis put down his mug of ale looking up Everyone at the table stopped drinking to watch the drunken Theocrat Blasphemy Hederick weaving unsteadily on his feet pointed at the old man Heretic Corrupting our youth Ill bring you before the counshel old man The Seeker fell back a step then staggered forward again He looked around the room with a pompous air Call the guardsh He made a grandiose gesture Have them arresht thish man and thish woman for singing lewd songsh Obviously a witch Ill confishcate thish staff The Seeker lurched across the floor to the barbarian woman who was staring at him in disgust He reached clumsily for her staff No the woman called Goldmoon spoke coolly That is mine You cannot take it Witch the Seeker sneered I am the High Theocrat I take what I want He started to make another grab for the staff The womans tall companion rose to his feet The Chieftains Daughter says you will not take it the man said harshly He shoved the Seeker backward The tall mans push was not rough but it knocked the drunken Theocrat completely off balance His arms flailing wildly he tried to catch himself He lurched forwardtoo fartripped over his official robes and fell head first into the roaring fire There was a whoosh and a flare of light then a sickening smell of burning flesh The Theocrats scream tore through the stunned silence as the crazed man leaped to his feet and started whirling around in a frenzy He had become a living torch Tanis and the others sat unable to move paralyzed with the shock of the incident Only Tasslehoff had wits enough to run forward anxious to try and help the man But the Theocrat was screaming and waving his arms fanning the flames that were consuming his clothes and his body There seemed no way that the little kender could help him Here The old man grabbed the barbarians featherdecorated staff and handed it to the kender Knock him down Then we can smother the fire Tasslehoff took the staff He swung it using all his strength and hit the Theocrat squarely in the chest The man fell to the ground There was a gasp from the crowd Tasslehoff himself stood openedmouthed the staff clutched in his hand staring down at the amazing sight at his feet The flames had died instantly The mans robes were whole undamaged His skin was pink and healthy He sat up a look of fear and awe on his face He stared down at his hands and his robes There was not a mark on his skin There was not the smallest cinder smoking on his robes It healed him the old man proclaimed loudly The staff Look at the staff Tasslehoff s eyes went to the staff in his hands It was made of blue crystal and was glowing with a bright blue light The old man began shouting Call the guards Arrest the kender Arrest the barbarians Arrest their friends I saw them come in with this knight He pointed at Sturm What Tanis leaped up Are you crazy old man Call the guards The word spread Did you see The blue crystal staff Weve found it Now theyll leave us alone Call the guards The Theocrat staggered to his feet his face pale blotched with red The barbarian woman and her companion stood up fear and alarm in their faces Foul witch Hedericks voice shook with rage You have cured me with evil Even as I burn to purify my flesh you will burn to purify your soul With that the Seeker reached out and before anyone could stop him he plunged his hand back into the flames He gagged with the pain but did not cry out Then clutching his charred and blackened hand he turned and staggered off through the murmuring crowd a wild look of satisfaction on his paintwisted face Youve got to get out of here Tika came running over to Tanis her breath coming in gasps The whole towns been hunting for that staff Those hooded men told the Theocrat theyd destroy Solace if they caught someone harboring the staff The townspeople will turn you over to the guards But its not our staff Tanis protested He glared at the old man and saw him settle back into his chair a pleased smile on his face The old man grinned at Tanis and winked Do you think theyll believe you Tika wrung her hands Look Tanis looked around People were glaring at them balefully Some took a firm grip on their mugs Others eased their hands onto the hilts of their swords Shouts from down below drew his eyes back to his friends The guards are coming exclaimed Tika Tanis rose Well have to go out through the kitchen Yes She nodded They wont look back there yet But hurry It wont take them long to surround the place Years of being apart had not affected the companions ability to react as a team to threat of danger Caramon had pulled on his shining helm drawn his sword shouldered his pack and was helping his brother to his feet Raistlin his staff in his hand was moving around the table Flint had hold of hisbattleaxe and was frowning darkly at the onlookers who seemed hesitant about rushing to attack such wellarmed men Only Sturm sat calmly drinking his ale Sturm Tanis said urgently Come on Weve got to get out of here Run The knight appeared astonished From this rabble Yes Tanis paused the knights code of honor forbade running from danger He had to convince him That man is a religious fanatic Sturm Hell probably burn us at the stake Anda sudden thought rescued himthere is a lady to protect The lady of course Sturm stood up at once and walked over to the woman Madam your servant He bowed the courtly knight would not be hurried It seems we are all in this together Your staff has placed us in considerable dangeryou most of all We are familiar with the area around here we grew up here You I know are strangers We would be honored to accompany you and your gallant friend and guard your lives Come on Tika urged tugging on Taniss arm Caramon and Raistlin were already at the kitchen door Get the kender Tanis told her Tasslehoff stood rooted to the floor staring at the staff It was rapidly fading back to its nondescript brown color Tika grabbed Tas by his topknot and pulled him toward the kitchen The kender shrieked dropping the staff Goldmoon swiftly picked it up clutching it close to her Although frightened her eyes were clear and steady as she looked at Sturm and Tanis she was apparently thinking rapidly Her companion said a harsh word in their language She shook her head He frowned and made a slashing motion with his hand She snapped a quick reply and he fell silent his face dark We will go with you Goldmoon said to Sturm in the Common tongue Thank you for the offer This way Tanis herded them out through the swinging kitchen doors following Tika and Tas He glanced behind him and saw some of the crowd move forward but in no great hurry The cook stared at them as they ran through the kitchen Caramon and Raistlin were already at the exit which was nothing more than a hole cut in the floor A rope hung from a sturdy limb above the hole and dropped forty feet to the ground Ah exclaimed Tas laughing Here the ale comes up and the garbage goes down He swung out onto the rope and shinnied down easily Im sorry about this Tika apologized to Goldmoon but it is the only way out of here I can climb down a rope Then the woman smiled and added Though I admit it has been many years She handed her staff to her companion and grasped the stout rope She began to descend moving skillfully hand over hand When she had reached the bottom her companion tossed the staff down swung on the rope and dropped through the hole How are you going to get down Raist Caramon asked his face lined with concern I can carry you on my back Raistlins eyes flashed with an anger that startled Tanis I can get down myself the mage hissed Before anyone could stop him he stepped to the edge of the hole and leaped out into the air Everyone gasped and peered down expecting to see Raistlin splattered all over the ground Instead they saw the young mage gently floating down his robes fluttering around him The crystal on his staff glowed brightly He shivers my skin Flint growled to Tanis Hurry Tanis shoved the dwarf forward Flint grabbed hold of the rope Caramon followed the big mans weight causing the limb the rope was tied around to creak I will go last Sturm said his sword drawn Very well Tanis knew it was useless to argue He slung the longbow and quiver of arrows over his shoulder grabbed the rope and started down Suddenly his hands slipped He slid down the rope unable to stop it tearing the skin off his palms He landed on the ground and looked wincing at his hands His palms were raw and bleeding But there was no time to think about them Glancing up he watched as Sturm descended Tikas face appeared in the opening Go to my house she mouthed pointing through the trees Then she was gone I know the way Tasslehoff said his eyes glowing with excitement Follow me They hurried off after the kender hearing the sounds of the guards climbing the stairway into the Inn Tanis unused to walking on the ground in Solace was soon lost Above him he could see the bridgewalks the street lamps gleaming among the tree leaves He was completely disoriented but Tas kept pushing forward confidently weaving in and out among the huge trunks of the vallenwood trees The sounds of the commotion at the Inn faded Well hide at Tikas for the night Tanis whispered to Sturm as they plunged through the underbrush Just in case someone recognized us and decides to search our homes Everyone will have forgotten about this by morning Well take the Plainsmen to my house and let them rest a few days Then we can send the barbarians on to Haven where the Council of High Seekers can talk with them I think I might even go along Im curious about this staff Sturm nodded Then he looked at Tanis and smiled his rare melancholy smile Welcome home the knight said Same to you The halfelf grinned They both came to a sudden halt bumping into Caramon in the dark Were here I think Caramon said In the light of the street lamps that hung in the tree limbs they could see Tasslehoff climbing tree branches like a gully dwarf The rest followed more slowly Caramon assisting his brother Tanis gritting his teeth from the pain in his hands climbed up slowly through the rapidly thinning autumn foliage Tas pulled himself up over the porch railing with the skill of a burglar The kender slipped over to the door and peered up and down the bridgewalk Seeing no one on it he motioned to the others Then he studied the lock and smiled to himself in satisfaction The kender slid something out of one of his pouches Within seconds the door of Tikas house swung open Come in he said playing host They crowded inside the little house the tall barbarian being forced to duck his head to avoid hitting the ceiling Tas pulled the curtains shut Sturm found a chair for the lady and the tall barbarian went to stand behind her Raistlin stirred up the fire Keep watch Tanis said Caramon nodded The warrior had already posted himself at a window staring out into the darkness The light from a street lamp gleamed through the curtains into the room casting dark shadows on the walls For long moments no one spoke each staring at the others Tanis sat down His eyes turned to the woman The blue crystal staff he said quietly It healed that man How I do not know She faltered II havent had it very long Tanis looked down at his hands They were bleeding from where the rope had peeled off his skin He held them out to her Slowly her face pale the woman touched him with the staff It began to glow blue Tanis felt a slight shock tingle through his body Even as he watched the blood on his palms vanished the skin became smooth and unscarred the pain eased and soon left him completely True healing he said in awe The open door Flight into darkness Raistlin sat down on the hearth rubbing his thin hands in the warmth of the small fire His golden eyes seemed brighter than the flames as he stared intently at the blue crystal staff resting across the womans lap What do you think asked Tanis If shes a charlatan shes a good one Raistlin commented thoughtfully Worm You dare to call the Chieftains Daughter charlatan The tall barbarian stepped toward Raistlin his dark brows contracted in a vicious scowl Caramon made a low rumbling sound in his throat and moved from the window to stand behind his brother Riverwind The woman laid her hand on the mans arm as he drew near her chair Please He meant no harm It is right that they do not trust us They do not know us And we do not know them the man growled If I might examine it Raistlin said Goldmoon nodded and held out the staff The mage stretched out his long bony arm his thin hands grasping for it eagerly As Raistlin touched the staff however there was a bright flash of blue light and a crackling sound The mage jerked his hand back crying out in pain and shock Caramon jumped forward but his brother stopped him No Caramon Raistlin whispered hoarsely wringing his injured hand The lady had nothing to do with that The woman indeed was staring at the staff in amazement What is it then Tanis asked in exasperation A staff that heals and injures at the same time It merely knows its own Raistlin licked his lips his eyes glittering Watch Caramon take the staff Not me The warrior drew back as if from a snake Take the staff Raistlin demanded Reluctantly Caramon stretched out a trembling hand His arm twitched as his fingers came closer and closer Closing his eyes and gritting his teeth in anticipation of pain he touched the staff Nothing happened Caramon opened his eyes wide startled He gripped the staff lifted it in his huge hand and grinned See there Raistlin gestured like an illusionist showing off a trick to the crowd Only those of simple goodness pure in hearthis sarcasm was bitingmay touch the staff It is truly a sacred staff of healing blessed by some god It is not magic No magic objects that I have ever heard about have healing powers Hush ordered Tasslehoff who had taken Caramons place by the window The Theocrats guards he warned softly No one spoke Now they could all hear goblin footsteps flapping on the bridgewalks that ran among the branches of the vallenwood trees Theyre conducting a housetohouse search Tanis whispered increduously listening to fists banging on a neighboring door The Seekers demand right of entry croaked a voice There was a pause then the same voice said No one home do we kick the door in Naw said another voice We better just report to the Theocrat let him kick the door down Now if it was unlocked thatd be different were allowed to enter then Tanis looked at the door opposite him He felt the hair rise on the back of his neck He could have sworn they had shut and bolted the door now it stood slightly open The door he whispered Caramon But the warrior had already moved over to stand behind the door his back to the wall his giant hands flexing The footsteps flapped to a stop outside The Seekers demand right of entry The goblins began to bang on the door then stopped in surprise as it swung open This place is empty said one Lets move on You got no imagination Grum said the other Heres our chance to pick up a few pieces of silver A goblin head appeared around the open door Its eyes focused on Raistlin sitting calmly his staff on his shoulder The goblin grunted in alarm then began to laugh Oh ho Look what weve found A staff The goblins eyes gleamed It took a step toward Raistlin its partner crowding close behind Hand me that staff Certainly the mage whispered He held his own staff forth Shirak he said The crystal ball flared into light The goblins shrieked and shut their eyes fumbling for their swords At that moment Caramon jumped from behind the door grabbed the goblins around their necks and swept their heads together with a sickening thud The goblin bodies crumpled into a stinking heap Dead asked Tanis as Caramon bent over them examining them by the light of Raistlins staff Im afraid so The big man sighed I hit them too hard Well thats torn it Tanis said grimly Weve murdered two more of the Theocrats guards Hell have the town up in arms Now we cant just lie low for a few daysweve got to get out of here And you twohe turned to the barbarianshad better come with us Wherever were going muttered Flint irritably Where were you headed Tanis asked Riverwind We were traveling to Haven the barbarian answered reluctantly There are wise men there Goldmoon said We hoped they could tell us about this staff You see the song I sangit was true the staff saved our lives Youll have to tell us later Tanis interrupted When these guards dont report back every goblin in Solace will be swarming up the trees Raistlin put out that light The mage spoke another word Dumak The crystal glimmered then the light died Whatll we do with the bodies Caramon asked nudging a dead goblin with his booted foot And what about Tika Wont she get into trouble Leave the bodies Taniss mind was working quickly And hack up the door Sturm knock over a few tables Well make it look as if we broke in here and got into a fight with these fellows That way Tika shouldnt be in too much trouble Shes a smart girlshell manage Well need food Tasslehoff stated He ran into the kitchen and began rummaging through the shelves stuffing loaves of bread and anything else that looked edible into his pouches He tossed Flint a full skin of wine Sturm overturned a few chairs Caramon arranged the bodies to make it look as if they had died in a ferocious battle The Plainsmen stood in front of the dying fire looking at Tanis uncertainly Well said Sturm Now what Where are we going Tanis hesitated running over the options in his mind The Plainsmen had come from the east andif their story was true and their tribe had been trying to kill themthey wouldnt want to go back that way The group could travel south into the elven kingdom but Tanis felt a strange reluctance to go back to his homelands He knew too that the elves would not be pleased to see these strangers enter in their hidden city We will travel north he said finally We will escort these two until we come to the crossroads then we can decide what to do from there They can go on southwest to Haven if they wish I plan to travel farther north and see if the rumors about armies gathering are true And perhaps run into Kitiara Raistlin whispered slyly Tanis flushed Is that plan all right he asked looking around Though not the eldest among us Tanis you are the wisest Sturm said We follow youas always Caramon nodded Raistlin was already heading for the door Flint shouldered the wine skin grumbling Tanis felt a gentle hand touch his arm He turned and looked down into the clear blue eyes of the beautiful barbarian We are grateful Goldmoon said slowly as if unused to expressing appreciation You risk your lives for us and we are strangers Tanis smiled and clasped her hand I am Tanis The brothers are Caramon and Raistlin The knight is Sturm Brightblade Flint Fireforge carries the wine and Tasslehoff Burrfoot is our clever locksmith You are Goldmoon and he is Riverwind Therewe are strangers no longer Goldmoon smiled wearily She patted Taniss arm then started out the door leaning on the staff that once again seemed plain and nondescript Tanis watched her then glanced up to see Riverwind staring at him the barbarians dark face an impenetrable mask Well Tanis amended silently Some of us are no longer strangers Soon everyone had gone Tas leading the way Tanis stood alone for a moment in the wrecked living room staring at the bodies of the goblins This was supposed to have been a peaceful homecoming after bitter years of solitary travel He thought of his comfortable house He thought of all the things he had planned to dothings he had planned to do together with Kitiara He thought of long winter nights with storytelling around the fire at the Inn then returning home laughing together beneath the fur blankets sleeping through the snowcovered mornings Tanis kicked at the smoldering coals scattering them Kitiara had not come back Goblins had invaded his quiet town He was fleeing into the night to escape a bunch of religious fanatics with every likelihood he could never return Elves do not notice the passage of time They live for hundreds of years For them the seasons pass like brief rain showers But Tanis was half human He sensed change coming felt the disquieting restlessness men feel before a thunderstorm He sighed and shook his head Then he went out the shattered door leaving it swinging crazily on one hinge Farewell to Flint Arrows fly Message in the stars Tanis swung over the porch and dropped down through the tree limbs to the ground below The others waited huddled in the darkness keeping out of the light cast by street lamps swinging in the branches above them A chill wind had sprung up blowing out of the north Tanis glanced behind him and saw other lights lights of the search parties He pulled his hood over his head and hurried forward Winds switched he said Therell be rain by morning He looked around at the small group seeing them in the eerie wildly dancing light of the windtossed lamps Goldmoons face was scarred with weariness Riverwinds was a stoic mask of strength but his shoulders sagged Raistlin shivering leaned against a tree wheezing for breath Tanis hunched his shoulders against the wind Weve got to find shelter he said Some place to rest Tanis Tas tugged on the halfelfs cloak We could go by boat Crystalmir Lakes only a short way Therere caves on the other side and it will cut walking time tomorrow Thats a good idea Tas but we dont have a boat No problem The kender grinned His small face and sharply pointed ears made him look particularly impish in the eerie light Tas is enjoying all of this immensely Tanis realized He felt like shaking the kender lecturing him sternly on how much danger they were in But the halfelf knew it was useless kenders are totally immune to fear The boats a good idea Tanis repeated after a moments thought You guide And dont tell Flint he added Ill take care of that Right Tas giggled then slipped back to the others Follow me he called out softly and he started off once more Flint grumbling into his beard stumped after the kender Goldmoon followed the dwarf Riverwind cast a quick penetrating glance around at everyone in the group then fell into step behind her I dont think he trusts us Caramon observed Would you Tanis asked glancing at the big man Caramons dragon helm glinted in the flickering lights his ringmail armor was visible whenever the wind blew his cape back A longsword clanked against his thick thighs a short bow and a quiver of arrows were slung over his shoulder a dagger protruded from his belt His shield was battered and dented from many fights The giant was ready for anything Tanis looked over at Stunn who proudly wore the coat of arms of a knighthood that had fallen into disgrace three hundred years before Although Sturm was only four years older than Caramon the knights strict disciplined life hardships brought on by poverty and his melancholy search for his beloved father had aged the knight beyond his years Only twentynine he looked forty Tanis thought I dont think Id trust us either Whats the plan Sturm asked Were going by boat Tanis answered Oh ho Caramon chuckled Told Flint yet No Leave that to me Where are we getting the boat Sturm asked suspiciously Youll be happier not knowing the halfelf said The knight frowned His eyes followed the kender who was far ahead of them flitting from one shadow to another I dont like this Tanis First were murderers now were about to become thieves I dont consider myself a murderer Caramon snorted Goblins dont count Tanis saw the knight glare at Caramon I dont like any of this Sturm he said hastily hoping to avoid an argument But its a matter of necessity Look at the Plainsmenprides the only thing keeping them on their feet Look at Raistlin Their eyes went to the mage who was shuffling through the dry leaves keeping always in the shadows He leaned heavily upon his staff Occasionally a dry cough racked his frail body Caramons face darkened Tanis is right he said softly Raist cant take much more of this I must go to him Leaving the knight and the halfelf he hurried forward to catch up with the robed bent figure of his twin Let me help you Raist they heard Caramon whisper Raistlin shook his hooded head and flinched away from his brothers touch Caramon shrugged and dropped his arm But the big warrior stayed close to his frail brother ready to help him if necessary Why does he put up with that Tanis asked softly Family Ties of blood Sturm sounded wistful He seemed about to say more then his eyes went to Taniss elven face with its growth of human hair and he fell silent Tanis saw the look knew what the knight was thinking Family ties of bloodthey were things the orphaned halfelf wouldnt know about Come on Tanis said abruptly Were dropping behind They soon left the vallenwood trees of Solace and entered the pine forest surrounding Crystalmir Lake Tanis could faintly hear muffled shouts far behind them Theyve found the bodies he guessed Sturm nodded gloomily Suddenly Tasslehoff seemed to materialize out of the darkness right beneath the halfelfs nose The trail runs a little over a mile to the lake Tas said Ill meet you where it comes out He gestured vaguely then disappeared before Tanis could say a word The halfelf looked back at Solace There seemed to be more lights and they were moving in this direction The roads were probably already blocked Wheres the kender Flint grumbled as they plunged through the forest Tas is meeting us at the lake Tanis replied Lake Flints eyes grew wide in alarm What lake Theres only one lake around here Flint Tanis said trying hard not to smile at Sturm Come on We better keep going His elvensight showed him the broad red outline of Caramon and the slighter red shape of his brother disappearing into the thick woods ahead I thought we were just going to lie low in the woods for awhile Flint shoved his way past Sturm to complain to Tanis Were going by boat Tanis moved forward Nope Flint growled Im not getting in any boat That accident happened ten years ago Tanis said exasperated Look Ill make Caramon sit still Absolutely not the dwarf said flatly No boats I took a vow Tanis Sturms voice whispered behind him Lights Blast The halfelf stopped and turned He had to wait a moment before catching sight of lights glittering through the trees The search had spread beyond Solace He hurried to catch up with Caramon Raistlin and the Plainsmen Lights he called out in a piercing whisper Caramon looked back and swore Riverwind raised his hand in acknowledgement Im afraid were going to have to move faster Caramon Tanis began Well make it the big man said unperturbed He was supporting his brother now his arm around Raistlins thin body practically carrying him Raistlin coughed softly but he was moving Sturm caught up with Tanis As they forced their way through the brush they could hear Flint puffing along behind muttering angrily to himself He wont come Tanis Sturm said Flints been in mortal fear of boats ever since Caramon almost accidentally drowned him that time You werent there You didnt see him after we hauled him out Hell come Tanis said breathing hard He cant let us youngsters go off into danger without him Sturm shook his head unconvinced Tanis looked back again He saw no lights but he knew they were too deep in the forest now to see them Fewmaster Toede may not have impressed anybody with his brains but it wouldnt take much intelligence to figure out that the group might take to the water Tanis stopped abruptly to keep from bumping into someone What is it he whispered Were here Caramon answered Tanis breathed a sigh of relief as he stared out across the dark expanse of Crystalmir Lake The wind whipped the water into frothy whitecaps Wheres Tas He kept his voice low There I think Caramon pointed at a dark object floating close to shore Tanis could barely make out the warm red outline of the kender sitting in a large boat The stars gleamed with icy brightness in the blueblack sky The red moon Lunitari was rising like a bloody fingernail from the water Its partner in the night sky Solinari had already risen marking the lake with molten silver What wonderful targets were going to make Sturm said irritably Tanis could see Tasslehoff turning this way and that searching for them The halfelf reached down fumbling for a rock in the darkness Finding one he lobbed it into the water It splashed just a few yards ahead of the boat Tas reacting to Taniss signal propelled the boat to shore Youre going to put all of us in one boat Flint said in horror Youre mad halfelf Its a big boat Tanis said No I wont go If it were one of the legendary whitewinged boats of Tarsis I still wouldnt go Id rather take my chances with the Theocrat Tanis ignored the fuming dwarf and motioned to Sturm Get everyone loaded up Well be along in a moment Dont take too long Sturm warned Listen I can hear Tanis said grimly Go on What are those sounds Goldmoon asked the knight as he came up to her Goblin search parties Sturm answered Those whistles keep them in contact when theyre separated Theyre moving into the woods now Goldmoon nodded in understanding She spoke a few words to Riverwind in their own language apparently continuing a conversation Sturm had interrupted The big Plainsman frowned and gestured back toward the forest with his hand Hes trying to convince her to split with us Sturm realized Maybe hes got enough woodslore to hide from goblin search parties for days but I doubt it Riverwind guelando Goldmoon said sharply Sturm saw Riverwind scowl in anger Without a word he turned and stalked toward the boat Goldmoon sighed and looked after him deep sorrow in her face Can I do anything to help lady Sturm asked gently No she replied Then she said sadly as if to herself He rules my heart but I am his ruler Once when we were young we thought we could forget that But I have been Chieftains Daughter too long Why doesnt he trust us Sturm asked He has all the prejudices of our people Goldmoon replied The Plainsmen do not trust those who are not human She glanced back Tanis cannot hide his elven blood beneath a beard Then there are the dwarf the kender And what of you lady Sturm asked Why do you trust us Dont you have these same prejudices Goldmoon turned to face him He could see her eyes dark and shimmering as the lake behind her When I was a girl she said in her deep low voice I was a princess of my people I was a priestess They worshipped me as a goddess I believed in it I adored it Then something happened She fell silent her eyes filled with memories What was that Sturm prompted softly I fell in love with a shepherd Goldmoon answered looking at Riverwind She sighed and walked toward the boat Sturm watched Riverwind wade into the water to drag the boat closer to shore as Raistlin and Caramon reached the waters edge Raistlin clutched his robes around him shivering I cant get my feet wet he whispered hoarsely Caramon did not reply He simply put his huge arms around his brother lifted him as easily as he would have lifted a child and set Raistlin in the boat The mage huddled in the aft part of the boat not saying a word of thanks Ill hold her steady Caramon told Riverwind You get in Riverwind hesitated a moment then climbed quickly over the side Caramon helped Goldmoon into the boat Riverwind caught hold of her and steadied her as the boat rocked gently The Plainsmen moved to sit in the stern behind Tasslehoff Caramon turned to Sturm as the knight drew near Whats happening back there Flint says hell burn before hell get in a boatat least then hell die warm instead of wet and cold Ill go up and haul him down here Caramon said Youd only make things worse You were the one that nearly drowned him remember Let Tanis handle ithes the diplomat Caramon nodded Both men stood waiting in silence Sturm saw Goldmoon look at Riverwind in mute appeal but the Plainsman did not heed her glance Tasslehoff fidgeting on his seat started to call out a shrill question but a stern look from the knight silenced him Raistlin huddled in his robes trying to suppress an uncontrollable cough Im going up there Sturm said finally Those whistles are getting closer We dont dare take any more time But at that moment he saw Tanis shake hands with the dwarf and begin to run toward the boat alone Flint stayed where he was near the edge of the woods Sturm shook his head I told Tanis the dwarf wouldnt come Stubborn as a dwarf so the old saying goes Caramon grunted And that ones had one hundred and fortyeight years to grow stubborner The big man shook his head sadly Well well miss him thats for certain Hes saved my life more than once Let me go get him One punch on the jaw and he wont know whether hes in a boat or his own bed Tanis ran up panting and heard the last comment No Caramon he said Flint would never forgive us Dont worry about him Hes going back to the hills Get in the boat There are more lights coming this way We left a trail through the forest a blind gully dwarf could follow No sense all of us getting wet Caramon said holding the side of the boat You and Sturm get in Ill shove off Sturm was already over the side Tanis patted Caramon on the back then climbed in The warrior pushed the boat out into the lake He was up to his knees in water when they heard a call from the shore Hold it It was Flint running down from the trees a vague moving shape of blackness against the moonlit shoreline Hang on Im coming Stop Tanis cried Caramon Wait for Flint Look Sturm halfrose pointing Lights had appeared in the trees smoking torches held by goblin guards Goblins Flint Tanis yelled Behind you Run The dwarf never questioning put his head down and pumped for the shore one hand on his helm to keep it from flying off Ill cover him Tanis said unslinging his bow With his elvensight he was the only one who could see the goblins behind the torches Fitting an arrow to his bow Tanis stood as Caramon held the big boat steady Tanis fired at the outline of the lead goblin The arrow struck it in the chest and it pitched forward on its face The other goblins slowed slightly reaching for their own bows Tanis fitted another arrow to his bow as Flint reached the shoreline Wait Im coming the dwarf gasped and he plunged into the water and sank like a rock Grab him Sturm yelled Tas row back There he is See The bubbles Caramon was splashing frantically in the water hunting for the dwarf Tas tried to row back but the weight in the boat was too much for the kender Tanis fired again missed his mark and swore beneath his breath He reached for another arrow The goblins were swarming down the hillside Ive got him Caramon shouted pulling the dripping spluttering dwarf out by the collar of his leather tunic Quit struggling he told Flint whose arms were flailing out in all directions But the dwarf was in a complete state of panic A goblin arrow thunked into Caramons chain mail and stuck there like a scrawny feather That does it The warrior grunted in exasperation and with a great heave of his muscular arms he pitched the dwarf into the boat as it moved out away from him Flint caught hold of a seat and held on his lower half sticking out over the edge Sturm grabbed him by the belt and dragged him aboard as the boat rocked alarmingly Tanis nearly lost his balance and was forced to drop his bow and catch hold of the side to keep from being thrown into the water A goblin arrow stuck into the gunwale just barely missing Taniss hand Row back to Caramon Tas Tanis yelled I cant shouted the struggling kender One swipe of an outofcontrol oar nearly knocked Sturm overboard The knight yanked the kender from his seat He grabbed the oars and smoothly brought the boat around to where Caramon could get hold of the side Tanis helped the warrior climb in then yelled to Sturm Pull The knight pulled on the oars with all his strength leaning over backward as he thrust the oars deep into the water The boat shot away from shore accompanied by the howls of angry goblins More arrows whizzed around the boat as Caramon dripping wet plopped down next to Tanis Goblin target practice tonight Caramon muttered pulling the arrow from his mail shirt We show up beautifully against the water Tanis was fumbling for his dropped bow when he noticed Raistlin sitting up Take cover Tanis warned and Caramon started to reach for his brother but the mage scowling at both of them slipped his hand into a pouch on his belt His delicate fingers drew out a handful of something as an arrow struck the seat next to him Raistlin did not react Tanis started to pull the mage down then realized he was lost in the concentration necessary to a magicuser casting a spell Disturbing him now might have drastic consequences causing the mage to forget the spell or worseto miscast the spell Tanis gritted his teeth and watched Raistlin lifted his thin frail hand and allowed the spell component he had taken from his pouch to fall slowly from between his fingers onto the deck of the boat Sand Tanis realized Ast tasarak sinwalan krynawi Raistlin murmured and then moved his right hand slowly in an arc parallel to the shore Tanis looked back toward land One by one the goblins dropped their bows and toppled over as though Raistlin were touching each in turn The arrows ceased Goblins farther away howled in rage and ran forward But by that time Sturms powerful strokes had carried the boat out of range Good work little brother Caramon said heartily Raistlin blinked and seemed to return to the world then the mage sank forward Caramon caught him and held him for a moment Then Raistlin sat up and sucked in a deep breath which caused him to cough Ill be all right he whispered withdrawing from Caramon What did you do to them asked Tanis as he searched for enemy arrows to drop them overboard goblins occasionally poisoned the arrowtips I put them to sleep Raistlin hissed through teeth that clicked together with the cold And now I must rest He sank back against the side of the boat Tanis looked at the mage Raistlin had indeed gained in power and skill I wish I could trust him the halfelf thought The boat moved across the starfilled lake The only sounds to be heard were the soft rhythmic plashing of the oars in the water and Raistlins dry wracking cough Tasslehoff uncorked the wineskin which Flint had somehow retained on his wild dash and tried to get the chilled shivering dwarf to swallow a mouthful But Flint crouched at the bottom of the boat could only shudder and stare out across the water Goldmoon sank deeper into her fur cape She wore the soft doeskin breeches of her people with a fringed overskirt and belted tunic Her boots were made of soft leather Water had sloshed over the edge of the boat when Caramon had thrown Flint aboard The water made the doeskin cling to her and soon she was chilled and shivering Take my cape Riverwind said in their language starting to remove his bearskin cloak No She shook her head You have been suffering from the fever I never get sick you know that Butshe looked up at him and smiledyou may put your arm around me warrior The heat from our bodies will warm us both Is that a royal command Chieftains Daughter Riverwind whispered teasingly drawing her close to him It is she said leaning against his strong body with a sigh of contentment She looked up into the starry heavens then stiffened and caught her breath in alarm What is it Riverwind asked staring up The others in the boat although they had not understood the exchange heard Goldmoons gasp and saw her eyes transfixed by something in the night sky Caramon poked his brother and said Raist what is it I dont see anything Raistlin sat up cast back his hood then coughed When the spasm passed he searched the night sky Then he stiffened and his eyes widened Reaching out with his thin bony hand Raistlin clutched Taniss arm holding onto it tightly as the halfelf involuntarily tried to pull away from the mages skeletal grip Tanis Raistlin wheezed his breath nearly gone The constellations What Tanis was truly startled by the pallor of the mages metallic gold skin and the feverish luster of his strange eyes What about the constellations Gone rasped Raistlin and lapsed into a fit of coughing Caramon put his arm around him holding him close almost as if the big man were trying to hold his brothers frail body together Raistlin recovered wiped his mouth with his hand Tanis saw that his fingers were dark with blood Raistlin took a deep breath then spoke The constellation known as the Queen of Darkness and the one called Valiant Warrior Both gone She has come to Krynn Tanis and he has come to fight her All the evil rumors we have heard are true War death destruction His voice died in another fit of coughing Caramon held him Cmon Raist he said soothingly Dont get so worked up Its only a bunch of stars Only a bunch of stars Tanis repeated flatly Sturm began to row again pulling swiftly for the opposite bank Night in a cave Dissension Tanis decides A chill wind began to blow across the lake Storm clouds rolled across the sky from the north obliterating the gaping black holes left by the fallen stars The companions hunched down in the boat pulling their cloaks tighter around them as the rain spattered down Caramon joined Sturm at the oars The big warrior tried to talk to the knight but Sturm ignored him He rowed in grim silence occasionally muttering to himself in Solamnic Sturm Therebetween the great rocks to the left Tanis called out pointing Sturm and Caramon pulled hard The rain made sighting the landmark rocks difficult and for a moment it seemed that they had lost their way in the darkness Then the rocks suddenly loomed ahead Sturm and Caramon brought the boat around Tanis sprang out over the side and pulled it to shore Torrents of rain lashed down The companions climbed from the boat wet and chilled They had to lift the dwarf outFlint was stiff as a dead goblin from fear Riverwind and Caramon hid the boat in the thick underbrush Tanis led the rest up a rocky trail to a small opening in the cliff face Goldmoon looked at the opening dubiously It seemed to be no more than a large crack in the surface of the cliff Inside however the cave was large enough for all of them to stretch out comfortably Nice home Tasslehoff glanced around Not much in the way of furniture Tanis grinned at the kender It will do for the night I dont think even the dwarf will complain about this If he does well send him back to sleep in the boat Tas flashed his own smile back at the halfelf It was good to see the old Tanis back He had thought his friend unusually moody and indecisive not the strong leader he had remembered from earlier days Yet now that they were on the road the glint was back in the halfelfs eyes He had come out of his brooding shell and was taking charge slipping back into his accustomed role He needed this adventure to get his mind off his problems whatever those might be The kender who had never been able to understand Taniss inner turmoil was glad this adventure had come along Caramon carried his brother from the boat and laid him down as gently as he could on the soft warm sand that covered the floor of the cave while Riverwind started a fire The wet wood crackled and spit but soon caught fire The smoke curled up toward the ceiling and drifted out through a crack The Plainsman covered the caves entrance with brush and fallen tree branches hiding the light of the fire and effectively keeping out the rain He fits in well Tanis thought as he watched the barbarian work He could almost be one of us Sighing the halfelf turned his attention to Raistlin Kneeling down beside him he looked at the young mage with concern Raistlins pale face reflected in the flickering firelight reminded the halfelf of the time he and Flint and Caramon had barely rescued Raistlin from a vicious mob intent on burning the mage at the stake Raistlin had attempted to expose a charlatan cleric who was bilking the villagers out of their money Instead of turning on the cleric the villagers had turned on Raistlin As Tanis had told Flintpeople wanted to believe in something Caramon busied himself around his brother placing his own heavy cloak over his shoulders Raistlins body was wracked by coughing spasms and blood trickled from his mouth His eyes gleamed feverishly Goldmoon knelt beside him a cup of wine in her hand Can you drink this she asked him gently Raistlin shook his head tried to speak coughed and pushed her hand away Goldmoon looked up at Tanis Perhapsmy staff she asked No Raistlin choked He motioned for Tanis to come near him Even sitting next to him Tanis could barely hear the mages words his broken sentences were interrupted by great gasps for air and fits of coughing The staff will not heal me Tanis he whispered Do not waste it on me If it is a blessed artifact its sacred power is limited My body was my sacrifice for my magic This damage is permanent Nothing can help His voice died his eyes closed The fire suddenly flared as wind whirled around the cavern Tanis looked up to see Sturm pulling the brush aside and entering the cave halfcarrying Flint who stumbled along on unsteady feet Sturm dumped him down beside the fire Both were soaking wet Sturm was clearly out of patience with the dwarf and as Tanis noted with the entire group Tanis watched him with concern recognizing the signs of a dark depression that sometimes overwhelmed the knight Sturm liked the orderly the welldisciplined The disappearance of the starsthe disturbance of the natural order of thingshad shaken him badly Tasslehoff wrapped a blanket around the dwarf who sat huddled on the cave floor his teeth chattering in his head so that his helm rattled Bbbboat was all he could say Tas poured him a cup of wine which the dwarf drank greedily Sturm looked at Flint in disgust Ill take the first watch he said and moved toward the mouth of the cave Riverwind rose to his feet I will watch with you he said harshly Sturm froze then turned slowly to face the tall Plainsman Tanis could see the knights face etched in sharp relief by the firelight dark lines carved around the stern mouth Although shorter in stature than Riverwind the knights air of nobility and the rigidity of his stance made the two appear almost equal I am a Knight of Solamnia Sturm said My word is my honor and my honor is my life I gave my word back in the Inn that I would protect you and your lady If you choose to dispute my word you dispute my honor and therefore you insult me I cannot allow that insult to remain between us Sturm Tanis was on his feet Never taking his eyes from the Plainsman the knight raised his hand Dont interfere Tanis Sturm said Well what will it beswords knives How do you barbarians fight Riverwinds stoic expression did not change He regarded the knight with intense dark eyes Then he spoke choosing his words carefully I did not mean to question your honor I do not know men and their cities and I tell you plainlyI am afraid It is my fear that makes me speak thus I have been afraid ever since the blue crystal staff was given to me Most of all I am afraid for Goldmoon The Plainsman looked over at the woman his eyes reflecting the glowing fire Without her I die How could I trust His voice failed The stoic mask cracked and crumbled from pain and weariness His knees buckled and he pitched forward Sturm caught him You couldnt the knight said I understand You are tired and you have been sick He helped Tanis lay the Plainsman at the back of the cave Rest now I will stand watch The knight shoved aside the brush and without saying another word stepped outside into the rain Goldmoon had listened to the altercation in silence Now she moved their meagre possessions to the back of the cave and knelt down by Riverwinds side He put his arm around her and held her close burying his face in her silvergold hair The two settled in the shadows of the cave Wrapped in Riverwinds fur cape they were soon asleep Goldmoons head resting on her warriors chest Tanis breathed a sigh of relief and turned back to Raistlin The mage had fallen into a fitful sleep Sometimes he murmured strange words in the language of magic his hand reaching out to touch his staff Tanis glanced around at the others Tasslehoff was sitting near the fire sorting through his acquired objects He sat crosslegged the treasures on the cave floor in front of him Tanis could make out glittering rings a few unusual coins a feather from the goatsucker bird pieces of twine a bead necklace a soap doll and a whistle One of the rings looked familiar It was a ring of elven make given Tanis a long time ago by someone he kept on the borders of his mind It was a finely carved delicate ring of golden clinging ivy leaves Tanis crept over to the kender walking softly to keep from waking the others Tas He tapped the kender on the shoulder and pointed My ring Is it asked Tasslehoff with wideeyed innocence Is this yours Im glad I found it You must have dropped it at the Inn Tanis took the ring with a wry smile then settled down next to the kender Have you got a map of this area Tas The kenders eyes shone A map Yes Tanis Of course He swept up all his valuables dumped them back into a pouch and pulled a handcarved wooden scroll case from another pouch He drew forth a sheaf of maps Tanis had seen the kenders collection before but it never failed to astonish him There must have been a hundred drawn on everything from fine parchment to soft kid leather to a huge palmetto leaf I thought you knew every tree personally around these parts Tanis Tasslehoff sorted through his maps his eyes occasionally lingering on a favorite The halfelf shook his head Ive lived here many years he said But lets face it I dont know any of the dark and secret paths You wont find many to Haven Tas pulled a map from his pile and smoothed it out on the cave floor The Haven Road through Solace Vale is quickest thats for certain Tanis studied the map by the light of the dying campfire Youre right he said The road is not only quickest it seems to be the only passable route for several miles ahead Both south and north of us lie the Kharolis Mountainsno passes there Frowning Tanis rolled up the map and handed it back Which is exactly what the Theocrat will figure Tasslehoff yawned Well he said putting the map back carefully into the case its a problem that will be solved by wiser heads than mine Im along for the fun Tucking the case back into a pouch the kender lay down on the cave floor drew his legs up beneath his chin and was soon sleeping the peaceful sleep of small children and animals Tanis looked at him with envy Although aching with weariness he couldnt relax enough for sleep Most of the others had dropped off all but the warrior watching over his brother Tanis walked over to Caramon Turn in he whispered Ill watch Raistlin No the big warrior said Reaching out he gently pulled a cloak up closer around his brothers shoulders He might need me But youve got to get some sleep I will Caramon grinned Go get some sleep yourself nursemaid Your children are fine Lookeven the dwarf is out cold I dont have to look Tanis said The Theocrat can probably hear him snoring in Solace Well my friend this reunion was not much like we planned five years ago What is Caramon asked softly glancing down at his brother Tanis patted the mans arm then lay down and rolled up in his own cloak and at last fell asleep The night passedslowly for those on watch swiftly for those asleep Caramon relieved Sturm Tanis relieved Caramon The storm continued unabated all night the wind whipping the lake into a whitecapped sea Lightning branched through the darkness like flaming trees Thunder rumbled continually The storm finally blew itself out by morning and the halfelf watched day dawn gray and chill The rain had ended but storm clouds still hung low No sun appeared in the sky Tanis felt a growing sense of urgency He could see no end to the storm clouds massing to the north Autumn storms were rare especially ones with this ferocity The wind was bitter too and it seemed odd that the storm came out of the north when they generally swept east across the Plains Sensitive to the ways of nature the strange weather upset Tanis nearly as much as Raistlins fallen stars He felt a need to get going even though it was early morning yet He went inside to wake the others The cave was chill and gloomy in the gray dawn despite the crackling fire Goldmoon and Tasslehoff were fixing breakfast Riverwind stood in the back of the cave shaking out Goldmoons fur cloak Tanis glanced at him The Plainsman had been about to say something to Goldmoon as Tanis entered but fell silent contenting himself with staring at her meaningfully as he continued his work Goldmoon kept her eyes lowered her face pale and troubled The barbarian regrets having let himself go last night Tanis realized There is not much food Im afraid Goldmoon said tossing cereal into a pot of boiling water Tikas larder wasnt well stocked Tasslehoff added in apology Weve got a loaf of bread some dried beef half a moldy cheese and the oatmeal Tika must eat her meals out Riverwind and I didnt bring any provisions Goldmoon said We really didnt expect to make this trip Tanis was about to ask her more about her song and the staff but the others started waking up as they smelled food Caramon yawned stretched and stood up Walking over to peer into the cookpot he groaned Oatmeal Is that all Therell be less for dinner Tasslehoff grinned Tighten your belt Youre gaining weight anyhow The big man sighed dismally The sparse breakfast was cheerless in the cold dawn Sturm refusing all offers of food went outside to keep watch Tanis could see the knight sitting on a rock staring gloomily at the dark clouds that trailed wispy fingers along the still water of the lake Caramon ate his share of the food quickly gulped down his brothers portion and then appropriated Sturms when the knight walked out Then the big man sat watching wistfully while the rest finished You gonna eat that he asked pointing to Flints share of bread The dwarf scowled Tasslehoff seeing the warriors eyes roam over to his plate crammed his bread into his mouth nearly choking himself in the process At least it kept him quiet Tanis thought glad for the respite from the kenders shrill voice Tas had been teasing Flint unmercifully all morning calling him Seamaster and Shipmate asking him the price of fish and how much he would charge to ferry them back across the lake Flint finally threw a rock at him and Tanis sent Tas down to the lake to scrub out the pans The halfelf walked to the back of the cave How are you this morning Raistlin he asked Were going to have to be moving out soon I am much better the mage replied in his soft whispering voice He was drinking some herbal concoction of his own make Tanis could see small feathery green leaves floating in steaming water It gave off a bitter acrid odor and Raistlin grimaced as he swallowed it Tasslehoff came bounding back into the cave pots and tin plates clattering loudly Tanis gritted his teeth at the noise started to reprimand the kender then changed his mind It wouldnt do any good Flint seeing the tension on Taniss face grabbed the pots from the kender and began packing them away Be serious the dwarf hissed at Tasslehoff Or Ill take you by the topknot and tie you to a tree as a warning to all kenders Tas reached out and plucked something from the dwarfs beard Look the kender held it up gleefully Seaweed Flint roaring made a grab for the kender but Tas skipped out of his way agilely There was a rustling sound as Sturm shoved aside the brush covering the doorway His face was dark and brooding Stop this Sturm said glowering at Flint and Tas his moustaches quivering His dour gaze turned on Tanis I could hear these two clear down by the lake Theyll have every goblin in Krynn on us Weve got to get out of here Well which way are we headed An uneasy silence fell Everyone stopped what he was doing and looked at Tanis with the exception of Raistlin The mage was wiping his cup out with a white cloth cleaning it fastidiously He continued working eyes downcast as though totally uninterested Tanis sighed and scratched his beard The Theocrat in Solace is corrupt We know that now He is using the goblin scum to take control If he had the staff he would use it for his own profit Weve searched for a sign of the true gods for years It seems we may have found one I am not about to hand it over to that Solace fraud Tika said she believed the Highseekers in Haven were still interested in the truth They may be able to tell us about the staff where it came from what its powers are Tas give me the map The kender spilling the contents of several pouches onto the floor finally produced the parchment requested We are here on the west bank of Crystalmir Tanis continued North and south of us are branches of the Kharolis Mountains which form the boundaries of Solace Vale There are no known passes through either range except through Gateway Pass south of Solace Almost certainly held by the goblins muttered Sturm There are passes to the northeast Thats across the lake Flint said in horror YesTanis kept a straight faceacross the lake But those lead to the Plains and I dont believe you want to go that direction He glanced at Goldmoon and Riverwind The west road goes through the Sentinel Peaks and Shadow Canyon to Haven That seems to me the obvious direction to take Sturm frowned And if the Highseekers there are as bad as the one in Solace Then we continue south to Qualinesti Qualinesti Riverwind scowled The Elven Lands No Humans are forbidden to enter Besides the way is hidden A rasping hissing sound cut into the discussion Everyone turned to face Raistlin as he spoke There is a way His voice was soft and mocking his golden eyes glittered in the cold light of dawn The paths of Darken Wood They lead right to Qualinesti Darken Wood Caramon repeated in alarm No Tanis The warrior shook his head Ill fight the living any day of the weekbut not the dead The dead Tasslehoff asked eagerly Tell me Caramon Shut up Tas Sturm snapped Darken Wood is madness None who enter have ever returned You would have us take this prize there mage Hold Tanis spoke sharply Everyone fell silent Even Sturm quieted The knight looked at Taniss calm thoughtful face the almondshaped eyes that held the wisdom of his many years of wandering The knight had often tried to resolve within himself why he accepted Taniss leadership He was nothing more than a bastard halfelf after all He did not come of noble blood He wore no armor carried no shield with a proud emblem Yet Sturm followed him and loved him and respected him as he respected no other living man Life was a dark shroud to the Solamnic Knight He could not pretend to ever know or understand it except through the code of the knights he lived by Est Sularus oth Mithas My honor is life The code defined honor and was more complete and detailed and strict than any known on Krynn The code had held true for seven hundred years but Sturms secret fear was that someday in the final battle the code would have no answers He knew that if that day came Tanis would be at his side holding the crumbling world together For while Sturm followed the code Tanis lived it Taniss voice brought the knights thoughts back to the present I remind all of you that this staff is not our prize The staff rightfully belongs to Goldmoonif it belongs to anyone We have no more right to it than the Theocrat in Solace Tanis turned to Goldmoon What is your will lady Goldmoon stared from Tanis to Sturm then she looked at Riverwind You know my mind he said coldly Butyou are Chieftains Daughter He rose to his feet Ignoring her pleading gaze he stalked outside What did he mean Tanis asked He wants us to leave you take the staff to Haven Goldmoon answered her voice low He says you are adding to our danger We would be safer on our own Adding to your danger Flint exploded Why we wouldnt be here I wouldnt have nearly drowned againif it hadnt been forfor The dwarf began to sputter in his rage Tanis held up his hand Enough He scratched his beard You will be safer with us Will you accept our help I will Goldmoon answered gravely for a short distance at least Good Tanis said Tas you know your way through Solace Vale You are guide And remember were not on a picnic Yes Tanis the kender said subdued He gathered his many pouches hung them around his waist and over his shoulders Passing Goldmoon he knelt swiftly and patted her hand then he was out the cave entrance The rest hastily gathered their gear together and followed Its going to rain again Flint grumbled glancing up at the lowering clouds I should have stayed in Solace Muttering he walked off adjusting his battleaxe on his back Tanis waiting for Goldmoon and Riverwind smiled and shook his head At least some things never changed dwarves among them Riverwind took their packs from Goldmoon and slung them over his shoulder I have made certain the boat is wellhidden and secure he told Tanis The stoic mask was in place again this morning In case we need it A good idea Tanis said Thank If you will go ahead Riverwind motioned I will come behind and cover our tracks Tanis started to speak to thank the Plainsman But Riverwind had already turned his back and was beginning his work Walking up the path the halfelf shook his head Behind him he could hear Goldmoon speaking softly in her own language Riverwind repliedone harsh word Tanis heard Goldmoon sigh then all other words were lost in the sound of crackling brush as Riverwind obliterated all traces of their passing The story of the staff Strange clerics Eerie feelings The thick woods of Solace Vale were a green mass of vibrant life Beneath the dense roof of the vallenwoods flourished thistlebrush and greenwall The ground was crisscrossed with the bothersome tangleshoot vines These had to be trod on with great care or they would suddenly snake around an ankle trapping the helpless victim until he was devoured by one of the many predatory animals lurking in the Vale thus providing the tangleshoot with what it needed to liveblood It took over an hour of hacking and chopping through the brush to get to the Haven Road All of them were scratched torn and tired and the long stretch of smoothpacked dirt that carried travelers to Haven or beyond was a welcome sight It wasnt until they stopped just in sight of the road and rested that they realized there were no sounds A hush had fallen over the land as if every creature were holding its breath waiting Now that they had reached the road no one was particularly eager to step out of the shelter of the brush Do you think its safe Caramon asked peering through a hedge Safe or not its the way we have to go Tanis snapped unless you can fly or unless you want to go back into the forest It took us an hour to travel a few hundred yards We ought to reach the crossroads next week at that pace The big man flushed chagrined I didnt mean Im sorry Tanis sighed He too looked down the road The great vallenwoods formed a dark corridor in the gray light I dont like it any better than you do Do we separate or stay together Sturm interrupted what he considered idle chatter with cold practicality We stay together Tanis replied Then after a moment he added Still someone ought to scout I will Tanis Tas volunteered popping up out of the brush beneath Taniss elbow No one would ever suspect a kender traveling alone Tanis frowned Tas was rightno one would suspect him Kenders were all afflicted with wanderlust traveling throughout Krynn in search of adventure But Tas had the disconcerting habit of forgetting his mission and wandering off if something more interesting caught his attention Very well Tanis said finally But remember Tasslehoff Burrfoot keep your eyes open and your wits about you No roaming off the road and above allTanis fixed the kenders eye with his own sternlykeep your hands out of other peoples belongings Unless theyre bakers Caramon added Tas giggled pushed his way through the final few feet of brush and started off down the road his hoopak staff digging holes in the mud his pouches jouncing up and down as he walked They heard his voice lift in a kender trailsong Your one true loves a sailing ship That anchors at our pier We lift her sails we man her decks We scrub the portholes clear And yes our lighthouse shines for her And yes our shores are warm We steer her into harbor Any port in a storm The sailors stand upon the docks The sailors stand in line As thirsty as a dwarf for gold Or centaurs for cheap wine For all the sailors love her And flock to where shes moored Each man hoping that he might Go down all hands on board Tanis grinning allowed a few minutes to pass after hearing the last verse of Tass song before starting out Finally they stepped out on the road with as much fear as a troupe of unskilled actors facing a hostile audience It felt as if every eye on Krynn was on them The deep shade under the flamecolored leaves made it impossible to see anything in the woods even a few feet from the road Sturm walked ahead of the group alone in bitter silence Tanis knew that though the knight held his head proudly he was slogging through his own darkness Caramon and Raistlin followed Tanis kept his eyes on the mage concerned about his ability to keep up Raistlin had experienced some difficulty in getting through the brush but he was moving along well now He leaned on his staff with one hand holding open a book with the other Tanis at first wondered what the mage was studying then realized it was his spellbook It is the curse of the magi that they must constantly study and recommit their spells to memory every day The words of magic flame in the mind then flicker and die when the spell is cast Each spell burns up some of the magicians physical and mental energy until he is totally exhausted and must rest before he can use his magic again Flint stumped along on the other side of Caramon The two began to argue softly about the tenyearold boating accident Trying to catch a fish with your bare hands Flint grumbled his disgust Tanis came last walking next to the Plainsmen He turned his attention to Goldmoon Seeing her clearly in the flecked gray light beneath the trees he noticed lines around her eyes that made her appear older than her twentynine years Our lives have not been easy Goldmoon confided to him as they walked Riverwind and I have loved each other many years but it is the law of my people that a warrior who wants to marry his chieftains daughter must perform some great feat to prove himself worthy It was worse with us Riverwinds family was cast out of our tribe years ago for refusing to worship our ancestors His grandfather believed in ancient gods who had existed before the Cataclysm though he could find little evidence of them left on Krynn My father was determined I should not marry so far beneath my station He sent Riverwind on an impossible questto find some object with holy properties that would prove the existence of these ancient gods Of course my father didnt believe such an object existed He hoped Riverwind would meet his death or that I would come to love another She looked up at the tall warrior walking beside her and smiled But his face was hard his eyes staring far away Her smile faded Sighing she continued her story speaking softly more to herself than Tanis Riverwind was gone long years And my life was empty I sometimes thought my heart would die Then just a week ago he returned He was halfdead out of his mind with a raging fever He stumbled into camp and fell at my feet his skin burning to the touch In his hand he clutched this staff We had to pry his fingers loose Even unconscious he would not release it He raved in his fever about a dark place a broken city where death had black wings Then when he was nearly wild with fear and terror and the servants had to tie his arms to the bed he remembered a woman a woman dressed in blue light She came to him in the dark place he said and healed him and gave him the staff When he remembered her he grew calmer and his fever broke Two days ago She paused had it really been only two days It seemed a lifetime Sighing she continued He presented the staff to my father telling him it had been given to him by a goddess though he did not know her name My father looked at this staff Goldmoon held it upand commanded it to do something anything Nothing happened He threw it back to Riverwind proclaiming him a fraud and ordered the people to stone him to death as punishment for his blasphemy Goldmoons face grew pale as she spoke Riverwinds face dark and shadowed The tribe bound Riverwind and dragged him to the Grieving Wall she said barely speaking above a whisper They started hurling rocks He looked at me with so much love and he shouted that not even death would separate us I couldnt bear the thought of living my life alone without him I ran to him The rocks struck us Goldmoon put her hand to her forehead wincing in remembered pain and Taniss attention was drawn to a fresh jagged scar on her tanned skin There was a blinding flash of light When Riverwind and I could see again we were standing on the road outside of Solace The staff glowed blue then dimmed and faded until it is as you see it now It was then we determined to go to Haven and ask the wise men at the temple about the staff Riverwind Tanis asked troubled what do you remember of this broken city Where was it Riverwind didnt answer He glanced at Tanis out of the corner of his dark eyes and it was obvious his thoughts had been far away Then he stared off into the shadowy trees Tanis HalfElven he finally said That is your name Among humans that is what I am called Tanis answered My elvish name is long and difficult for humans to pronounce Riverwind frowned Why is it he asked that you are called halfelf and not halfman The question struck Tanis like a blow across the face He could almost envision himself sprawling in the dirt and had to force himself to stop and swallow an angry retort He knew Riverwind was asking this question for a reason It had not been meant as an insult This was a test Tanis realized He chose his words carefully According to humans half an elf is but part of a whole being Half a man is a cripple Riverwind considered this finally nodded once abruptly and answered Taniss question I wandered many long years he replied Often I had no idea where I was I followed the sun and the moons and the stars My last journey is like a dark dream He was silent for a moment When he spoke it was as if he were talking from some great distance It was a city once beautiful with white buildings supported by tall columns of marble But it is now as if some great hand had picked up the city and cast it down a mountainside The city is now very old and very evil Death on black wings Tanis said softly It rose like a god from the darkness its creatures worshipped it shrieking and howling The Plainsmans face paled beneath his sunbaked skin He was sweating in the chill morning air I can speak of it no more Goldmoon laid her hand on his arm and the tension in his face eased And out of the horror came a woman who gave you the staff Tanis pursued She healed me Riverwind said simply I was dying Tanis stared intently at the staff Goldmoon held in her hand It was just a plain ordinary staff that he never noticed until his attention was called to it A strange device was carved on the top and featherssuch as the barbarians admirewere tied around it Yet he had seen it glow blue He had felt its healing powers Was this a gift from ancient godscome to aid them in their time of need Or was it evil What did he know of these barbarians anyway Tanis thought about Raistlins claim that the staff could only be touched by those pure of heart He shook his head It sounded good He wanted to believe it Tanis lost in thought felt Goldmoon touch his arm He looked up to see Sturm and Caramon signaling The halfelf suddenly realized he and the Plainsmen had fallen far behind the others He broke into a run What is it Sturm pointed The scout returns he said dryly Tasslehoff was running down the road toward them He waved his arm three times Into the brush Tanis ordered The group hurriedly left the road and plunged into the bushes and scrub trees growing along the south edgeall except Sturm Come on Tanis put his hand on the knights arm Sturm pulled away from the halfelf I will not hide in a ditch the knight stated coldly Sturm Tanis began fighting to control his rising anger He choked back bitter words that would do no good and might cause irreparable harm Instead he turned from the knight his lips compressed and waited in grim silence for the kender Tas came dashing up pouches and packs bouncing wildly as he ran Clerics he gasped A party of clerics Eight Sturm sniffed I thought it was a battalion of goblin guards at the least I believe we can handle a party of clerics I dont know Tasslehoff said dubiously Ive seen clerics from every part of Krynn and Ive never seen any like these He glanced down the road apprehensively then gazed up at Tanis unusual seriousness in his brown eyes Do you remember what Tika said about the strange men in Solacehanging around with Hederick How they were hooded and dressed in heavy robes Well that describes these clerics exactly And Tanis they gave me an eerie feeling The kender shuddered Theyll be in sight in a few moments Tanis glanced at Sturm The knight raised his eyebrows Both of them knew that kenders did not feel the emotion of fear yet were extremely sensitive to other creatures natures Tanis couldnt remember when the sight of any being on Krynn had ever given Tas an eerie feelingand he had been with the kender in some tight spots Here they come Tanis said suddenly He and Sturm and Tas moved back into the shadows of the trees to the left watching as the clerics slowly rounded a bend in the road They were too far away for the halfelf to be able to tell much about them except that they were moving very slowly dragging a large handcart behind them Maybe you should talk to them Sturm Tanis said softly We need information about the road ahead But be careful my friend Ill be careful Sturm said smiling I have no intention of throwing my life away needlessly The knight gripped Taniss arm a moment in silent apology then dropped his hand to loosen his sword in its antique scabbard He walked across to the other side of the road and leaned up against a brokendown wooden fence head bowed as though resting Tanis stood a moment irresolute then turned and made his way through the brush Tasslehoff at his heels What is it Caramon grunted as Tanis and Tas appeared The big warrior shifted his girth causing his arsenal of weapons to clank loudly The rest of the companions were huddled together concealed behind thick clumps of brush yet able to get a clear view of the road Hush Tanis knelt down between Caramon and Riverwind who crouched in the brush a few feet to Taniss left Clerics he whispered A group of them coming down the road Sturms going to question them Clerics Caramon snorted derisively and settled back comfortably on his heels But Raistlin stirred restlessly Clerics he whispered thoughtfully I do not like this What do you mean asked Tanis Raistlin peered at the halfelf from the dark shadows of his hood All Tanis could see were the mages golden hourglass eyes narrow slits of cunning and intelligence Strange clerics Raistlin spoke with elaborate patience as one speaks to a child The staff has healing clerical powerssuch powers as have not been seen on Krynn since the Cataclysm Caramon and I saw some of these cloaked and hooded men in Solace Dont you find it odd my friend that these clerics and this staff turned up at the same time in the same place when neither has been seen before Perhaps this staff is truly theirsby right Tanis glanced at Goldmoon Her face was shadowed with worry Surely she must be wondering the same thing He looked back at the road again The cloaked figures were moving at a crawling pace pulling the cart Sturm sat on the fence stroking his moustaches The companions waited in silence Gray clouds massed overhead the sky grew darker and soon water began to drip through the branches of the trees Thereits raining Flint grumbled It isnt enough that I have to squat in a bush like a toad now I get soaked to the skin Tanis glared at the dwarf Flint mumbled and fell silent Soon the companions could hear nothing but the rain splatting against the already wet leaves drumming on shield and helm It was a cold steady rain the kind that seeps through the thickest cloak It ran off Caramons dragon helm and trickled down his neck Raistlin began to shiver and cough covering his mouth with his hand to muffle the sound as everyone stared at him in alarm Tanis looked out to the road Like Tas he had never seen anything to compare to these clerics in his hundred years of life on Krynn They were tall about six feet in height Long robes shrouded their bodies hooded cloaks covered the robes Even their feet and hands were wrapped in cloth like bandages covering leprous wounds As they neared Sturm they glanced around warily One of them stared straight into the brush where the companions were hiding They could see only dark glittering eyes through a swath of cloth Hail Knight of Solamnia the lead cleric said in the Common Tongue His voice was hollow lispingan inhuman voice Tanis shivered Greetings brethren Sturm answered also in Common I have traveled many miles this day and you are the first travelers I have passed I have heard strange rumors and I seek information about the road ahead Where do you come from We come from the east originally the cleric answered But today we travel from Haven It is a chill bitter day for journeying knight which is perhaps why you find the road empty We ourselves would not undertake such a journey save we are driven by necessity We did not pass you on the road so you must be traveling from Solace Sir Knight Sturm nodded Several of the clerics standing at the rear of the cart turned their hooded faces toward each other muttering The lead cleric spoke to them in a strange guttural language Tanis looked at his companions Tasslehoff shook his head as did the rest of them none of them had heard it before The cleric switched back to Common I am curious to hear these rumors you speak of knight There is talk of armies in the north Sturm replied I am traveling that way to my homeland of Solamnia I would not want to run into a war to which I had not been invited We have not heard these rumors the cleric answered So far as we know the road to the north is clear Ah thats what comes of listening to drunken companions Sturm shrugged But what is this necessity you speak of that drives the brethren out into such foul weather We seek a staff the cleric answered readily A blue crystal staff We heard that it had been sighted in Solace Do you know aught of it Yes Sturm answered I heard of such a staff in Solace I heard of the armies to the north from the same companions Am I to believe these stories or not This appeared to confound the cleric for a moment He glanced around as if uncertain how to react Tell me said Sturm lounging back against the fence why do you seek a blue crystal staff Surely one of plain sturdy wood would suit you reverend gentlemen better It is a sacred staff of healing the cleric replied gravely One of our brothers is sorely ill he will die without the blessed touch of this holy relic Healing Sturm raised his eyebrows A sacred staff of healing would be of great value How did you come to misplace such a rare and wonderful object We did not misplace it the cleric snarled Tanis saw the mans wrapped hands clench in anger It was stolen from our holy order We tracked the foul thief to a barbarian village in the Plains then lost his trail There are rumors of strange doings in Solace however and it is there we go He gestured to the back of the cart This dismal journey is but little sacrifice for us compared to the pain and agony our brother endures Im afraid I cannot help Sturm began I can help you called a clear voice from beside Tanis He reached out but he was too late Goldmoon had risen from the brush and was walking determinedly to the road pushing aside tree branches and brambles Riverwind jumped to his feet and crashed through the shrubbery after her Goldmoon Tanis risked a piercing whisper I must know was all she said The clerics hearing Goldmoons voice glanced at each other knowingly nodding their hooded heads Tanis sensed trouble but before he could say anything Caramon jumped to his feet The Plainsmen are not leaving me behind in a ditch while they have all the fun Caramon stated plunging through the thicket after Riverwind Has everyone gone mad Tanis growled He grabbed Tasslehoff by his shirt collar dragging the kender back as he was about to leap joyfully after Caramon Flint watch the kender Raistlin No need to worry about me Tanis the mage whispered I have no intention of going out there Right Well stay here Tanis rose to his feet and slowly started forward an eerie feeling creeping over him Search for truth Unexpected answers I can help you Goldmoons clear voice rang out like a pure silver bell The Chieftains Daughter saw Sturms shocked face she understood Tanis warning But this was not the act of a foolish hysterical woman Goldmoon was far from that She had ruled her tribe in all but name for ten years ever since sickness had struck her father like a lightning bolt leaving him unable to speak clearly or to move his right arm and leg She had led her people in times of war with neighboring tribes and in times of peace She had confounded attempts to wrest her power from her She knew that what she was doing now was dangerous These strange clerics filled her with loathing But they obviously knew something about this staff and she had to know the answer I am the bearer of the blue crystal staff Goldmoon said approaching the leader of the clerics her head held proudly But we did not steal it the staff was given to us Riverwind stepped to one side of her Sturm to the other Caramon came charging through the brush and stood behind her his hand on his sword hilt an eager grin on his face So you say the cleric said in a soft sneering voice He stared at the plain brown staff in her hand with avid black gleaming eyes then reached out his wrapped hand to take it Goldmoon swiftly clasped the staff to her body The staff was carried out of a place of great evil she said I will do what I can to help your dying brother but I will not relinquish this staff to you or to anyone else until I am firmly convinced of your rightful claim to it The cleric hesitated glanced back at his fellows Tanis saw them make nervous tentative gestures toward the wide cloth belts they wore tied around their flowing robes Unusually wide belts Tanis noticed with strange bulges beneath themnot he was sure made by prayer books He swore in frustration wishing Sturm and Caramon were paying attention But Sturm seemed completely relaxed and Caramon was nudging him as though sharing a private joke Tanis raised his bow cautiously and put an arrow to the string The cleric finally bowed his head in submission folding his hands in his sleeves We will be grateful for whatever aid you can give our poor brother he said his voice muffled And then I hope you and your companions will return with us to Haven I promise you that you will be convinced that the staff has come into your possession wrongly Well go where weve a mind to brother Caramon growled Fool Tanis thought The halfelf considered shouting a warning then decided to remain hidden in case his growing fears were realized Goldmoon and the leader of the cloaked men passed the cart Riverwind next to her Caramon and Sturm remained near the front of it watching with interest As Goldmoon and the cleric reached the back the cleric put out a wrapped hand and drew Goldmoon toward the cart She pulled away from his touch and stepped forward by herself The cleric bowed humbly then lifted up a cloth covering the back of the cart Holding the staff in front of her Goldmoon peered in Tanis saw a flurry of movement Goldmoon screamed There was a flash of blue light and a cry Goldmoon sprang backward as Riverwind jumped in front of her The cleric lifted a horn to his lips and blew long wailing notes Caramon Sturm Tanis called raising his bow Its a tra A great weight dropped on the halfelf from above knocking him to the ground Strong hands groped for his throat shoving his face deep into the wet leaves and mud The mans fingers found their hold and began squeezing Tanis fought to breathe but his nose and mouth were filled with mud Seeing starbursts he tore frantically at the hands that were trying to crush his windpipe The mans grip was incredibly strong Tanis felt himself losing consciousness He tensed his muscles for one final desperate struggle then he heard a hoarse cry and a bonecrushing thump The hands relaxed their grip and the heavy weight was dragged off him Tanis staggered to his knees his breath coming in painful gasps Wiping mud from his face he looked up to see Flint with a log in his hand But the dwarfs eyes were not on him They were on the body at his feet Tanis followed the astonished dwarfs gaze and the halfelf recoiled in horror It wasnt a man Leathery wings sprang from its back It had the scaly flesh of a reptile its large hands and feet were clawed but it walked upright in the manner of men The creature wore sophisticated armor that allowed it the use of its wings It was the creatures face however that made him shudderit was not the face of any living being he had ever seen before either on Krynn or in his darkest nightmares The creature had the face of a man but it was as if some malevolent being had twisted it into that of a reptile By all the gods Raistlin breathed creeping up to Tanis What is that Before Tanis could answer he saw out of the corner of his eye a brilliant flash of blue light and he heard Goldmoon calling For one instant as Goldmoon had looked into the cart she had wondered what terrible disease could turn a mans flesh into scales She had moved forward to touch the pitiful cleric with her staff but at that moment the creature sprang out at her grasping for the staff with a clawed hand Goldmoon stumbled backward but the creature was swift and its clawed hand closed around the staff There was a blinding flash of blue light The creature shrieked in pain and fell back wringing its blackened hand Riverwind sword drawn had leaped in front of his Chieftains Daughter But now she heard him gasp and she saw his sword arm drop weakly He staggered backward making no effort to defend himself Rough wrapped hands grabbed her from behind A horrible scaled hand was clapped over her mouth Struggling to free herself she caught a glimpse of Riverwind He was staring wideeyed in terror at the thing in the cart his face deathly white his breathing swift and shallowa man who wakes from a nightmare to discover it is reality Goldmoon strong child of a warrior race kicked backwards at the cleric holding her her foot aiming for his knee Her skillful kick caught her opponent offguard and crushed his kneecap The instant the cleric eased his grip on her Goldmoon whirled around and struck him with her staff She was amazed to see the cleric slump to the ground seemingly felled by a blow even the mighty Caramon might have envied She looked at her staff in astonishment the staff that now glowed a bright blue But there was no time to wonderother creatures surrounded her She swung her glistening staff in a wide arc holding them at bay But for how long Riverwind Goldmoons cry woke the Plainsman from his terror Turning he saw her backing into the forest keeping the cloaked clerics away with the staff He grabbed one of the clerics from behind and threw him heavily to the ground Another jumped at him while a third sprang toward Goldmoon There was a blinding blue flash A moment ahead of Taniss cry Sturm realized the clerics had set a trap and drew his sword He had seen through the slats of the old wooden cart a clawed hand grabbing for the staff Lunging forward he had gone to back up Riverwind But the knight was totally unprepared for the Plainsmans reaction at sight of the creature in the cart Sturm saw Riverwind stagger backwards helpless as the creature grabbed a battleaxe in its uninjured hand and sprang directly at the barbarian Riverwind made no move to defend himself He just stared his weapon dangling in his hand Sturm plunged his sword into the creatures back The thing screamed and whirled around to attack wrenching the sword from the knights hand Slavering and gurgling in its dying rage the creature wrapped its arms around the startled knight and bore him into the muddy road Sturm knew the thing that grasped him was dying and fought to beat down the terror and revulsion he felt at the touch of its slimy skin The screaming stopped and he felt the creature go rigid The knight shoved the body over and quickly started to pull his sword from the creatures back The weapon didnt budge He stared at it in disbelief then yanked on the sword with all his might even putting his booted foot against the body to gain leverage The weapon was stuck fast Furious he beat at the creature with his hands then drew back in fear and loathing The thing had turned to stone Caramon Sturm yelled as another of the strange clerics leaped toward him swinging an axe Sturm ducked felt a slashing pain and then was blinded when blood flowed into his eyes He stumbled unable to see and a crushing weight bore him to the ground Caramon standing near the front of the cart started to go to Goldmoons aid when he heard Sturms cry Then two of the creatures bore down on him Swinging his short sword to force them to keep their distance Caramon drew his dagger with his left hand One cleric jumped for him and Caramon slashed out his blade biting deep into flesh He smelled a foul rotting stench and saw a sickly green stain appear on the clerics robes but the wound appeared just to enrage the creature It kept coming saliva dripping from jaws that were the jaws of a reptilenot a man For a moment panic engulfed Caramon He had fought trolls and goblins but these horrible clerics completely unnerved him He felt lost and alone then he heard a reassuring whisper next to him I am here my brother Raistlins calm voice filled his mind About time Caramon gasped threatening the creature with his sword What sort of foul clerics are these Dont stab them Raistlin warned swiftly Theyll turn to stone Theyre not clerics They are some sort of reptile man That is the reason for the robes and hoods Though different as light and shadow the twins fought well as a team They exchanged few words during battletheir thoughts merging faster than tongues could translate Caramon dropped his sword and dagger and flexed his huge arm muscles The creatures seeing Caramon drop his weapons charged forward Their rags had fallen loose and fluttered about them grotesquely Caramon grimaced at the sight of the scaled bodies and clawed hands Ready he said to his brother Ast tasark simiralan krynawi said Raistlin softly and he threw a handful of sand into the air The creatures stopped their wild rush shook their heads groggily as magical sleep stole over them but then blinked their eyes Within moments they had regained their senses and started forward again Magic resistant Raistlin murmured in awe But that brief interlude of near sleep was long enough for Caramon Encircling their scrawny reptilian necks with his huge hands the warrior swept their heads together The bodies tumbled to the groundlifeless statues Caramon looked up to see two more clerics crawling over the stony bodies of their brethren curved swords gleaming in their wrapped hands Stand behind me ordered Raistlin in a hoarse whisper Caramon reached down and grabbed dagger and sword He dodged behind his brother fearful for his twins safety yet knowing Raistlin could not cast his spell if he stood in the way Raistlin stared intently at the creatures whorecognizing a magicuserslowed and glanced at each other hesitant to approach One dropped to the ground and crawled under the cart The other sprang forward sword in hand hoping to impale the mage before his spell was cast or at least break the concentration that was so necessary to the spellcaster Caramon bellowed Raistlin seemed not to hear or see any of them Slowly he raised his hands Placing his thumbs together he spread his thin fingers in a fanlike pattern and spoke Kair tangus miopiar Magic coursed through his frail body and the creature was engulfed in flame Tanis recovering from his initial shock heard Sturms yell and crashed through the brush out onto the road He swung the flat of his sword blade like a club and struck the creature that had Sturm pinned to the ground The cleric fell over with a shriek and Tanis was able to drag the wounded knight into the brush My sword Sturm mumbled dazed Blood poured down his face he tried unsuccessfully to wipe it away Well get it Tanis promised wondering how Looking down the road he could see more creatures swarming out of the woods and heading toward them Taniss mouth was dry Weve got to get out of here he thought fighting down panic He forced himself to pause and draw a deep breath Then he turned to Flint and Tasslehoff who had run up behind him Stay here and guard Sturm he instructed Im going to get everyone together Well head back into the woods Not waiting for an answer Tanis dashed out into the road but then the flames from Raistlins spell flared out and he was forced to fling himself to the ground The cart began to smoke as the straw pallet the creature had been lying on inside caught fire Stay here and guard Sturm Humpf Flint muttered getting a firm grip on his battleaxe For the moment the creatures coming down the road did not seem to notice the dwarf or the kender or the wounded knight lying in the shadows of the trees Their attention was on the two small knots of battling warriors But Flint knew it was only a matter of time He planted his feet more firmly Do something for Sturm he said to Tas irritably Make yourself useful for once Im trying Tasslehoff replied in a hurt tone But I cant get he bleeding stopped He wiped the knights eyes with a moderately clean handkerchief There can you see now he asked anxiously Sturm groaned and tried to sit up but pain flashed through his head and he sank back My sword he said Tasslehoff looked over to see Sturms twohanded weapon sticking out of the back of the stone cleric Thats fantastic the wideeyed kender said Look Flint Sturms sword I know you fogbrained idiot Render Flint roared as he saw a creature running toward them its blade drawn Ill just go get it Tas said cheerfully to Sturm as he knelt beside him I wont be a moment No Flint yelled realizing the attacking cleric was out of Tass line of vision The creatures wicked curved sword lashed out in a flashing arc aimed for the dwarfs neck Flint swung his axe but at that moment Tasslehoffhis eyes on Sturms swordrose to his feet The kenders hoopak staff struck the dwarf in the back of the knees causing Flints legs to buckle beneath him The creatures sword whistled harmlessly overhead as the dwarf gave a startled yell and fell over backwards on top of Sturm Tasslehoff hearing the dwarf shout looked back astonished at an odd sight a cleric was attacking Flint and for some reason the dwarf was lying on his back legs flailing when he should have been up fighting What are you doing Flint Tas shouted He nonchalantly struck the creature in the midsection with his hoopak struck it again on the head as it toppled forward and watched it fall to the ground unconscious There he said irritably to Flint Do I have to fight your battles for you The kender turned and headed back toward Sturms sword Fight For me The dwarf sputtering with rage struggled wildly to stand up His helm had slipped over his eyes blinding him Flint shoved it back just as another cleric bowled into him knocking the dwarf off his feet again Tanis found Goldmoon and Riverwind standing back to back Goldmoon fending off the creatures with her staff Three of them lay dead at her feet their stony remains blackened from the staffs blue flame Riverwinds sword was caught fast in the guts of another statue The Plainsman had unslung his only remaining weaponhis short bowand had an arrow nocked and ready The creatures were for the moment hanging back discussing their strategy in low indecipherable tones Knowing they must rush the Plainsmen in a moment Tanis leaped toward them and smote one of the creatures from behind using the flat of his sword then made a backhand swing at another Come on he shouted to the Plainsmen This way Some of the creatures turned at this new attack others hesitated Riverwind fired an arrow and felled one then he grabbed Goldmoons hand and together they ran toward Tanis jumping over the stone bodies of their victims Tanis let them get past him fending off the creatures with the flat of his sword Here take this dagger he shouted to Riverwind as the barbarian ran by Riverwind grabbed it reversed it and struck one of the creatures in the jaw Jabbing upward with the hilt he broke its neck There was another flash of blue flame as Goldmoon used her staff to knock another creature out of the way Then they were into the woods The wooden cart was burning fiercely now Peering through the smoke Tanis caught glimpses of the road A shiver ran through him as he saw dark winged forms floating to the ground about a half mile away on either side of them The road was cut off in both directions They were trapped unless they escaped into the woods immediately He reached the place where he had left Sturm Goldmoon and Riverwind were there so was Flint Where was everyone else He stared around in the thick smoke blinking back tears Help Sturm he told Goldmoon Then he turned to Flint who was trying unsuccessfully to yank his axe out of the chest of a stone creature Where are Caramon and Raistlin And wheres Tas I told him to stay here Blasted kender nearly got me killed Flint exploded I hope they carry him off I hope they use him for dog meat I hope In the name of the gods Tanis swore in exasperation He made his way through the smoke toward where he had last seen Caramon and Raistlin and stumbled across the kender dragging Sturms sword back along the road The weapon was nearly as big as Tasslehoff and he couldnt lift it so he was dragging it through the mud How did you get that Tanis asked in amazement coughing in the thick smoke that boiled around them Tas grinned tears streaming down his face from the smoke in his eyes The creature turned to dust he said happily Oh Tanis it was wonderful I walked up and pulled on the sword and it wouldnt come out so I pulled again and Not now Get back to the others Tanis grabbed the kender and shoved him forward Have you seen Caramon and Raistlin But just then he heard the warriors voice boom out of the smoke Here we are Caramon panted He had his arm around his brother who was coughing uncontrollably Have we destroyed them all the big man asked cheerfully No we havent Tanis replied grimly In fact weve got to get away through the woods to the south He put his arm around Raistlin and together they hurried back to where the others were huddled by the road choking in the smoke yet thankful for its enveloping cover Sturm was on his feet his face pale but the pain in his head was gone and the wound had quit bleeding The staff healed him Tanis asked Goldmoon She coughed Not completely Enough so that he can walk It has limits Raistlin said wheezing Yes Tanis interrupted Well were heading south into the woods Caramon shook his head Thats Darken Wood he began I knowyoud rather fight the living Tanis interrupted How do you feel about that now The warrior did not answer More of those creatures are coming from both directions We cant fight off another assault But we wont enter Darken Wood if we dont have to Theres a game trail not far from here we can use to reach Prayers Eye Peak There we can see the road to the north as well as all other directions We could go north as far as the cave The boats hidden there Riverwind suggested No yelled Flint in a strangled voice Without another word the dwarf turned and plunged into the forest running south as fast as his short legs could carry him Flight The white stag The companions stumbled through the thick woods as fast as they could and soon reached the game trail Caramon took the lead sword in hand eyeing every shadow His brother followed one hand on Caramons shoulder his lips set in grim determination The rest came after their weapons drawn But they saw no more of the creatures Why arent they chasing us Flint asked after they had traveled about an hour Tanis scratched his beardhe had been wondering about the same thing They dont need to he said finally We are trapped Theyve undoubtedly blocked all the exits from this forest With the exception of Darken Wood Darken Wood Goldmoon repeated softly Is it truly necessary to go that way It may not be Tanis said Well get a look around from Prayers Eye Peak Suddenly they heard Caramon walking ahead of them shout Running forward Tanis found Raistlin had collapsed Ill be all right the mage whispered But I must rest We can all use rest Tanis said No one answered All sank down wearily catching their breath in quick sharp gasps Sturm closed his eyes and leaned against a mosscovered rock His face was a ghastly shade of grayish white Blood had matted his long moustaches and caked his hair The wound was a jagged slash turning slowly purple Tanis knew that the knight would die before he said a word of complaint Dont worry Sturm said harshly Just give me a moments peace Tanis gripped the knights hand briefly then went to sit beside Riverwind Neither spoke for long minutes then Tanis asked Youve fought those creatures before havent you In the broken city Riverwind shuddered It all came back to me when I looked inside the cart and saw that thing leering at me At least He paused shook his head Then he gave Tanis a halfsmile At least I know now that Im not going insane Those horrible creatures really do existI had wondered sometimes I can imagine Tanis murmured So these creatures are spreading all over Krynn unless your broken city was near here No I came into Queshu out of the east It was far from Solace beyond the Plains of my homeland What do you suppose those creatures meant saying they had tracked you to our village Goldmoon asked slowly laying her cheek on his leather tunic sleeve slipping her hand around his arm Dont worry Riverwind said taking her hand in his The warriors there would deal with them Riverwind do you remember what you were going to say she prompted Yes you are right Riverwind replied stroking her silvergold hair He looked at Tanis and smiled For an instant the expressionless mask was gone and Tanis saw warmth deep within the mans brown eyes I give my thanks to you HalfElven and to all of you His glance flickered over everyone You have saved our lives more than once and I have been ungrateful Buthe pausedits all so strange Its going to get stranger Raistlins voice was ominous The companions were drawing nearer Prayers Eye Peak They had been able to see it from the road rising above the forests Its split peak looked like two hands pressed together in prayerthus the name The rain had stopped The woods were deathly quiet The companions began to think that the forest animals and birds had vanished from the land leaving an eerie empty silence behind All of them felt uneasy except perhaps Tasslehoff and kept peering over their shoulders or drawing their swords at shadows Sturm insisted on walking rear guard but he began lagging behind as the pain in his head increased He was becoming dizzy and nauseated Soon he lost all conception of where he was and what he was doing He knew only that he must keep walking placing one foot in front of the other moving forward like one of Tass automatons How did Tass story go Sturm tried to remember it through a haze of pain These automatons served a wizard who had summoned a demon to carry the kender away It was nonsense like all the kenders stories Sturm put one foot in front of the other Nonsense Like the old mans storiesthe old man in the Inn Stories of the White Stag and ancient godsPaladine Stories of Huma Sturm clasped his hands on his throbbing temples as if he could hold his splitting head together Huma As a boy Sturm had fed on stories of Huma His motherdaughter of a Knight of Solamnia married to a Knighthad known no other stories to tell her son Sturms thoughts turned to his mother his pain making him think of her tender ministrations when he was sick or hurt Sturms father had sent his wife and their son into exile because the boyhis only heir was a target for those who would see the Knights of Solamnia banished forever from the face of Krynn Sturm and his mother took refuge in Solace Sturm made friends readily particularly with one other boy Caramon who shared his interest in all things military But Sturms proud mother considered the people beneath her And so when the fever consumed her she had died alone except for her teenage son She had commended the boy to his fatherif his father still lived which Sturm was beginning to doubt After his mothers death the young man became a seasoned warrior under the guidance of Tanis and Flint who adopted Sturm as they had unofficially adopted Caramon and Raistlin Together with Tasslehoff the travelloving kender and on occasion the twins wild and beautiful halfsister Kitiara Sturm and his friends escorted Flint on his journeys through the lands of Abanasinia plying his trade as metalsmith Five years ago however the companions decided to separate to investigate reports of evil growing in the land They vowed to meet again at the Inn of the Last Home Sturm had traveled north to Solamnia determined to find his father and his heritage He found nothing and only narrowly escaped with his lifeand his fathers sword and armor The journey to his homeland was a harrowing experience Sturm had known the Knights were reviled but he had been shocked to realize just how deep the bitterness against them ran Huma Lightbringer Knight of Solamnia had driven back the darkness years ago during the Age of Dreams and thus began the Age of Might Then came the Cataclysm when the gods abandoned manaccording to the popular belief The people had turned to the Knights for helpas they had turned to Huma in the past But Huma was long dead The Knights could only watch helplessly as terror rained down from heaven and Krynn was smote asunder The people had cried to the Knights but they could do nothing and the people had never forgiven them Standing in front of his familys ruined castle Sturm vowed that he would restore the honor of the Knights of Solamniaif it meant that he must sacrifice his life in the attempt But how could he do that fighting a bunch of clerics he wondered bitterly the trail dimming before his eyes He stumbled caught himself quickly Huma had fought dragons Give me dragons Sturm dreamed He lifted his eyes The leaves blurred into a golden mist and he knew he was going to faint Then he blinked Everything came sharply into focus Before him rose Prayers Eye Peak He and his companions had arrived at the foot of the old glacial mountain He could see trails twisting and winding up the wooded slope trails used by Solace residents to reach picnic spots on the eastern side of the Peak Next to one of the wellworn paths stood a white stag Sturm stared The stag was the most magnificent animal the knight had ever seen It was huge standing several hands taller than any other stag the knight had hunted It held its head proudly its splendid rack gleaming like a crown Its eyes were deep brown against its pure white fur and it gazed at the knight intently as if it knew him Then with a slight shake of its head the stag bounded away to the southwest Stop the knight called out hoarsely The others whirled around in alarm drawing weapons Tanis came running back to him What is it Sturm The knight involuntarily put his hand to his aching head Im sorry Sturm Tanis said I didnt realize you were as sick as this We can rest Were at the foot of Prayers Eye Peak Im going to climb the mountain and see No Look The knight gripped Taniss shoulder and turned him around He pointed See it The white stag The white stag Tanis stared in the direction the knight indicated Where I dont There Sturm said softly He took a few steps forward toward the animal who had stopped and seemed to be waiting for him The stag nodded its great head It darted away again just a few steps then turned to face the knight once more He wants us to follow him Sturm gasped Like Huma The others had gathered around the knight now regarding him with expressions that ranged from deeply concerned to obviously skeptical I see no stag of any color Riverwind said his dark eyes scanning the forest Head wound Caramon nodded like a charlatan cleric Cmon Sturm lie down and rest while You great blithering idiot the knight snarled at Caramon With your brains in your stomach it is just as well you do not see the stag You would probably shoot it and cook it I tell you thiswe must follow it The madness of the head wound Riverwind whispered to Tanis I have seen it often Im not sure Tanis said He was silent for a few moments When he spoke it was with obvious reluctance Though I have not seen the white stag myself I have been with one who has and I have followed it like in the old mans story His hand absently fingered the ring of twisted ivy leaves that he wore on his left hand his thoughts with the goldenhaired elfmaiden who wept when he left Qualinesti Youre suggesting we follow an animal we cant even see Caramon said his jaw going slack It would not be the strangest thing we had done Raistlin commented sarcastically in his whispering voice Though remember it was the old man who told the tale of the White Stag and the old man who got us into this It was our own choice got us into this Tanis snapped We could have turned the staff over to the High Theocrat and talked our way out of the predicament weve talked our way out of worse I say we follow Sturm He has been chosen apparently just as Riverwind was chosen to receive the staff But its not even leading us in the right direction Caramon argued You know as well as I do there are no trails through the western part of the woods No one ever goes there All the better Goldmoon said suddenly Tanis said those creatures must have the paths blocked Maybe this is a way out I say we follow the knight She turned and started off with Sturm not even glancing back at the othersobviously accustomed to being obeyed Riverwind shrugged and shook his head scowling darkly but he walked after Goldmoon and the others followed The knight left the welltrodden paths of Prayers Eye Peak behind moving in a southwesterly direction up the slope At first it appeared Caramon was rightthere were no trails Sturm was crashing through the brush like a madman Then suddenly a smooth wide trail opened up ahead of them Tanis stared at it in amazement What or who cleared this trail he asked Riverwind who was also examining it with a puzzled expression I dont know the Plainsman said Its old That felled tree has lain there long enough to sink over halfway into the dirt and its covered with moss and vines But there are no tracks other than Sturms Theres no sign of anyone or any animal passing through here Yet why isnt it overgrown Tanis couldnt answer and he couldnt take time to think about it Sturm forged ahead rapidly all the party could do was try to keep him in sight Goblins boats lizard men invisible stags what next complained Flint to the kender I wish I could see the stag Tas said wistfully Get hit on the head The dwarf snorted Although with you we probably couldnt tell the difference The companions followed Sturm who was climbing with a wild kind of elation his pain and wound forgotten Tanis had difficulty catching up with the knight When he did he was alarmed at the feverish gleam in Sturms eye But the knight was obviously being guided by something The trail led them up the slope of Prayers Eye Peak Tanis saw that it was taking them to the gap between the hands of stone a gap that as far as he knew no one had ever entered before Wait a moment he gasped running to catch up with Sturm It was nearly midday he guessed though the sun was still hidden by jagged gray clouds Lets rest Im going to take a look at the land from over there He pointed to a rock ledge that jutted out from the side of the peak Rest repeated Sturm vaguely stopping and catching his breath He stared ahead for a moment then turned to Tanis Yes Well rest His eyes gleamed brightly Are you all right Fine Sturm said absently and paced around the grass gently stroking and smoothing his moustaches Tanis looked at him a moment irresolute then went back to the others who were just coming over the crest of a small rise Were going to rest here the halfelf said Raistlin breathed a sigh of relief and sank down in the wet leaves Im going to have a look north see whats moving back on the road to Haven Tanis added Ill come with you Riverwind offered Tanis nodded and the two left the path heading for the rock ledge Tanis glanced at the tall warrior as they walked together He was beginning to feel comfortable with the stern serious Plainsman A deeply private person himself Riverwind respected the privacy of others and would never think of probing the boundaries Tanis set around his soul This was as relaxing to the halfelf as a nights unbroken sleep He knew that his friendssimply because they were his friends and had known him for yearswere speculating on his relationship with Kitiara Why had he chosen to break it off so abruptly five years ago And why then his obvious disappointment when she failed to join them Riverwind of course knew nothing about Kitiara but Tanis had the feeling that if he did it would be all the same to the Plainsman it was Taniss business not his When they were within sight of the Haven Road they crawled the last few feet inching their way along the wet rock until they came to the rim of the ledge Tanis looking below and to the east could see the old picnic paths disappearing around the side of the mountain Riverwind pointed and Tanis realized there were creatures moving along the picnic trails That explained the uncanny hush in the forest Tanis pressed his lips together grimly The creatures must be waiting to ambush them Sturm and his white stag had probably saved their lives But it wouldnt take the creatures long to find this new trail Tanis glanced below him and blinked there was no trail There was nothing but thick impenetrable forest The trail had closed behind them I must be imagining things he thought and he turned his eyes back to Haven Road and the many creatures moving along it It hadnt taken them long to get organized he thought He gazed farther to the north and saw the still peaceful waters of Crystalmir Lake Then his glance traveled to the horizon He frowned There was something wrong He couldnt place it immediately so he said nothing to Riverwind but stared at the skyline Storm clouds massed in the north more thickly than ever long gray fingers raking the land And reaching up to meet themthat was it Gripping Riverwinds arm Tanis stabbed his finger northward Riverwind looked squinting seeing nothing at first Then he saw itblack smoke drifting into the sky His thick heavy brows contracted Campfires Tanis said Many hundred campfires Riverwind amended softly The fires of war That is an army encampment So the rumors are confirmed Sturm said when they returned There is an army to the north But what army Whose And why What are they going to attack Caramon laughed incredulously No one would send an army after this staff The warrior paused Would they The staff is but a part of this Raistlin hissed Remember the fallen stars Childrens stories Flint sniffed He upended the empty wineskin shook it and sighed My stories are not for children Raistlin said viciously twisting up from the leaves like a snake And you would do well to heed my words dwarf There it is Theres the stag Sturm said suddenly his eyes staring straight at a large boulderor so it seemed to his companions It is time to go The knight began walking The others hastily gathered their gear together and hurried after him As they climbed ever farther up the trailwhich seemed to materialize before them as they wentthe wind switched and began blowing from the south It was a warm breeze carrying with it the fragrance of lateblooming autumn wildflowers It drove back the storm clouds and just as they came to the cleft between the two halves of the Peak the sun broke free It was well past midday when they stopped to rest for one more brief period before attempting the climb through the narrow gap between the walls of Prayers Eye Peak through which Sturm said they must go The stag had led the way he insisted Itll be suppertime soon Caramon said He heaved a gusty sigh staring at his feet I could eat my boots Theyre beginning to look good to me too Flint said grumpily I wish that stag was flesh and blood It might be useful for something besides getting us lost Shut up Sturm turned on the dwarf in a sudden rage his fists clenched Tanis rose quickly put his hand on the knights shoulder holding him back Sturm stood glaring at the dwarf moustaches quivering then he jerked away from Tanis Lets go he muttered As the companions entered the narrow defile they could see clear blue sky on the other side The south wind whistled across the steep white walls of the Peak soaring above them They walked carefully small stones causing their feet to slip more than once Fortunately the way was so narrow that they could easily regain their balance by catching themselves against the steep walls After about thirty minutes of walking they came out on the other side of Prayers Eye Peak They halted staring down into a valley Lush grassy meadowland flowed in green waves below them to lap on the shores of a lightgreen aspen forest far to the south The storm clouds were behind them and the sun shone brightly in a clear azure sky For the first time they found their cloaks too heavy except for Raistlin who remained huddled in his red hooded cape Flint had spent the morning complaining about the rain and now started on the sunshineit was too bright glaring into his eyes It was too hot beating down on his helm I say we throw the dwarf off the mountain growled Caramon to Tanis Tanis grinned Hed rattle all the way down and give away our position Whos down there to hear him Caramon said gesturing toward the valley with his broad hand I bet were the first living beings to set eyes on this valley First living beings Raistlin breathed You are right there my brother For you look on Darken Wood No one spoke Riverwind shifted uncomfortably Goldmoon crept over to stand beside him staring down into the green trees her eyes wide Flint cleared his throat and fell silent stroking his long beard Sturm regarded the forest calmly So did Tasslehoff It doesnt look bad at all the kender said cheerfully Sitting crosslegged on the ground a sheaf of parchment spread out on his knees he was drawing a map with a bit of charcoal attempting to trace their way up Prayers Eye Peak Looks are as deceptive as lightfingered kender Raistlin whispered harshly Tasslehoff frowned started to retort then caught Taniss eye and went back to his drawing Tanis walked over to Sturm The knight stood out on a ledge the south wind blowing back his long hair and whipping his frayed cape about him Sturm where is the stag Do you see it now Yes Sturm answered He pointed downward It walked across the meadow I can see its trail in the tall grass It has gone into the aspens there Gone into Darken Wood Tanis murmured Who says that is Darken Wood Sturm turned to face Tanis Raistlin Bah He is magi Tanis said He is crazed Sturm replied Then he shrugged But stay here rooted on the side of the Peak if you like Tanis I will follow the stagas did Humaeven if it leads me into Darken Wood Wrapping his cloak around him Sturm climbed down the ledge and began to walk along a winding trail that led down the mountainside Tanis returned to the others The stags leading him on a straight path right into the forest he said How certain are you that this forest is Darken Wood Raistlin How certain is one of anything HalfElven the mage replied I am not certain of drawing my next breath But go ahead Walk into the wood that no living man has ever walked out of Death is lifes one great certainty Tanis The halfelf felt a sudden urge to throw Raistlin off the side of the mountain He stared after Sturm who was nearly halfway down into the valley Im going with Sturm he said suddenly But Ill be responsible for no one else in this decision The rest of you may follow as you choose Im coming Tasslehoff rolled his map up and slipped it into his scroll case He scrambled to his feet sliding in the loose rock Ghosts Flint scowled at Raistlin snapped his fingers derisively then stumped over to stand beside the halfelf Goldmoon followed unhesitatingly though her face was pale Riverwind joined the group more slowly his face thoughtful Tanis was relievedthe barbarians had many frightening legends of Darken Wood he knew And finally Raistlin moved forward so rapidly he took his brother completely by surprise Tanis regarded the mage with a slight smile Why do you come he couldnt help asking Because you will need me HalfElven the mage hissed Besides where would you have us go You have allowed us to be led this farthere can be no turning back It is the Ogres Choice you offer us TanisDie fast or die slow He set off down the side of the Peak Coming brother The others glanced uneasily at Tanis as the brothers passed The halfelf felt like a fool Raistlin was right of course Hed let this go far beyond his control then made it seem as if it were their decision not his allowing him to go forward with a clear conscience Angrily he picked up a rock and hurled it far down the mountainside Why was it his responsibility in the first place Why had he gotten involved when all he had wanted was to find Kitiara and tell her his mind was made uphe loved her and wanted her He could accept her human frailties as he had learned to accept his own But Kit hadnt come back to him She had a new lord Maybe thats why hed Ho Tanis The kenders voice floated up to him Im coming he muttered The sun was just beginning to dip into the west when the companions reached the edge of the forest Tanis figured they had at least three or four hours of daylight left If the stag continued to lead them on smooth clear trails they might be able to get through this forest before darkness fell Sturm waited for them beneath the aspens resting comfortably in the leafy green shade The companions left the meadow slowly none of them in any hurry to enter the woods The stag entered here Sturm said rising to his feet and pointing into the tall grass Tanis saw no tracks He took a drink of water from his nearly empty waterskin and stared into the forest As Tasslehoff had said the wood did not seem sinister In fact it looked cool and inviting after the harsh brilliance of the autumn sunshine Maybe therell be some game in here Caramon said rocking back on his heels Not stags of course he added hastily Rabbits maybe Shoot nothing Eat nothing Drink nothing in Darken Wood Raistlin whispered Tanis looked at the mage whose hourglass eyes were dilated The metallic skin shone a ghastly color in the strong sunlight Raistlin leaned upon his staff shivering as if from a chill Childrens stories Flint muttered but the dwarfs voice lacked conviction Although Tanis knew Raistlins flair for the dramatic he had never seen the mage affected like this before What do you sense Raistlin he asked quietly There is a great and powerful magic laid on this wood whispered Raistlin Evil asked Tanis Only to those who bring evil in with them the mage stated Then you are the only one who need fear this forest Sturm told the mage coldly Caramons face flushed an ugly red his hand fumbled for his sword Sturms hand went to his blade Tanis gripped Sturms arm as Raistlin touched his brother The mage stared at the knight his golden eyes glimmering We shall see Raistlin said the words nothing more than hissing sounds flicking between his teeth We shall see Then leaning heavily upon his staff Raistlin turned to his brother Coming Caramon glared angrily at Sturm then entered the wood walking beside his twin The others moved after them leaving only Tanis and Flint standing in the long waving grass Im getting too old for this Tanis the dwarf said suddenly Nonsense the halfelf replied smiling You fought like a No I dont mean the bones or the musclesthe dwarf looked at his gnarled hands though theyre old enough I mean the spirit Years ago before the others were born you and I would have walked into a magicked wood without giving it a second thought Now Cheer up Tanis said He tried to sound light though he was deeply disturbed by the dwarfs unusual somberness He studied Flint closely for the first time since meeting outside Solace The dwarf looked old but then Flint had always looked old His face what could be seen through the mass of gray beard and moustaches and overhanging white eyebrows was brown and wrinkled and cracked like old leather The dwarf grumbled and complained but then Flint had always grumbled and complained The change was in the eyes The fiery luster was gone Dont let Raistlin get to you Tanis said Well sit around the fire tonight and laugh at his ghost stories I suppose so Flint sighed He was silent a moment then said Someday Ill slow you up Tanis I dont ever want you to think why do I put up with this grumbling old dwarf Because I need you grumbling old dwarf Tanis said putting his hand on the dwarfs heavyset shoulder He motioned into the wood after the others I need you Flint Theyre all so so young Youre like a solid rock that I can set my back against as I wield my sword Flints face flushed in pleasure He tugged at his beard then cleared his throat gruffly Yes well you were always sentimental Come along Were wasting time I want to get through this confounded forest as fast as possible Then he muttered Just glad its daylight Darken Wood The dead walk Raistlins magic The only thing Tanis felt on entering the forest was relief at being out of the glare of the autumn sun The halfelf recalled all the legends he had heard about Darken Woodstories of ghosts told around the fire at nightand he kept in mind Raistlins foreboding But all Tanis felt was that the forest was so much more alive than any other he had ever entered There was no deathly hush as they had experienced earlier Small animals chattered in the brush Birds fluttered in the high branches above them Insects with gaily colored wings flitted past Leaves rustled and stirred flowers swayed though no breeze touched themas if the plants reveled in being alive All of the companions entered the forest with their hands on their weapons wary and watchful and distrustful After a time of trying to avoid making leaves crunch Tas said it seemed kind of silly and they relaxedall except Raistlin They walked for about two hours traveling at a smooth but rapid easy pace along a smooth and clear trail Shadows lengthened as the sun made its downward slide Tanis felt at peace in this forest He had no fear that the awful winged creatures could follow them here Evil seemed out of place unless as Raistlin said one brought ones own evil into the wood Tanis looked at the mage Raistlin walked alone his head bowed The shadows of the forest trees seemed to gather thickly around the young mage Tanis shivered and realized that the air was turning cool as the sun dropped below the treetops It was time to begin thinking about making camp for the night Tanis pulled out Tasslehoffs map to study it once more before the light faded The map was of elven design and written across the forest in flowing script were the words Darken Wood But the woods themselves were only vaguely outlined and Tanis couldnt be certain if the words pertained to this forest or one farther south Raistlin must be wrong Tanis decided this cant be Darken Wood Or if so its evil was simply a product of the mages imagination They walked on Soon it was twilight that time of evening when the dying light makes everything most vivid and distinct The companions began to lag Raistlin limped and his breath came in wheezing gasps Sturms face turned ashen The halfelf was just about to call a halt for the night whenas if anticipating his wishesthe trail led them right to a large green glade Clear water bubbled up from underground and trickled down smooth rocks to form a shallow brook The glade was blanketed with thick inviting grass tall trees stood guard duty on the edges As they saw the glade the suns light reddened then faded and the misty shades of night crept around the trees Do not leave the path Raistlin intoned as his companions started to enter the glade Tanis sighed Raistlin he said patiently well be all right The path is in plain sightnot ten feet away Come on Youve got to rest We all do LookTanis held out the mapI dont think this is Darken Wood According to this Raistlin ignored the map with disdain The rest of the companions ignored the mage and moving off the path began setting up camp Sturm sank down against a tree his eyes closed in pain while Caramon stared at the smaller fleeting shadows with a hungry eye At a signal from Caramon Tasslehoff slipped off into the forest after firewood Watching them the mages face twisted in a sardonic smile You are all fools This is Darken Wood as you will see before the night is ended He shrugged But as you say I need rest However I will not leave the path Raistlin sat down on the trail his staff beside him Caramon flushed in embarrassment as he saw the others exchanging amused glances Aw Raist the big man said join us Tas has gone for wood and maybe I can shoot a rabbit Shoot nothing Raistlin actually spoke above a whisper making everyone start Harm nothing in Darken Wood Neither plant nor tree bird nor animal I agree with Raistlin Tanis said We have to spend the night here and I dont want to kill any animal in this forest if we dont have to Elves never want to kill period Flint grumbled The magician scares us to death and you starve us Well if anything does attack us tonight I hope its edible You and me both dwarf Caramon heaved a sigh went over to the creek and began trying to assuage his hunger by drowning it Tasslehoff returned with firewood I didnt cut it he assured Raistlin I just picked it up But even Riverwind couldnt make the wood catch fire The woods wet he stated finally and tossed his tinderbox back into his pack We need light Flint said uneasily as nights shadows closed in thickly Sounds in the woods that had been innocent in the daytime now seemed sinister and threatening Surely you do not fear childrens stories Raistlin hissed No snapped the dwarf I just want to make certain the kender doesnt rifle my pack in the dark Very well said Raistlin with unusual mildness He spoke his word of command Shirak A pale white light shone from the crystal on the tip of the mages staff It was a ghostly light and did little to brighten the darkness In fact it seemed to emphasize the menace in the night There you have light the mage whispered softly He thrust the bottom of the staff into the wet ground It was then Tanis realized his elven vision was gone He should have been able to see the warm red outlines of his companions but they were nothing more than darker shadows against the starry darkness of the glade The halfelf didnt say anything to the others but the peaceful feeling he had been enjoying was pierced by a sliver of fear Ill take the first watch Sturm offered heavily I shouldnt sleep with this head wound anyway I once knew a man who didhe never woke up Well watch in twos Tanis said Ill take first watch with you The others opened packs and began making up beds on the grass except for Raistlin He remained sitting on the trail the light of his staff shining on his bowed hooded head Sturm settled down beneath a tree Tanis walked over to the brook and drank thirstily Suddenly he heard a strangled cry behind him He drew his sword and stood all in one motion The others had their weapons drawn Only Raistlin sat unmoving Put your swords away he said They will do you no good Only a weapon of powerful magic could harm these An army of warriors surrounded them That alone would have been enough to chill anyones blood But the companions could have dealt with that What they couldnt handle was the horror that overwhelmed and numbed their senses Each one recalled Caramons flippant comment Ill fight the living any day of the week but not the dead These warriors were dead Nothing more than fleeting fragile white light outlined their bodies It was as if the human warmth that had been theirs while they lived lingered on horribly after death The flesh had rotted away leaving behind the bodys image as remembered by the soul The soul apparently remembered other things too Each warrior was dressed in ancient remembered armor Each warrior carried remembered weapons that could inflict well remembered death But the undead needed no weapons They could kill from fear alone or by the touch of their gravecold hands How can we fight these things Tanis thought wildly he who had never felt such fear in the face of flesh and blood enemies Panic engulfed him and he considered yelling for the others to turn and run for it Angrily the halfelf forced himself to calm down to get a grip on reality Reality He almost laughed at the irony Running was useless they would get lost separated They had to stay and deal with thissomehow He began to walk toward the ghostly warriors The dead said nothing made no threatening moves They simply stood blocking the path It was impossible to count them since some glimmered into being while others faded only to return when their comrades dimmed Not that it makes any difference Tanis admitted to himself feeling sweat chill his body One of these undead warriors could kill all of us simply by lifting its hand As the halfelf drew nearer to the warriors he saw a gleam of light Raistlins staff The mage leaning on his staff stood in front of the huddle of companions Tanis came to stand beside him The pale crystal light reflected on the mages face making it seem nearly as ghostly as the faces of the dead before him Welcome to Darken Wood Tanis the mage said Raistlin Tanis choked He had to try more than once to get his dry throat to form a sound What are these Spectral minions the mage whispered without taking his eyes from them We are fortunate Fortunate Tanis repeated increduously Why These are the spirits of men who gave their pledge to perform some task They failed in that pledge and it is their doom to keep performing the same task over and over until they win their release and find true rest in death How in the name of the Abyss does that make us fortunate Tanis whispered harshly releasing his fear in anger Perhaps they pledged to rid the forest of all who entered That is possibleRaistlin flickered a glance at the halfelfthough I do not think it likely We will find out Before Tanis could react the mage stepped away from the group and faced the spectres Raist Caramon said in a strangled voice starting to shove forward Keep him back Tanis Raistlin commanded harshly Our lives depend on this Gripping the warriors arm Tanis asked Raistlin What are you going to do I am going to cast a spell that will enable us to communicate with them I will perceive their thoughts They will speak through me The mage threw his head back his hood slipping off He stretched out his arms and began to speak Ast bilak parbilakar Suh tangus moiparhe murmured then repeated that phrase three times As Raistlin spoke the crowd of warriors parted and a figure more awesome and terrifying than the rest appeared The spectre was taller than the rest and wore a shimmering crown His pallid armor was richly decorated with dark jewels His face showed the most terrible grief and anguish He advanced upon Raistlin Caramon choked and averted his eyes Tanis dared not speak or cry out fearful of disturbing the mage and breaking the spell The spectre raised a fleshless hand reached out slowly to touch the young mage Tanis trembledthe spectres touch meant certain death But Raistlin entranced did not move Tanis wondered if he even saw the chill hand coming toward his heart Then Raistlin spoke You who have been long dead use my living voice to tell us of your bitter sorrow Then give us leave to pass through this forest for our purpose is not evil as you will see if you read our hearts The spectres hand halted abruptly The pale eyes searched Raistlins face Then shimmering in the darkness the spectre bowed before the mage Tanis sucked in his breath he had sensed Raistlins power but this Raistlin returned the bow then moved to stand beside the spectre His face was nearly as pale as that of the ghostly figure next to him The living dead and the dead living Tanis thought shuddering When Raistlin spoke his voice was no longer the wheezing whisper of the fragile mage It was deep and dark and commanding and rang through the forest It was cold and hollow and might have come from below the ground Who are you who trespass in Darken Wood Tanis tried to answer but his throat had dried up completely Caramon next to him couldnt even lift his head Then Tanis felt movement at his side The kender Cursing himself he reached out to grab for Tasslehoff but it was too late The small figure topknot dancing ran out into the light of Raistlins staff and stood before the spectre Tasslehoff bowed respectfully I am Tasslehoff Burrfoot he said My friendshe waved his small hand at the group call me Tas Who are you It matters little the sepulchral voice intoned Know only that we are warriors from a time long forgotten Is it true that you broke a pledge and thats how you come to be here Tas asked with interest It is We pledged to guard this land Then came the smoldering mountain from the heavens The land was ripped apart Evil things crept out from the bowels of the earth and we dropped our swords and fled in terror until bitter death overtook us We have been called to fulfill our oath as evil once more stalks the land And here will we remain until evil is driven back and balance is restored again Suddenly Raistlin gave a shriek and flung back his head his eyes rolling upwards until the watching companions could see only the whites His voice became a thousand voices crying out at once This startled even the kender who stepped back a pace and looked around uneasily for Tanis The spectre raised his hand in a commanding gesture and the tumult ceased as though swallowed by the darkness My men demand to know the reason you enter Darken Wood If it is for evil you will find that you have brought evil upon yourselves for you will not live to see the moons rise No not evil Certainly not Tasslehoff said hurriedly Its kind of a long story you see but were obviously not going anywhere in a big hurry and youre obviously not either so Ill tell it to you To begin with we were in the Inn of the Last Home in Solace You probably dont know it Im not sure how long its been there but it wasnt around during the Cataclysm and it sounds like you were Well there we were listening to the old man talking of Huma and hethe old man not Humatold Goldmoon to sing her song and she said what song and then she sang and a Seeker decided to be a music critic and Riverwindthats the tall man over there shoved the Seeker into the fire It was an accidenthe didnt mean to But the Seeker went up like a torch You should have seen it Anyway the old man handed me the staff and said hit him and I did and the staff turned to blue crystal and the flames died and Blue crystal The spectres voice echoed hollowly from Raistlins throat as he began to walk toward them Tanis and Strum both jumped forward grabbing Tas and dragging him out of the way But the spectre seemed intent only on examining the group His flickering eyes focused on Goldmoon Raising a pale hand he motioned her forward No Riverwind tried to prevent her from leaving his side but she pushed away gently and walked over to stand before the spectre the staff in her hand The ghostly army encircled them Suddenly the spectre drew his sword from its pallid sheath He held it high overhead and white light tinged with blue flame flickered from the blade Look at the staff Goldmoon gasped The staff glowed pale blue as if answering the sword The ghostly king turned to Raistlin and reached his pale hand toward the entranced mage Caramon gave a hoarse bellow and broke free of Taniss grip Drawing his sword he lunged at the undead warrior The blade pierced the flickering body but it was Caramon who screamed in pain and dropped writhing to the ground Tanis and Sturm knelt beside him Raistlin stared ahead his expression unchanged unmoving Caramon where Tanis held him trying frantically to see where the big man was injured My hand Caramon rocked back and forth sobbing his left handhis sword handthrust tightly under his right arm Whats the matter Tanis asked Then seeing the warriors sword on the ground he knew Caramons sword was rimed with frost Tanis looked up in horror and saw the spectres hand close tightly around Raistlins wrist A shudder wracked the mages frail body his face twisted in pain but he did not fall The mages eyes closed the lines of cynicism and bitterness smoothed away and the peace of death descended on him Tanis watched in awe only partially aware of Caramons hoarse cries He saw Raistlins face transform again this time imbued with ecstasy The mages aura of power intensified until it glowed around him with an almost palpable brilliance We are summoned Raistlin said The voice was his own and yet like none Tanis had ever heard him use We must go The mage turned his back on them and walked into the woods the ghostly kings fleshless hand still grasping his wrist The circle of undead parted to let him pass Stop them Caramon moaned He staggered to his feet We cant Tanis fought to restrain him and finally the big man collapsed in the halfelfs arms weeping like a child Well follow him Hell be all right Hes magi Caramonwe cant understand Well follow The eyes of the undead flickered with an unholy light as they watched the companions pass them and enter the forest The spectral army closed ranks behind them The companions stepped into a raging battle Steel rang wounded men shrieked for help So real was the clash of armies in the darkness that Sturm drew his sword reflexively The tumult deafened him he ducked and dodged unseen blows that he knew were aimed at him He swung his sword in desperation black air knowing that he was doomed and there was no escape He began to run and he suddenly stumbled out of the forest into a barren wasted glade Raistlin stood before him alone The mages eyes were closed He sighed gently then collapsed to the ground Sturm ran to him then Caramon appeared nearly knocking Sturm over to reach his brother and gather him tenderly in his arms One by one the others ran as if driven into the glade Raistlin was still murmuring strange unfamiliar words The spectres vanished Raist Caramon sobbed brokenly The mages eyelids flickered and opened The spell drained me he whispered I must rest And rest ye shall boomed a voicea living voice Tanis breathed a sigh of relief even as he put his hand on his sword Quickly he and the others jumped protectively in front of Raistlin turning to face outward staring into the darkness Then the silver moon appeared suddenly as if a hand had produced it from beneath a black silk scarf Now they could see the head and shoulders of a man standing amid the trees His bare shoulders were as large and heavy as Caramons A mane of long hair curled around his neck his eyes were bright and glittered coldly The companions heard a rustling in the brush and saw the flash of a spear tip being raised pointing at Tanis Put thy puny weapons down the man warned Ye be surrounded and have not a chance A trick Sturm growled but even as he spoke there was a tremendous crashing and cracking of tree limbs More men appeared surrounding them all armed with spears that glinted in the moonlight The first man strode forward then and the companions stared in amazement their hands on their weapons going slack The man wasnt a man at all but a centaur Human from the waist up he had the body of a horse from the waist down He cantered forward with easy grace powerful muscles rippling across his barrel chest Other centaurs moved into the path at his commanding gesture Tanis sheathed his sword Flint sneezed Thee must come with us the centaur ordered My brother is ill Caramon growled He cant go anywhere Place him upon my back the centaur said coolly In fact if any of you be tired thee may ride to where we go Where are you taking us Tanis asked Thee is in no position to ask questions The centaur reached out and prodded Caramons back with his spear We travel far and fast I suggest thee ride But fear not He bowed before Goldmoon extending his foreleg and touching his hand to his shaggy hair Harm will not come to thee this night Can I ride Tanis please begged Tasslehoff Dont trust them Flint sneezed violently I dont trust them Tanis muttered but we dont seem to have a whole lot of choice in the matterRaistlin cant walk Go on Tas The rest of you too Caramon scowling at the centaurs suspiciously lifted his brother in his arms and set him upon the back of one of the halfman halfanimal Raistlin slumped forward weakly Climb up the centaur said to Caramon I can bear the weight of thee both Thy brother will need thy support for we ride swiftly tonight Flushing with embarrassment the big warrior clambered onto the centaurs broad back his huge legs dangling almost to the ground He put an arm around Raistlin as the centaur galloped down the path Tasslehoff giggling with excitement jumped onto a centaur and promptly slid off the other side into the mud Sturm sighing picked up the kender and set him on the centaurs back Then before Flint could protest the knight lifted the dwarf up behind Tas Flint tried to speak but could only sneeze as the centaur moved away Tanis rode with the first centaur who seemed to be the leader Where are you taking us Tanis asked again To the Forestmaster the centaur answered The Forestmaster Tanis repeated Who is heone like yourselves She is the Forestmaster the centaur replied and began to canter down the trail Tanis started to ask another question but the centaurs quickened pace jolted him and he nearly bit through his tongue as he came down hard on the centaurs back Feeling himself start to slide backwards as the centaur trotted faster and faster Tanis threw his arms around the centaurs broad torso Nar thee doesnt need to squeeze me in two The centaur glanced back his eyes glittering in the moonlight It be my job to see thee stays on Relax Put thy hands on me rump to balance thyself There now Grip with thy legs The centaurs left the trail and plunged into the forest The moonlight was immediately swallowed up by the dense trees Tanis felt branches whip past swiping at his clothing The centaur never swerved or slowed in his gallop however and Tanis could only assume he knew the trail well a trail the halfelf couldnt see Soon the pace began to slacken and the centaur finally came to a stop Tanis could see nothing in the smothering darkness He knew his companions were near only because he could hear Raistlins shallow breathing Caramons jingling armor and Flints unabated sneezing Even the light from Raistlins staff had died A powerful magic is laid on this forest the mage whispered weakly when Tanis asked him about it This magic dispels all others Taniss uneasiness grew Why are we stopping Because thee art here Dismount the centaur ordered gruffly Where is here Tanis slid off the centaurs broad back onto the ground He stared around him but could see nothing Apparently the trees kept even the smallest glimmer of moonlight or starlight from penetrating through to the trail Thee stands in the center of Darken Wood the centaur replied And now I bid thee farewellor fare evil depending on how the Forestmaster judges thee Wait a minute Caramon called out angrily You cant just leave us here in the middle of this forest blind as newborn kittens Stop them Tanis ordered reaching for his sword But his weapon was gone An explosive oath from Sturm indicated the knight had discovered the same thing The centaur chuckled Tanis heard hooves beat into soft earth and tree branches rustled The centaurs were gone Good riddance Flint sneezed Are we all here Tanis asked reaching out his hand and feeling Sturms strong reassuring grasp Im here piped Tasslehoff Oh Tanis wasnt it wonderful I Hush Tas Tanis snapped The Plainsmen Were here said Riverwind grimly Weaponless No one has a weapon Tanis asked Not that it would do us much good in this cursed blackness he amended bitterly I have my staff Goldmoons low voice said softly And a formidable weapon that is daughter of Queshu came a deep voice A weapon for good intended to combat illness and injury and disease The unseen voice grew sad In these times it will also be used as a weapon against the evil creatures who seek to find and banish it from the world The Forestmaster A peaceful interlude Who are you Tanis called Show yourself We will not harm you bluffed Caramon Of course you wont Now the deep voice was amused You have no weapons I will return them when the time is propitious No one brings weapons into Darken Wood not even a Knight of Solamnia Do not fear noble knight I recognize your blade as ancient and most valuable I will keep it safe Forgive this apparent lack of trust but even the great Huma laid the Dragonlance at my feet Huma Sturm gasped Who are you I am the Forestmaster Even as the deep voice spoke the darkness parted A gasp of awe gentle as a spring wind swept the company as they stared before them Silver moonlight shone brightly on a high rock ledge Standing on the ledge was a unicorn She regarded them coolly her intelligent eyes gleaming with infinite wisdom The unicorns beauty pierced the heart Goldmoon felt swift tears spring to her eyes and she was forced to close them against the animals magnificent radiance Her fur was the silver of moonlight her horn was shining pearl her mane like seafoam The head might have been sculpted from glistening marble but no human or even dwarven hand could capture the elegance and grace that lived in the fine lines of the powerful neck and muscular chest The legs were strong but delicate the hooves small and cloven like those of a goat In later days when Goldmoon walked dark paths and her heart was bleak with despair and hopelessness she had only to shut her eyes and remember the unicorn to find comfort The unicorn tossed her head and then lowered it in grave welcome The companions feeling awkward and clumsy and confused bowed in return The unicorn suddenly whirled and left the rock ledge cantering down the rocks toward them Tanis feeling a spell lifted from him looked around The bright silver moonlight lit a sylvan glade Tall trees surrounded them like giant beneficent guardians The halfelf was aware of a deep abiding sense of peace here But there was also a waiting sadness Rest yourselves the Forestmaster said as she came among them You are tired and hungry Food will be brought and fresh water for cleansing You may put aside your watchfulness and fears for this evening Safety exists here if it exists anywhere in this land tonight Caramon his eyes lighting up at the mention of food eased his brother to the ground Raistlin sank into the grass against the trunk of a tree His face was deathly pale in the silver moonlight but his breathing was easy He did not seem ill so much as just terribly exhausted Caramon sat next to him looking around for food Then he heaved a sigh Probably more berries anyway the warrior said unhappily to Tanis I crave meat roasted deer haunch a nice sizzling bit of rabbit Hush Sturm remonstrated softly glancing at the Forestmaster Shed probably consider roasting you first Centaurs came out of the forest bearing a clean white cloth which they spread on the grass Others placed clear crystal globe lights on the cloth illuminating the forest Tasslehoff stared at the lights curiously Theyre bug lights The crystal globes held thousands of tiny bugs each one having two brightly glowing spots on its back They crawled around inside the globes apparently content to explore their surroundings Next the centaurs brought bowls of cool water and clean white cloths to bathe their faces and hands The water refreshed their bodies and minds as it washed away the stains of battle Other centaurs placed chairs which Caramon stared at dubiously They were crafted of one piece of wood that curved around the body They appeared comfortable except that each chair had only one leg Please be seated said the Forestmaster graciously I cant sit in that the warrior protested Ill tip over He stood at the edge of the tablecloth Besides the tablecloth is spread on the grass Ill sit on the grass with it Close to the food muttered Flint into his beard The others glanced uneasily at the chairs the strange crystal bug lamps and the centaurs The Chieftains Daughter however knew what was expected of guests Although the outside world might have considered her people barbarians Goldmoons tribe had strict rules of politeness that must be religiously observed Goldmoon knew that to keep your host waiting was an insult to both the host and his bounty She sat down with regal grace The onelegged chair rocked slightly adjusting to her height crafting itself for her alone Sit at my right hand warrior she said formally conscious of the many eyes upon them Riverwinds face showed no emotion though he was a ludicrous sight trying to bend his tall body to sit in the seemingly fragile chair Butonce seatedhe leaned back comfortably almost smiling in disbelieving approval Thank you all for waiting until I was seated Goldmoon said hastily to cover the others hesitation You may all sit now Oh thats all right began Caramon folding his arms across his chest I wasnt waiting Im not going to sit in these weird chair Sturms elbow dug sharply into the warriors ribs Gracious lady Sturm bowed and sat down with knightly dignity Well if he can do it so can I muttered Caramon his decision hastened by the fact that the centaurs were bringing in food He helped his brother to a seat and then sat down gingerly making certain the chair bore his weight Four centaurs positioned themselves at each of the four corners of the huge white cloth spread out upon the ground They lifted the cloth to the height of a table then released it The cloth remained floating in place its delicately embroidered surface as hard and sturdy as one of the solid tables in the Inn of the Last Home How splendid How do they do that Tasslehoff cried peering underneath the cloth Theres nothing under there he reported his eyes wide The centaurs laughed uproariously and even the Forestmaster smiled Next the centaurs laid down plates made of beautifully cut and polished wood Each guest was given a knife and fork fashioned from the horns of a deer Platters of hot roasted meat filled the air with a tantalizing smoky aroma Fragrant loaves of bread and huge wooden bowls of fruit glistened in the soft lamplight Caramon feeling secure in his chair rubbed his hands together Then he grinned broadly and picked up his fork Ahhhh He sighed in appreciation as one of the centaurs set before him a platter of roasted deer meat Caramon plunged his fork in sniffing in rapture at the steam and juice that gushed forth from the meat Suddenly he realized everyone was staring at him He stopped and looked around Wha he asked blinking Then his eyes rested on the Forestmaster and he flushed and hurriedly removed his fork I I beg your pardon This deer must have been someone you knewI meanone of your subjects The Forestmaster smiled gently Be at ease warrior she said The deer fulfills his purpose in life by providing sustenance for the hunterbe it wolf or man We do not mourn the loss of those who die fulfilling their destinies It seemed to Tanis that the Forestmasters dark eyes went to Sturm as she spoke and there was a deep sadness in them that filled the halfelfs heart with cold fear But when he turned back to the Forestmaster he saw the magnificent animal smiling once more My imagination he thought How do we know Master Tanis asked hesitantly whether the life of any creature has fulfilled its destiny I have known the very old to die in bitterness and despair I have seen young children die before their time but leave behind such a legacy of love and joy that grief for their passing was tempered by the knowledge that their brief lives had given much to others You have answered your own question Tanis HalfElven far better than I could the Forestmaster said gravely Say that our lives are measured not by gain but by giving The halfelf started to reply but the Forestmaster interrupted Put your cares aside for now Enjoy the peace of my forest while you may Its time is passing Tanis glanced sharply at the Forestmaster but the great animal had turned her attention away from him and was staring far off into the woods her eyes clouded with sorrow The halfelf wondered what she meant and he sat lost in dark thoughts until he felt a gentle hand touch his You should eat Goldmoon said Your cares wont vanish with the mealand if they do so much the better Tanis smiled at her and began to eat with a sharp appetite He took the Forestmasters advice and relegated his worries to the back of his mind for a while Goldmoon was right they werent likely to go away The rest of the companions did the same accepting the strangeness of their surroundings with the aplomb of seasoned travelers Though there was nothing to drink but watermuch to Flints disappointmentthe cool clear liquid washed the terrors and doubts from their hearts as it had cleansed the blood and dirt from their hands They laughed talked and ate enjoying each others companionship The Forestmaster spoke to them no more but watched each in turn Sturms pale face had regained some color He ate with grace and dignity Sitting next to Tasslehoff he answered the kenders inexhaustible store of questions about his homeland He also without calling undue attention to the fact removed from Tasslehoffs pouch a knife and fork that had unaccountably made their way there The knight sat as far from Caramon as possible and did his best to ignore him The big warrior was obviously enjoying his meal He ate three times more than anyone else three times as fast and three times as loudly When not eating he described to Flint a fight with a troll using the bone he was chewing on as a sword to illustrate his thrusts and parries Flint ate heartily and told Caramon he was the biggest liar in Krynn Raistlin sitting beside his brother ate very little taking nibbles of only the tenderest meat a few grapes and a bit of bread he soaked in water first He said nothing but listened intently to everyone absorbing all that was said into his soul storing it for future reference and use Goldmoon ate her meal delicately with practised ease The Queshu princess was accustomed to eating in public view and could make conversation easily She chatted with Tanis encouraging him to describe the elven lands and other places he had visited Riverwind next to her was accutely uncomfortable and selfconscious Although not a boisterous eater like Caramon the Plainsman was obviously more accustomed to eating at the campfires of his fellow tribesmen than in royal halls He handled cutlery with awkward clumsiness and he knew that he appeared crude beside Goldmoon He said nothing seeming willing to fade into the background Finally everyone began shoving plates away and settling back in the strange wooden chairs ending their dinner with pieces of sweet shortcake Tas began to sing his kender trailsong to the delight of the centaurs Then suddenly Raistlin spoke His soft whispering voice slithered through the laughter and loud talk Forestmasterthe mage hissed the nametoday we fought loathsome creatures that we have never seen before on Krynn Can you tell us of these The relaxed and festive mood was smothered as effectively as if covered by a shroud Everyone exchanged grim looks These creatures walk like men Caramon added but look like reptiles They have clawed hands and feet and wings andhis voice droppedthey turn to stone when they die The Forestmaster regarded them with sadness as she rose to her feet She seemed to expect the question I know of these creatures she answered Some of them entered the Darken Wood with a party of goblins from Haven a week ago They wore hoods and cloaks no doubt to disguise their horrible appearance The centaurs followed them in secret to make certain they harmed no one before the spectral minions dealt with them The centaurs reported that the creatures call themselves draconians and speak of belonging to the Order of Draco Raistlins brow furrowed Draco he whispered puzzled But who are they What race or species I do not know I can tell you only this they are not of the animal world and they belong to none of the races of Krynn This took a moment for everyone to assimilate Caramon blinked I dont he began She means my brother that they are not of this world Raistlin explained impatiently Then whered they come from Caramon asked startled Thats the question isnt it Raistlin said coldly Where did they come fromand why I cannot answer that The Forestmaster shook her head But I can tell you that before the spectral minions put an end to these draconians they spoke of armies to the north I saw them Tanis rose to his feet Campfires His voice caught in his throat as he realized what the Forestmaster had been about to say Armies Of these draconians There must be thousands Now everyone was standing and talking at once Impossible the knight said scowling Whos behind this The Seekers By the gods Caramon bellowed Ive got a notion to go to Haven and bash Go to Solamnia not to Haven Sturm advised loudly We should travel to Qualinost Tanis argued The elves The elves have their own problems the Forestmaster interrupted her cool voice a calming influence As do the Highseekers of Haven No place is safe But I will tell you where you must go to find answers to your questions What do you mean you will tell us where to go Raistlin stepped forward slowly his red robes rippling around him as he walked What do you know of us The mage paused his eyes narrowing with a sudden thought Yes I was expecting you the Forestmaster replied in answer to Raistlins thoughts A great and shining being appeared to me in the wilderness this day He told me that the one bearing the blue crystal staff would come this night to Darken Wood The spectral minions would let the staffbearer and her companions passthough they have allowed no human or elf or dwarf or kender to enter Darken Wood since the Cataclysm I was to give the bearer of the staff this message You must fly straight away across the Eastwall Mountains In two days the staffbearer must be within Xak Tsaroth There if you prove worthy you shall receive the greatest gift given to the world Eastwall Mountains The dwarfs mouth dropped open Well need to fly all right to reach Xak Tsaroth in two days time Shining being Hah He snapped his fingers The rest glanced uneasily at each other Finally Tanis said hesitantly Im afraid the dwarf is right Forestmaster The journey to Xak Tsaroth would be long and perilous We would have to go back through lands we know are inhabited by goblins and these draconians And then we would have to pass through the Plains Riverwind spoke for the first time since meeting the Forestmaster Our lives are forfeit He gestured toward Goldmoon The Queshu are fierce fighters and they know the land They are waiting We would never get through safely He looked at Tanis And my people have no love for elves And why go to Xak Tsaroth anyway Caramon rumbled Greatest giftwhat could that be A powerful sword A chest of steel coins That would come in handy but theres battle brewing up north apparently Id hate to miss it The Forestmaster nodded gravely I understand yourdilemma she said I offer what help is in my power I will see to it that you reach Xak Tsaroth in two days The question is will you go Tanis turned to the others Sturms face was drawn He met Taniss look and sighed The stag led us here he said slowly perhaps to receive this advice But my heart lies north in my homeland If armies of these draconians are preparing to attack my place is with those Knights who will surely band together to fight this evil Still I do not want to desert you Tanis or you lady He nodded to Goldmoon then slumped down his aching head in his hands Caramon shrugged Ill go anywhere fight anything Tanis You know that What say you brother But Raistlin staring into the darkness did not answer Goldmoon and Riverwind were speaking together in low voices They nodded to each other then Goldmoon said to Tanis We will go to Xak Tsaroth We appreciate everything youve done for us But we ask for no mans help any longer Riverwind stated proudly This is the completion of our quest As we began alone so we will finish it alone And you will die alone Raistlin said softly Tanis shivered Raistlin he said a word with you The mage turned obediently and walked with the halfelf into a small thicket of gnarled and stunted trees Darkness closed around them Just like the old days Caramon said his eyes following hismbrother uneasily And look at all the trouble we got into then Flint reminded him plopping down onto the grass I wonder what they talk about Tasslehoff said Long ago the kender had tried to eavesdrop on these private conversations between the mage and the halfelf but Tanis had always caught him and shooed him away And why cant they discuss it with us Because wed probably rip Raistlins heart out Sturm answered in a low painfilled voice I dont care what you say Caramon theres a dark side to your brother and Tanis has seen it For which Im grateful He can deal with it I couldnt Uncharacteristically Caramon said nothing Sturm stared at the warrior startled In the old days the fighter would have leaped to his brothers defense Now he sat silent preoccupied his face troubled So there is a dark side to Raistlin and now Caramon too knows what it is Sturm shuddered wondering what had happened in these past five years that cast such a dark shadow across the cheerful warrior Raistlin walked close to Tanis The mages arms were crossed in the sleeves of his robes his head bowed in thought Tanis could feel the heat of Raistlins body radiate through the red robes as though he were being consumed by an inner fire As usual Tanis felt uncomfortable in the young mages presence Yet right now he knew of no one else he could turn to for advice What do you know of Xak Tsaroth Tanis asked There was a temple therea temple to the ancient gods Raistlin whispered His eyes glittered in the eerie light of the red moon It was destroyed in the Cataclysm and its people fled certain that the gods had abandoned them It passed from memory I did not know it still existed What did you see Raistlin Tanis asked softly after a long pause You looked far awaywhat did you see I am magi Tanis not a seer Dont give me that Tanis snapped Its been a long time but not that long I know you dont have the gift of foresight You were thinking not scrying And you came up with answers I want those answers Youve got more brains than all of us put together even if he stopped Even if I am twisted and warped Raistlins voice rose with harsh arrogance Yes I am smarter than youall of you And someday I will prove it Someday youwith all your strength and charm and good looksyouall of you will call me master His hands clenched to fists inside his robes his eyes flared red in the crimson moonlight Tanis who was accustomed to this tirade waited patiently The mage relaxed his hands unclenched But for now I give you my advice What did I see These armies Tanis armies of draconians will overrun Solace and Haven and all the lands of your fathers That is the reason we must reach Xak Tsaroth What we find there will prove this armys undoing But why are there armies Tanis asked What would anyone want with control of Solace and Haven and the Plains to the east Is it the Seekers Seekers Hah Raistlin snorted Open your eyes HalfElf Someone or something powerful created these creaturesthese draconians Not the idiot Seekers And no one goes to all that trouble to take over two farm cities or even to look for a blue crystal staff This is a war of conquest Tanis Someone seeks to conquer Ansalon Within two days time life on Krynn as we have known it will come to an end This is the portent of the fallen stars The Queen of Darkness has returned We face a foe who seeksat the very leastto enslave us or perhaps destroy us completely Your advice Tanis asked reluctantly He felt change coming and like all elves he feared and detested change Raistlin smiled his crooked bitter smile reveling in his moment of superiority That we go to Xak Tsaroth immediately That we leave tonight if possible by whatever means this Forestmaster has planned If we do not acquire this gift within two daysthe armies of draconians will What do you think the gift might be Tanis wondered aloud A sword or coins like Caramon said My brothers a fool Raistlin stated coldly You dont believe that and neither do I Then what Tanis pursued Raistlins eyes narrowed I have given you my advice Act upon it as you will I have my own reasons for going Let us leave it at that HalfElf But it will be dangerous Xak Tsaroth was abandoned three hundred years ago I do not think it will have remained abandoned long That is true Tanis mused He stood silently for long moments The mage coughed once softly Do you believe we were chosen Raistlin Tanis asked The mage did not hesitate Yes So I was given to know in the Towers of Sorcery So ParSalian told me But why Tanis questioned impatiently We are not the stuff of heroeswell maybe Sturm Ah said Raistlin But who chose us And for what purpose Consider that Tanis HalfElven The mage bowed to Tanis mockingly and turned to walk back through the brush to the rest of the group Winged sleep Smoke in the east Dark memories Xak Tsaroth Tanis said That is my decision Is that what the mage advises Sturm asked sullenly It is Tanis answered and I believe his advice is sound If we do not reach Xak Tsaroth within two days others will and this greatest gift may be lost forever The greatest gift Tasslehoff said his eyes shining Just think Flint Jewels beyond price Or maybe A keg of ale and Otiks fried potatoes the dwarf muttered And a nice warm fire But noXak Tsaroth I guess were all in agreement then Tanis said If you feel you are needed in the north Sturm of course you I will go with you to Xak Tsaroth Sturm sighed There is nothing in the north for me I have been deluding myself The Knights of my order are scattered holed up in crumbling fortresses fighting off the debt collectors The knights face twisted in agony and he lowered his head Tanis suddenly felt tired His neck hurt his shoulders and back ached his leg muscles twitched He started to say something more then felt a gentle hand touch his shoulder He looked up to see Goldmoons face cool and calm in the moonlight You are weary my friend she said We all are But we are glad you are coming Riverwind and I Her hand was strong She looked up her clear gaze encompassing the entire group We are glad all of you are coming with us Tanis glancing at Riverwind wasnt certain the tall Plainsman agreed with her Just another adventure Caramon said flushing with embarrassment Eh Raist He nudged his brother Raistlin ignoring his twin looked at the Forestmaster We must leave immediately the mage said coldly You mentioned something about helping us cross the mountains Indeed the Forestmaster replied nodding gravely I too am glad you have made this decision I hope you find my aid welcome The Forestmaster raised her head looking up into the sky The companions followed her gaze The night sky seen through the canopy of tall trees glittered brilliantly with stars Soon the companions became aware of something flying up there winking out the stars in passing Ill be a gully dwarf Flint said solemnly Flying horses What next Oh Tasslehoff drew in a deep breath The kender was transfixed with wonder as he watched the beautiful animals circle above them descending lower and lower with each turn their fur radiating bluewhite in the moonlight Tas clasped his hands together Never in his wildest kender imaginings had he dreamed of flying This was worth fighting all the draconians on Krynn The pegasi dipped to the ground their feathery wings creating a wind that tossed the tree branches and laid the grass flat A large pegasus with wings that touched the ground when he walked bowed reverently to the Forest Master His bearing was proud and noble Each of the other beautiful creatures bowed in turn You have summoned us the leader asked the Forestmaster These guests of mine have urgent business to the east I bid you bear them with the swiftness of the winds across the Eastwall Mountains The pegasus regarded the companions with astonishment He walked with stately mein over to stare first at one then another When Tas raised his hand to pet the steeds nose both of the animals ears swiveled forward and he reared his great head back But when he got to Flint he snorted in disgust and turned to the Forestmaster A kender Humans And a dwarf Dont do me any favors horse Flint sneezed The Forestmaster merely nodded and smiled The pegasus bowed in reluctant assent Very well master he replied With powerful grace he walked over to Goldmoon and started to bend his foreleg dipping low before her to assist her in mounting No do not kneel noble animal she said I have ridden horses since before I could walk I need no such assistance Handing Riverwind her staff Goldmoon threw her arm around the Pegasuss neck and pulled herself astride his broad back Her silvergold hair blew feathery white in the moonlight her face was pure and cold as marble Now she truly looked like the princess of a barbarian tribe She took her staff from Riverwind Raising it in the air she lifted her voice in song Riverwind his eyes shining with admiration leaped up behind her on the back of the winged horse Putting his arms around her he added his deep baritone voice to hers Tanis had no idea what they were singing but it seemed a song of victory and triumph It stirred his blood and he would have willingly joined in One of the pegasi cantered up to him He pulled himself up and settled himself on his broad back sitting in front of the powerful wings Now all the companions caught up in the elation of the moment mounted Goldmoons song adding wings to their souls as the pegasi spread their huge wings and caught the wind currents They soared higher and higher circling above the forest The silver moon and the red bathed the valley below and the clouds above in an eerie beautiful purplish glow that receded into a deeper purple night As the forest fell away from them the last thing the companions saw was the Forestmaster glimmering like a star fallen from the heavens shining lost and alone in a darkening land One by one the companions felt drowsiness overcome them Tasslehoff fought this magically induced sleep longest Enchanted by the rush of wind against his face spellbound by the sight of the tall trees that normally loomed over him reduced to childs toys Tas struggled to remain awake long after everyone else Flints head rested against his back the dwarf snoring loudly Goldmoon was cradled in Riverwinds arms His head drooped over her shoulder Even in his sleep he held her protectively Caramon slumped over his horses neck breathing stentoriously His brother rested against his twins broad back Sturm slept peacefully the lines of pain gone from his face Even Taniss bearded face was clear of care and worry and responsibility Tas yawned No he mumbled blinking rapidly and pinching himself Rest now little kender his pegasus said in amusement Mortals were not meant to fly This sleep is for your protection We do not want you to panic and fall off I wont Tas protested yawning again His head sank forward The pegasuss neck was warm and comfortable the fur was fragrant and soft I wont panic Tas whispered sleepily Never panic He slept The halfelf woke with a start to find that he was lying in a grassy meadow The leader of the pegasi stood above him staring off to the east Tanis sat up Where are we he began This isnt a city He looked around Whywe havent even crossed the Mountains yet I am sorry The pegasus turned to him We could not take you as far as the Eastwall Mountains There is great trouble brewing in the east A darkness fills the air such a darkness as I have not felt in Krynn for countless He stopped lowered his head and pawed the ground restlessly I dare not travel farther Where are we the confused halfelf repeated And where are the other pegasi I sent them home I remained to guard your sleep Now that you are awake I must return home as well The pegasus gazed sternly at Tanis I know not what awakened this great evil on Krynn I trust it was not you and your companions He spread his great wings Wait Tanis scrambled to his feet What The pegasus leaped into the air circled twice then was gone flying rapidly back to the west What evil Tanis asked glumly He sighed and looked around His companions were sleeping soundly lying on the ground around him in various poses of slumber He studied the horizon trying to get his bearings It was nearly dawn he realized The suns light was just beginning to illuminate the east He was standing on a flat prairie There was not a tree in sight nothing but rolling fields of tall grass as far as he could see Wondering what the pegasus had meant about trouble to the east Tanis sat down to watch the sun rise and wait for his friends to wake He wasnt particularly worried about where he was for he guessed Riverwind knew this land down to the last blade of grass So he stretched out on the ground facing the east feeling more relaxed after that strange sleep than he had in many nights Suddenly he sat upright his relaxed feeling gone a tightness clutching at his throat like an unseen hand For there snaking up to meet the bright new morning sun were three thick twisting columns of greasy black smoke Tanis stumbled to his feet He ran over and shook Riverwind gently trying to wake the Plainsman without disturbing Goldmoon Hush Tanis whispered putting a warning finger on his lips and nodding toward the sleeping woman as Riverwind blinked at the halfelf Seeing Taniss dark expression the barbarian was instantly awake He stood up quietly and moved off with Tanis glancing around him Whats this he whispered Were in the Plains of Abanasinia Still about a half days journey from the Eastwall Mountains My village lies to the east He stopped as Tanis pointed silently eastward Then he gave a shallow ragged cry as he saw the smoke curling into the sky Goldmoon jerked awake She sat up gazed at Riverwind sleepily then with growing alarm Turning she followed his horrified stare No she moaned No she cried again Quickly rising she began to gather their possessions The others woke at her cry What is it Caramon jumped up Their village Tanis said softly gesturing with his hand Its burning Apparently the armies are moving quicker than we thought No said Raistlin Rememberthe draconian clerics mentioned they had traced the staff to a village in the Plains My people Goldmoon murmured energy draining from her She slumped in Riverwinds arms staring at the smoke My father We better get going Caramon glanced around uneasily We show up like a jewel in a gypsy dancers navel Yes Tanis said Weve definitely got to get out of here But where do we go he asked Riverwind Queshu Goldmoons tone allowed no contraction Its on our way The Eastwall Mountains are just beyond my village She started through the tall grass Tanis glanced at Riverwind Marulinar the Plainsman called out to her Running forward he caught hold of Goldmoons arm Nikh pattakh merilar he said sternly She stared up at him her eyes blue and cold as the morning sky No she said resolutely I am going to our village It is our fault if something has happened I dont care if there are thousands of those monsters waiting I will die with our people as I should have done Her voice failed her Tanis watching felt his heart ache with pity Riverwind put his arm around her and together they began walking toward the rising sun Caramon cleared his throat I hope I do meet a thousand of those things he muttered hoisting his and his brothers packs Hey he said in astonishment Theyre full He peered in his pack Provisions Several days worth And my swords back in my scabbard At least thats one thing we wont have to worry about Tanis said grimly You all right Sturm Yes the knight answered I feel much better after that sleep Right then Lets go Flint wheres Tas Turning Tanis nearly fell over the kender who had been standing right behind him Poor Goldmoon Tas said softly Tanis patted him on the shoulder Maybe it wont be as bad as we fear the halfelf said following the Plainsmen through the rippling grass Maybe the warriors fought them off and those are victory fires Tasslehoff sighed and looked up at Tanis his brown eyes wide Youre a rotten liar Tanis the kender said He had the feeling it was going to be a very long day Twilight The pale sun set Shafts of yellow and tan streaked the western sky then faded into dreary night The companions sat huddled around a fire that offered no warmth for there existed no flame on Krynn that would drive the chill from their souls They did not speak to each other but each sat staring into the fire trying to make some sense of what they had seen trying to make sense of the senseless Tanis had lived through much that was horrible in his life But the ravaged town of Queshu would always stand out in his mind as a symbol of the horrors of war Even so remembering Queshu he could only grasp fleeting images his mind refusing to encompass the total awful vision Oddly enough he remembered the melted stones of Queshu He remembered them vividly Only in his dreams did he recall the twisted and blackened bodies that lay among the smoking stones The great stone walls the huge stone temples and edifices the spacious stone buildings with their rock courtyards and statuary the large stone arenaall had melted like butter on a hot summer day The rock still smoldered though it was obvious that the village must have been attacked well over a sunrise ago It was as if a whitehot searing flame had engulfed the entire village But what fire was there on Krynn that could melt rock He remembered a creaking sound remembered hearing it and being puzzled by it and wondering what it was until locating the source of the only sound in the deathly still town became an obsession He ran through the ruined village until he located the source He remembered that he shouted to the others until they came They stood staring into the melted arena Huge stone blocks had poured down from the side of the bowlshaped depression forming molten ripples of rock around the bottom of the dish In the centeron grass that was blackened and charredstood a crude gibbet Two stout posts had been driven into the burned ground by unspeakable force their bases splintered by the impact Ten feet above the ground a crosspiece pole was lashed to the two posts The wood was charred and blistered Scavenger birds perched on the top Three chains made of what appeared to be iron before it had melted and run togther swung back and forth This was the cause of the creaking sound Suspended from each chain apparently by the feet was a corpse The corpses were not human they were hobgoblin On top of the gruesome structure was a shield stuck to the crosspiece with a broken swordblade Roughly clawed on the battered shield were words written in a crude form of Common This is what happens to those who take prisoners against my commands Kill or be killed It was signed Verminaard Verminaard The name meant nothing to Tanis Other images He remembered Goldmoon standing in the center of her fathers ruined house trying to put back together the pieces of a broken vase He remembered a dogthe only living thing they found in the entire villagecurled around the body of a dead child Caramon stopped to pet the small dog The animal cringed then licked the big mans hand It then licked the childs cold face looking up at the warrior hopefully expecting this human to make everything all right to make his little playmate run and laugh again He remembered Caramon stroking the dogs soft fur with his huge hands He remembered Riverwind picking up a rock holding it aimlessly as he stared around his burned and blasted village He remembered Sturm standing transfixed before the gibbet staring at the sign and he remembered the knights lips moving as though in prayer or perhaps a silent vow He remembered the sorrowlined face of the dwarf who had seen so much tragedy in his long lifetime as he stood in the center of the ruined village patting Tasslehoff gently on the back after finding the kender sobbing in a corner He remembered Goldmoons frantic search for survivors She crawled through the blackened rubble screaming out names listening for faint answers to her calls until she was hoarse and Riverwind finally convinced her it was hopeless If there were any survivors they had long since fled He remembered standing alone in the center of the town looking at piles of dust with arrowheads in them and recognizing them as bodies of draconians He remembered a cold hand touching his arm and the mages whispering voice Tanis we must leave There is nothing more we can do and we must reach Xak Tsaroth Then we will have our revenge And so they left Queshu They traveled far into the night none of them wanting to stop each wanting to push his body to the point of exhaustion so that when they finally slept there would be no evil dreams But the dreams came anyway Chill dawn Vine bridges Dark water Tanis felt clawed hands clutching at his throat He struggled and fought then woke to find Riverwind bending over him in the darkness shaking him roughly What Tanis sat up You were dreaming the Plainsman said grimly I had to wake you Your shouts would draw an army down on us Yes thanks Tanis muttered Im sorry He sat up trying to shake off the nightmare What time is it Still several hours till dawn Riverwind said wearily He returned to where he had been sitting his back against the trunk of a twisted tree Goldmoon lay sleeping on the ground beside him She began to murmur and shake her head making small soft moaning cries like a wounded animal Riverwind stroked her silvergold hair and she quieted You should have wakened me earlier Tanis said He stood up rubbing his shoulders and neck Its my watch Do you think I could sleep asked Riverwind bitterly Youve got to Tanis answered Youll slow us up if you dont The men in my tribe can travel for many days without sleep Riverwind said His eyes were dull and glazed and he seemed to stare at nothing Tanis started to argue then sighed and kept quiet He knew that he could never truly understand the agony the Plainsman was suffering To have friends and familyan entire lifeutterly destroyed must be so devastating that the mind shrank from even imagining it Tanis left him and walked over to where Flint was sitting carving at a piece of wood You might as well get some sleep Tanis told the dwarf Ill watch for a while Flint nodded I heard you yelling over there He sheathed his dagger and thrust the piece of wood into a pouch Defending Queshu Tanis frowned at the memory Shivering in the chill night he wrapped his cloak around him drew up his hood Any idea where we are he asked Flint The Plainsman says were on a road known as Sageway East the dwarf answered He stretched out on the cold ground dragging a blanket up around his shoulders Some old highway Its been around since before the Cataclysm I dont suppose wed be fortunate enough to have this road take us into Xak Tsaroth Riverwind doesnt seem to think so the dwarf mumbled sleepily Says hes only followed it a short distance But at least it gets us through the mountains He gave a great yawn and turned over pillowing his head on his cloak Tanis breathed deeply The night seemed peaceful enough They hadnt run into any draconians or goblins in their wild flight from Queshu As Raistlin said apparently the draconians had attacked Queshu in search of the staff not as part of any preparations for battle They had struck and then withdrawn The Forestmasters time limit still held good Tanis supposedXak Tsaroth within two days And one day had already passed Shivering the halfelf walked back over to Riverwind Do you have any idea how far we have to go and in what direction Tanis crouched down next to the Plainsman Yes Riverwind nodded rubbing his burning eyes We must go to the northeast toward Newsea That is where the city is rumored to be I have never been there He frowned then shook his head Ive never been there he repeated Can we reach it by tomorrow Tanis asked Newsea is said to be two days journey from Queshu The barbarian sighed If Tak Tsaroth exists we should be able to reach it in a day though I have heard that the land from here to Newsea is swampy and difficult to travel He shut his eyes his hand absently stroking Goldmoons hair Tanis fell silent hoping the Plainsman would sleep The halfelf moved quietly to sit beneath the tree staring into the night He made a mental note to ask Tasslehoff in the morning if he had a map The kender did have a map but it wasnt much help dating as it did before the Cataclysm Newsea wasnt on the map since it had appeared after the land had been torn apart and the waters of Turbidus Ocean had rushed in to fill it Still the map showed Xak Tsaroth only a short distance from the highway marked Sageway East They should reach it some time that afternoon if the territory they had to cross wasnt impassable The companions ate a cheerless breakfast most forcing the food down without appetite Raistlin brewed his foulsmelling herbal drink over the small fire his strange eyes lingering on Goldmoons staff How precious it has become he commented softly now that it has been purchased by the blood of innocents Is it worth it Is it worth the lives of my people Goldmoon asked staring at the nondescript brown staff dully She seemed to have aged during the night Gray circles smudged the skin beneath her eyes None of the companions answered each looking away in awkward silence Riverwind stood up abruptly and stalked off into the woods by himself Goldmoon lifted her eyes and stared after him then her head sank into her hand and she began to weep silently He blames himself She shook her head And I am not helping him It wasnt his fault Its not anyones fault Tanis said slowly walking over to her He put his hand on her shoulder rubbing out the tenseness he felt in the bunched muscles of her neck We cant understand Weve just got to keep going and hope we find the answer in Xak Tsaroth She nodded and wiped her eyes drew a deep breath and blew her nose on a handkerchief Tasslehoff handed her Youre right she said swallowing My father would be ashamed of me I must rememberI am Chieftains Daughter No came Riverwinds deep voice from where he stood behind her in the shadows of the trees You are Chieftain Goldmoon gasped She twisted to her feet to stare wideeyed at Riverwind Perhaps I am she faltered but it is meaningless Our people are dead I saw tracks Riverwind answered Some managed to flee They have probably gone into the mountains They will return and you will be their ruler Our people still alive Goldmoons face became radiant Not many Maybe none now It would depend on whether or not the draconians followed them into the mountains Riverwind shrugged Still you are now their ruler bitterness crept into his voiceand I will be husband of Chieftain Goldmoon cringed as though he had struck her She blinked then shook her head No Riverwind she said softly I weve talked Have we he interrupted I was thinking about it last night Ive been gone so many years My thoughts were of youas a woman I did not realizeHe swallowed and then drew a deep breath I left Goldmoon I returned to find Chieftains Daughter What choice did I have Goldmoon cried angrily My father wasnt well I had to rule or Loreman would have taken over the tribe Do you know whats it likebeing Chieftains Daughter Wondering at every meal if this morsel is the one with the poison Struggling every day to find the money in the treasury to pay the soldiers so that foreman would have no excuse to take over And all the time I must act as Chieftains Daughter while my father sits and drools and mumbles Her voice choked with tears Riverwind listened his face stern and unmoving He stared at a point above her head We should get started he said coldly Its nearly dawn The companions had traveled only a few miles on the old broken road when it dumped them literally into a swamp They had noticed that the ground was getting spongier and the tall sturdy trees of the mountain canyon forests dwindled Strange twisted trees rose up before them A miasma blotted out the sun and the air became foul to breathe Raistlin began to cough and he covered his mouth with a handkerchief They stayed on the broken stones of the old road avoiding the dank swampy ground next to it Flint was walking in front with Tasslehoff when suddenly the dwarf gave a great shout and disappeared into the muck They could see only his head Help The dwarf Tas shouted and the others ran up Its dragging me under Flint flailed about the black oozing mud in panic Hold still Riverwind cautioned You have fallen in deathmirk Dont go in after him he warned Sturm who had leaped forward Youll both die Get a branch Caramon grabbed a young sapling took a deep breath grunted and pulled They could hear its roots snapping and creaking as the huge warrior dragged it out of the ground Riverwind stretched out flat extending the branch to the dwarf Flint nearly up to his nose in the slimy muck thrashed about and finally grabbed hold of it The warrior hauled the tree out of the deathmirk the dwarf clinging to it Tanis The kender clutched at the halfelf and pointed A snake as big around as Caramons arm slithered into the ooze right where the dwarf had been floundering We cant walk through this Tanis gestured at the swamp Maybe we should turn back No time Raistlin whispered his hourglass eyes glittering And there is no other way Riverwind said His voice sounded strange And we can get throughI know a path What Tanis turned to him I thought you said Ive been here the Plainsman said in a strangled voice I cant remember when but Ive been here I know the way through the swamp And it leads to He licked his lips Leads to a broken city of evil Tanis asked grimly when the Plainsman did not finish his sentence Xak Tsaroth Raistlin hissed Of course Tanis said softly It makes sense Where would we go to find answers about the staffexcept to the place where the staff was given you And we must go now said Raistlin insistently We must be there by midnight tonight The Plainsman took the lead He found firm ground around the black water and making them all walk single file led them away from the road and deeper into the swamp Trees that he called ironclaw rose out of the water their roots standing exposed twisting into the mud Vines drooped from their branches and trailed across the faint path The mist closed in and soon no one could see beyond a few feet They were forced to move slowly testing every step A false move and they would have plunged into the stinking morass that lay foul and stagnant all around them Suddenly the trail came to an end in dark swamp water Now what Caramon asked gloomily This Riverwind said pointing A crude bridge made out of vines twisted into ropes was attached to a tree It spanned the water like a spider web Who built it Tanis asked I dont know Riverwind said But you will find them all along the path wherever it becomes impassable I told you Xak Tsaroth would not remain abandoned Raistlin whispered Yes wellI suppose we shouldnt throw stones at a gift of the gods replied Tanis At least we dont have to swim The journey across the vine bridge was not pleasant The vines were coated with slimy moss which made walking precarious The structure swayed alarmingly when touched and its motion became erratic when anyone crossed They made it safely to the other side but had walked only a short distance before they were forced to use another bridge And always below them and around them was the dark water where strange eyes watched them hungrily Then they reached a point where the firm ground ended and there were no vine bridges Ahead was nothing but slimy water It isnt very deep Riverwind muttered Follow me Step only where I step Riverwind took a step then another step feeling his way the rest keeping right behind him staring into the water They stared in disgust and alarm as unknown and unseen things slithered past their legs When they reached firm ground again their legs were coated with slime all of them gagged from the smell But this last journey seemed perhaps to have been the worst The jungle growth was not as thick and they could even seen the sun shining faintly through a green haze The farther north they traveled the firmer the terrain became By midday Tanis called a halt when he found a dry patch of ground beneath an ancient oak tree The companions sank down to eat lunch and speak hopefully of leaving the swamp behind them All except Goldmoon and Riverwind They spoke not at all Flints clothes were sopping wet He shook with the cold and began complaining about pains in his joints Tanis grew worried He knew the dwarf was subject to rheumatism and remembered what Flint had said about fearing to slow them up Tanis tapped the kender and gestured him over to one side I know youve got something in one of your pouches that would take the chill off the dwarfs bones if you know what I mean Tanis said softly Oh sure Tanis Tas said brightening He fumbled around first in one pouch then another and finally came up with a gleaming silver flask Brandy Otiks finest I dont suppose you paid for it Tanis asked grinning I will the kender replied hurt Next time Im there Sure Tanis patted him on the shoulder Share some with Flint Not too much he cautioned Just warm him up All right And well take the leadwe mighty warriors Tas returned to the others They were silently packing up the remains of lunch and preparing to move out All of us could use some of Otiks finest he thought Goldmoon and Riverwind had not spoken to each other all morning Their mood spread a pall on everyone Tanis could think of nothing to do that would end the torture these two were experiencing He could only hope that time would salve the wounds The companions continued along the trail for about an hour after lunch moving more quickly since the thickest part of the jungle had been left behind Just as they thought they had left the swamp however the firm ground came abruptly to an end Weary sick with the smell and discouraged the companions found themselves wading through the muck once again Only Flint and Tasslehoff were unaffected by the return to the swamp These two had ranged far ahead of the others Tasslehoff soon forgot Taniss warning about drinking only a little of the brandy The liquid warmed the blood and took the edge off the gloomy atmosphere so the kender and dwarf passed the flask back and forth many times until it was empty and they were traipsing along making jokes about what they would do if they encountered a draconian Id turn it to stone all right the dwarf said swinging an imaginary battleaxe Whamright in the lizards gizzard Ill bet Raistlin could turn one to stone with a look Tas imitated the mages grim face and dour stare They both laughed loudly then hushed giggling peering back unsteadily to see if Tanis had heard them Ill bet Caramond stick a fork in one and eat it Flint said Tas choked with laughter and wiped tears from his eyes The dwarf roared Suddenly the two came to the end of the spongy ground Tasslehoff grabbed hold of the dwarf as Flint nearly plunged headfirst into a pool of swamp water so wide that a vine bridge would not span it A huge ironclaw tree lay across the water its thick trunk making a bridge wide enough for two people to walk across sidebyside Now this is a bridge Flint said stepping back a pace and trying to bring the log into focus No more spider crawling on those stupid green webs Lets go Shouldnt we wait for the others Tasslehoff asked mildly Tanis wouldnt want to us to get separated Tanis Humpf The dwarf sniffed Well show him All right Tasslehoff agreed cheerfully He leaped up onto the fallen tree Careful he said slipping slightly then easily catching his balance Its slick He took a few quick steps arms outstretched his feet pointed out like a rope walker hed seen once at a summer fair The dwarf clambered up after the kender Flints thick boots clumping clumsily on the log A voice in the unbrandied part of Flints mind told him he could never have done this cold sober It also told him he was a fool for crossing the bridge without waiting for the others but he ignored it He was feeling positively young again Tasslehoff enchanted with pretending he was Mirgo the Magnificent looked up and discovered that he did indeed have an audience one of those draconian things leaped onto the log in front of him The sight sobered Tas up rapidly The kender was not given to fear but he was certainly amazed He had presence of mind enough to do two things First he yelled out loudly Tanis ambush Then he lifted his hoopak staff and swung it in a wide arc The move took the draconian by surprise The creature sucked in its breath and jumped back off the log to the bank below Tas momentarily off balance regained his feet quickly and wondered what to do next He glanced around and saw another draconian on the bank They were he was puzzled to notice not armed Before he could consider this oddity he heard a roar behind him He had forgotten the dwarf What is it Flint shouted Dracothingamajiggers Tas said gripping his hoopak and peering through the mists Two ahead Here they come Well confound it get out of my way Flint snarled Reaching behind he fumbled for his axe Where am I supposed to go Tas shouted wildly Duck yelled the dwarf The kender ducked throwing himself down on the log as one of the draconians came toward him its clawed hands outstretched Flint swung his axe in a mighty blow that would have decapitated the draconian if it had come anywhere near it Unfortunately the dwarf miscalculated and the blade whistied harmlessly in front of the draconian who was waving its hands in the air and chanting strange words The momentum of Flints swing spun the dwarf around His feet slipped on the slimy log and with a loud cry the dwarf tumbled backwards into the water Tasslehoff having been around Raistlin for years recognized that the draconian was casting a magic spell Lying face down on the log his hoopak staff clutched in his hand the kender figured he had about one and a half seconds to consider what to do The dwarf was gasping and spluttering in the water beneath him Not inches away the draconian was clearly reaching a stunning conclusion to his spellcasting Deciding that anything was better than being magicked Tas took a deep breath and dove off the log Tanis Ambush Damn swore Caramon as the kenders voice floated to them out of the mist somewhere ahead They all began running toward the sound cursing the vines and the tree branches that blocked their way Crashing out through the forest they saw the fallen ironclaw bridge Four draconians ran out of the shadows blocking their path Suddenly the companions were plunged into darkness too thick to see their own hands much less their comrades Magic Tanis heard Raistlin hiss These are magicusers Stand aside You cannot fight them Then Tanis heard the mage cry out in agony Raist Caramon shouted Whereugh There was a groan and the sound of a heavy body thudding to the ground Tanis heard the draconians chanting Even as he fumbled for his sword he was suddenly covered head to toe in a thick gooey substance that clogged up his nose and mouth Struggling to free himself he only enmeshed himself further He heard Sturm swearing next to him Goldmoon cried out Riverwinds voice was choked off then drowsiness overcame him Tanis sank to his knees still fighting to free himself from the weblike substance that glued his hands to his sides Then he fell forward on his face and sank into an unnatural sleep Prisoners of the draconians Laying on the ground panting for breath Tasslehoff watched as the draconians prepared to carry off his unconscious friends The kender was wellhidden beneath a bush near the swamp The dwarf was stretched out next to him knocked out cold Tas glanced at him in remorse Hed had no choice In his panic Flint had dragged the kender down in the cold water If he hadnt clunked the dwarf over the head with his hoopak staff neither of them would have surfaced alive Hed hauled the comatose dwarf up out of the water and hidden him beneath a bush Then Tasslehoff watched helplessly as the draconians bound his friends magically in what looked like strong spider webs Tas saw they were all apparently unconsciousor dead because they didnt struggle or put up a fight The kender did get a certain amount of grim amusement out of watching the draconians try to pick up Goldmoons staff Evidently they recognized it for they croaked over it in their gutteral language and made gestures of glee Onepresumably the leaderreached out to grasp it There was a flash of blue light Giving a screeching cry the draconian dropped the staff and hopped up and down on the bank uttering words Tas assumed were impolite The leader finally came up with an ingenious idea Pulling a fur blanket from Goldmoons pack the draconian laid it down on the ground The creature picked up a stick and used it to roll the staff onto the blanket Then it gingerly wrapped the staff in the fur and lifted it up triumphantly The draconians lifted the webbed bodies of the kenders friends and bore them away Other draconians followed behind carrying the companions packs and their weapons As the draconians marched along a path very near the hidden kender Flint suddenly groaned and stirred Tas clamped his hand over the dwarfs mouth The draconians didnt seem to hear and kept moving Tas could see his friends clearly in the fading afternoon light as the draconians passed They seemed to be sound asleep Caramon was even snoring The kender remembered Raistlins sleep spell and figured that was what the draconians had used on his friends Flint groaned again One of the draconians near the end of the line stopped and peered into the brush Tas picked up his hoopak and held it over the dwarfs headjust in case But it wasnt needed The draconian shrugged and muttered to itself then hurried to catch up with its squad Sighing in relief Tas took his hand off the dwarfs mouth Flint blinked and opened his eyes What happened The dwarf moaned his hand on his head You fell off the bridge and hit your head on a log Tas said glibly I did Flint looked suspicious I dont remember that I remember one of those draconian things coming at me and I remember falling into the water Well you did so dont argue Tas said hurriedly getting to his feet Can you walk Of course I can walk the dwarf snapped He stood up a little wobbly but erect Where is everybody The draconians captured them and carried them off All of them Flints mouth fell open Just like that These draconians were magicusers Tas said impatiently anxious to get started They cast spells I guess They didnt hurt them except for Raistlin I think they did something terrible to him I saw him as they passed He looked awful But hes the only one The kender tugged on the dwarfs wet sleeve Lets goweve got to follow them Yeah sure Flint mumbled looking around Then he put his hand on head again Wheres my helm At the bottom of the swamp Tas said in exasperation Do you want to go in after it The dwarf gave the murky water a horrified glance shivered and turned away hurriedly He put his hand to his head again and felt a large bump I sure dont remember hitting my head he muttered Then a sudden thought struck him He felt around his back wildly My axe he cried Hush Tas scolded At least youre alive Now weve got to rescue the others And how do you propose to do that without any weapons except that overgrown slingshot Flint grumbled stumping along after the fastmoving kender Well think of something Tas said confidently though he felt as if his heart were getting tangled up his feet it had sunk so low The kender picked up the draconians trail without any trouble It was obviously an old and wellused trail it looked as though hundreds of draconian feet had tramped along it Tasslehoff examining the tracks suddenly realized that they might be walking into a large camp of the monsters He shrugged No use worrying about such minor details Unfortunately Flint didnt share the same philosophy Theres a whole damn army up there the dwarf gasped grabbing the kender by the shoulder Yes well Tas paused to consider the situation He brightened Thats all the better The more of them there are the less chance theyll have of seeing us He started off again Flint frowned There was something wrong with that logic but right now he couldnt figure out what and he was too wet and chilled to argue Besides he was thinking the same thing the kender was the only other choice they had was to escape into the swamp themselves and leave their friends in the hands of the draconians And that was no choice at all They walked another half hour The sun sank into the mist giving it a bloodred tinge and night fell swiftly in the mirky swamp Soon they saw a blazing light ahead of them They left the trail and sneaked into the brush The kender moved silently as a mouse the dwarf stepped on sticks that snapped beneath his feet ran into trees and blundered through the brush Fortunately the draconian camp was celebrating and probably wouldnt have heard an army of dwarves approaching Flint and Tas knelt just beyond the firelight and watched The dwarf suddenly grabbed the kender with such violence that he nearly pulled him over Great Reorx Flint swore pointing A dragon Tas was too stunned to say anything He and the dwarf watched in amazed horror as the draconians danced and prostrated themselves before a giant black dragon The creature lurked inside the remaining half shell of a crumbled domed ruin Its head was higher than the treetops its wings span was enormous One of the draconians wearing robes bent before the dragon gesturing to the staff as it lay on the ground with the captured weapons Theres something strange about that dragon Tas whispered after watching for a few moments Like theyre not supposed to exist Thats just the point Tas said Look at it The creature isnt moving or reacting to anything Its just sitting there I always thought that dragons would be more lively dont you know Go up and tickle its foot Flint snorted Then youll see lively I think Ill do that the kender said Before the dwarf could say a word Tasslehoff crept out of the brush flitting from shadow to shadow as he drew near the camp Flint could have torn his beard out in frustration but it would have been disastrous to try and stop him now The dwarf could do nothing but follow Tanis The halfelf heard someone calling him from across a huge chasm He tried to answer but his mouth was stuffed with something sticky He shook his head Then he felt an arm around his shoulders helping him sit up He opened his eyes It was night Judging by the flickering light a huge fire blazed brightly somewhere Sturms face looking concerned was near his Tanis sighed and reached out his hand to clasp the knights shoulder He tried to speak and was forced to pull off bits of the sticky substance that clung to his face and mouth like cobwebs Im all right Tanis said when he could talk Where are we He glanced around Is everyone here Anyone hurt Were in a draconian camp Sturm said helping the halfelf stand Tasslehoff and Flint are missing and Raistlins hurt Badly Tanis asked alarmed by the serious expression on Sturms face Not good the knight replied Poisoned dart Riverwind said Tanis turned toward the Plainsman and got his first clear look at their prison They were inside a cage made of bamboo Draconian guards stood outside their long curved swords drawn and ready Beyond the cage hundreds of draconians milled around a campfire And above the campfire Yes Sturm said seeing Taniss startled expression A dragon More childrens stories Raistlin would gloat Raistlin Tanis went over to the mage who was lying in a corner of the cage covered in his cloak The young mage was feverish and shaking with chills Goldmoon knelt beside him her hand on his forehead stroking back the white hair He was unconscious His head tossed fitfully and he murmured strange words sometimes shouting out garbled commands Caramon his face nearly as pale as his brothers sat beside him Goldmoon met Taniss questioning gaze and shook her head sadly her eyes large and gleaming in the reflected firelight Riverwind came over to stand beside Tanis She found this in his neck he said carefully holding up a feathered dart between thumb and forefinger He glanced at the mage without love but with a certain amount of pity Who can say what poison burns in his blood If we had the staff Goldmoon said Right Tanis said Where is it There Sturm said his mouth twisting wryly He pointed Tanis peered past hundreds of draconians and saw the staff lying on Goldmoons fur blanket in front of the black dragon Reaching out Tanis grasped a bar of the cage We could break out he told Sturm Caramon could snap this like a twig Tasslehoff could snap it like a twig if he were here Sturm said Of course then weve only got a few hundred of these creatures to take care ofnot to mention the dragon All right Dont rub it in Tanis sighed Any idea what happened to Flint and Tas Riverwind said he heard a splash just after Tas yelled out that we were being ambushed If they were lucky they dived off the log and escaped into the swamp If not Sturm didnt finish Tanis closed his eyes to shut out the firelight He felt tired tired of fighting tired of killing tired of slogging through the muck He thought longingly of lying down and sinking back into sleep Instead he opened his eyes stalked over to the cage and rattled the bars A draconian guard turned around sword raised You speak Common Tanis asked in the very lowest crudest form of the Common language used on Krynn I speak Common Apparently better than you do elven scum the draconian sneered What do you want One of our party is injured We ask that you treat him Give him an antidote to this poison dart Poison The draconian peered into the cage Ah yes the magicuser The creature gurgled deep in its throat a sound obviously meant to be laughter Sick is he Yes the poison acts swiftly Cant have a magicuser around Even behind bars theyre deadly But dont worry He wont be lonelythe rest of you will be joining him soon enough In fact you should envy him Your deaths will not be nearly so quick The draconian turned its back and said something to its partner jerking its clawed thumb in the direction of the cage Both of them croaked their gurgling laughter Tanis feeling disgust and rage welling up deep inside of him looked back at Raistlin The mage was rapidly growing worse Goldmoon put her hand on Raistlins neck feeling for the life beat and then shook her head Caramon made a moaning sound Then his glance shifted to the two draconians laughing and talking together outside StopCaramon Tanis yelled but it was too late With a roar like a wounded animal the huge warrior leaped toward the draconians Bamboo gave way before him the shards splintering and cutting into his skin Mad with the desire to kill Caramon never noticed Tanis jumped on his back as the warrior crashed past him but Caramon shook him off as easily as a bear shakes off an annoying fly Caramon you fool Sturm grunted as he and Riverwind both threw themselves on the warrior But Caramons rage carried him on Whirling one draconian raised its sword but Caramon sent the weapon flying The creature hit the ground knocked senseless by a blow from the big mans fist Within seconds there were six draconians bows and arrows in their hands surrounding the warrior Sturm and Riverwind wrestled Caramon to the ground Sturm sitting on him shoved his face into the mud until he felt Caramon relax beneath him and heard him give a strangled sob At that instant a highpitched shrill voice screeched through the camp Bring the warrior to me said the dragon Tanis felt the hair rise on his neck The draconians lowered their weapons and turned to face the dragon staring in astonishment and muttering among themselves Riverwind and Sturm got to their feet Caramon lay on the ground choking with sobs The draconian guards glanced at each other uneasily while those standing near the dragon backed off hurriedly and formed an immense semicircle around it One of the creatures whom Tanis supposed by the insignia on its armor to be some sort of captain stalked up to a robed draconian who was staring openmouthed at the black dragon Whats going on the captain demanded The draconian spoke in the Common Tongue Tanis listening closely realized they were of different speciesthe robed draconians were apparently the magicusers and the priests Presumably the two could not communicate in their own languages The military draconian was clearly upset Where is that Bozak priest of yours He must tell us what to do The higher of my order is not here The robed draconian quickly regained his composure One of them flew here and took him to confer with Lord Verminaard about the staff But the dragon never speaks when the priest is not here The captain lowered his voice My boys dont like it You better do something quickly What is this delay The dragons voice shrieked like a wailing wind Bring me the warrior Do as the dragon says The robed draconian motioned quickly with a clawed hand Several draconians rushed over shoved Tanis and Riverwind and Sturm back into the shattered cage and lifted the bleeding Caramon up by the arms They dragged him over to stand before the dragon his back to the blazing fire Near him lay the blue crystal staff Raistlins staff their weapons and their packs Caramon raised his head to confront the monster his eyes blurred with tears and blood from the many cuts the bamboo had inflicted on his face The dragon loomed above him seen dimly through the smoke rising from the bonfire We mete out justice swiftly and surely human scum the dragon hissed As it spoke it beat its huge wings fanning them slowly The draconians gasped and began to back up some stumbling over themselves as they hurried to get out of the monsters way Obviously they knew what was coming Caramon stared at the creature without fear My brother is dying he shouted Do what you will to me I ask only one thing Give me my sword so that I can die fighting The dragon laughed shrilly the draconians joined it gurgling and croaking horribly As the dragons wings beat the air it began to rock back and forth seemingly preparing to leap on the warrior and devour him This will be fun Let him have his weapon the dragon commanded Its flapping wings caused a wind to whip through the camp scattering sparks from the fire Caramon shoved the draconian guards aside Wiping his hand across his eyes he walked over to the pile of weapons and pulled out his sword Then he turned to face the dragon resignation and grief etched into his face He raised his sword We cant let him die out there by himself Stunn said harshly and he took a step forward prepared to break out Suddenly a voice came from the shadows behind them Hssst Tanis The halfelf whirled around Flint he exclaimed then glanced apprehensively at the draconian guards but they were absorbed in watching the spectacle of Caramon and the dragon Tanis hurried to the back of the bamboo cage where the dwarf stood Get out of here the halfelf ordered Theres nothing you can do Raistlins dying and the dragon Is Tasslehoff Flint said succinctly What Tanis glared at the dwarf Make sense The dragon is Tasslehoff Flint repeated patiently For once Tanis was speechless He stared at the dwarf The dragons made of wicker the dwarf whispered hurriedly Tasslehoff sneaked behind it and looked inside Its rigged Anyone sitting inside the dragon can make the wings flap and speak through a hollow tube I guess thats how the priests keep order around here Anyway Tasslehoffs the one flapping his wings and threatening to eat Caramon Tanis gasped But what do we do Theres still a hundred draconians around Sooner or later theyre going to realize whats going on Get over to Caramon you and Riverwind and Sturm Grab your weapons and packs and the staff Ill help Goldmoon carry Raistlin into the woods Tasslehoffs got something in mind Just be ready Tanis groaned I dont like it any better than you do the dwarf growled Trusting our lives to that rattlebrained kender Butwell he is the dragon after all He certainly is Tanis said eyeing the dragon who was shrieking and wailing and flapping its wings and rocking back and forth The draconians were staring at it in openmouthed wonder Tanis grabbed Sturm and Riverwind and huddled down near Goldmoon who had not left Raistlins side The halfelf explained what was happening Sturm looked at him as if he were as crazed as Raistlin Riverwind shook his head Well have you got a better plan Tanis asked Both of them looked at the dragon then back at Tanis and shrugged Goldmoon goes with the dwarf Riverwind said She started to protest He looked at her his eyes expressionless and she swallowed and fell silent Yes Tanis said Stay with Raistlin lady please Well bring the staff to you Hurry then she said through white lips He is very nearly gone Well hurry Tanis said grimly I have a feeling that once things get started out there were going to be moving very fast He patted her hand Come on He stood up and took a deep breath Riverwinds eyes were still on Goldmoon He started to speak then shook his head irritably and turned without a word to stand beside Tanis Sturm joined them The three crept up behind the draconian guards Caramon lifted his sword It flashed in the firelight The dragon went into a wild frenzy and all of the draconians fell back braying and beating their swords against their shields Wind from the dragons wings blew up ashes and sparks from the fire setting some nearby bamboo huts on fire The draconians did not notice so eager were they for the kill The dragon shrieked and howled and Caramon felt his mouth go dry and his stomach muscles clench It was the first time he had ever gone into battle without his brother the thought made his heart throb painfully He was about to leap forward and attack when Tanis Sturm and Riverwind appeared out of nowhere to stand by his side We will not let our friend die alone the halfelf cried defiantly at the dragon The draconians cheered wildly Get out of here Tanis Caramon scowled his face flushed and streaked with tears This is my fight Shut up and listen Tanis ordered Get your sword and mine Sturm Riverwind grab your weapons and the packs and any draconian weapons you can pick up to replace those we lost Caramon pick up the two staffs Caramon stared at him What Tasslehoffs the dragon Tanis said There isnt time to explain Just do as I say Get the staff and take it into the woods Goldmoons waiting He laid his hand on the warriors shoulder Tanis shoved him Go Raistlins almost finished Youre his only chance This statement reached Caramons mind He ran to the pile of weapons and grabbed the blue crystal staff and Raistlins Staff of Magius while the draconians yelled Sturm and Riverwind armed themselves Sturm bringing Tanis his sword And now prepare to die humans the dragon screamed Its wings gave a great lurch and suddenly the creature was flying hovering in midair The draconians croaked and cried out in alarm some breaking for the woods others hurling themselves flat on the ground Now yelled Tanis Run Caramon The big warrior broke for the woods running swiftly toward where he could see Goldmoon and Flint waiting for him A draconian appeared in front of him but Caramon hurled it out of his way with a thrust of his great arm He could hear a wild commotion behind him Sturm chanting a Solamnic war cry draconians yelling Other draconians leaped at Caramon He used the blue crystal staff as he had seen Goldmoon use it swinging it in a wide arc with his huge right hand It flashed blue flame and the draconians fell back Caramon reached the woods and found Raistlin lying at Goldmoons feet barely breathing Goldmoon grabbed the staff from Caramon and laid it on the mages inert body Flint watched shaking his head It wont work muttered the dwarf Its used up It has to work Goldmoon said firmly Please she murmured whoever is master of this staff heal this man Please Unknowing she repeated it over and over Caramon watched for a moment blinking his eyes Then the woods around him were lit by a gigantic burst of flame Name of the Abyss Flint breathed Look at that Caramon turned just in time to see the great black wicker dragon crash headlong into the blazing bonfire Flaming logs flew into the air showering sparks over the camp The draconians bamboo huts some already ablaze began burning fiercely The wicker dragon gave a final horrifying shriek and then it too caught fire Tasslehoff Flint swore That blasted kenderhes inside there Before Caramon could stop him the dwarf ran out into the blazing draconian camp Caramon Raistlin murmured The big warrior knelt beside his brother Raistlin was still pale but his eyes were open and clear He sat up weakly leaning against his brother and stared out at the raging fire Whats going on Im not sure Caramon said Tasslehoff turned into a dragon and after that things get real confused You just rest The warrior stared into the smoke his sword drawn and ready in case any draconians came for them But the draconians now had little interest in the prisoners The smaller breed panic stricken were fleeing into the forest as their great goddragon went up in flames A few of the robed draconians bigger and apparently more intelligent than the other species were trying desperately to bring order to the fearful chaos raging around them Sturm fought and slashed his way through the draconians without encountering any organized resistance He had just reached the edge of the clearing near the bamboo cage when Flint passed him running back toward the camp Hey Where Sturm yelled at the dwarf Tasin the dragon The dwarf didnt stop Sturm turned and saw the black wicker dragon burning with flames that shot high into the air Thick smoke boiled up blanketing the camp the dank heavy swamp air preventing it from rising and drifting away Sparks showered down as part of the blazing dragon exploded into the camp Sturm ducked and batted out sparks that landed on his cape then ran after the dwarf catching up with the shortlegged Flint easily Flint he panted grasping the dwarfs arm Its no use Nothing could live in that furnace Weve got to get back to the others Let go of me Flint roared so furiously that Sturm let go in amazement The dwarf ran for the burning dragon again Sturm heaved a sigh and ran after him his eyes beginning to water in the smoke Tasslehoff Burrfoot Flint called You idiotic kender Where are you There was no answer Tasslehoff Flint screamed If you wreck this escape Ill murder you So help me Tears of frustration and grief and anger and smoke coursed down the dwarfs cheeks The heat was overwhelming It seared Sturms lungs and the knight knew they couldnt breathe much more of this or they would perish themselves He took hold of the dwarf firmly intending to knock him out if necessary when suddenly he saw movement near the edge of the blaze He rubbed his eyes and looked closer The dragon lay on the ground the head still connected to the blazing body by a long wicker neck The head had not caught fire yet but flames were starting to eat into the wicker neck The head would soon be ablaze too Sturm saw the movement again Flint Look Sturm ran toward the head the dwarf pounding along behind Two small legs encased in bright blue pants were sticking out of the dragons mouth kicking feebly Tas Sturm yelled Get out The heads going to burn I cant Im stuck came a muffled voice Sturm stared at the head frantically trying to figure out how to free the kender while Flint just grabbed hold of Tass legs and pulled Ouch Stop yelled Tas No good the dwarf puffed Hes stuck fast The inferno crept up the dragons neck Sturm drew his sword I may cut off his head he muttered to Flint but its his only chance Estimating the size of the kender guessing where his head would be and hoping his hands werent stretched out over his head Sturm lifted his sword above the dragons neck Flint closed his eyes The knight took a deep breath and brought his blade crash ing down on the dragon severing the head from the neck There was a cry from the kender inside but whether from pain or astonishment Sturm couldnt tell Pull he yelled at the dwarf Flint grabbed hold of the wicker head and pulled it away from the blazing neck Suddenly a tall dark shape loomed out of the smoke Sturm whipped around sword ready then saw it was Riverwind What are yo The Plainsman stared at the dragons head Perhaps Flint and Sturm had gone mad The kenders stuck in there Sturm yelled We cant take the head apart out here surrounded by draconians Weve got to His words were lost in a roar of flame but Riverwind finally saw the blue legs sticking out of the dragons mouth He grabbed hold of one side of the dragons head thrusting his hands in one of the eyesockets Sturm got hold of the other and together they lifted the headkender insideand began running through the camp Those few draconians they encountered took one look at the terrifying apparition and fled Cmon Raist Caramon said solicitously his arm around his brothers shoulder Youve got to try and stand We have to be ready to move out of here How do you feel How do I ever feel whispered Raistlin bitterly Help me up There Now leave me in peace for a moment He leaned against a tree shivering but standing Sure Raist Caramon said hurt backing off Goldmoon glanced at Raistlin in disgust remembering Caramons grief when he thought his brother was dying She turned away to watch for the others staring through the gathering smoke Tanis appeared first running so fast he crashed into Caramon The big warrior caught him in his huge arms breaking the halfelfs forward momentum and keeping him on his feet Thanks Tanis gasped He leaned over hands on his knees to catch his breath Where are the others Werent they with you Caramon frowned We got separated Tanis drew in huge gulps of air then coughed as the smoke flew down his lungs SuTorakh interrupted Goldmoon in an awed voice Tanis and Caramon both spun around in alarm staring out into the smokefilled camp to see a grotesque sight emerging from the swirling smoke A dragons head with a forked blue tongue was lunging at them Tanis blinked in disbelief then he heard a sound behind him that nearly made him leap into a tree in panic He whirled around heart in his throat sword in his hand Raistlin was laughing Tanis had never heard the mage laugh beforeeven when Raistlin was a childand he hoped he would never hear it again It was weird shrill mocking laughter Caramon stared at his brother in amazement Goldmoon in horror Finally the sound of Raistlins laughter died until the mage was laughing silently his golden eyes reflecting the glow of the draconian camp going up in flames Tanis shuddered and turned back around to see that in fact the dragons head was carried by Sturm and Riverwind Flint raced along in front a draconian helm on his head Tanis ran forward to meet them What in the name of The kenders stuck in here Sturm said He and Riverwind dropped the head to the ground both of them breathing heavily Weve got to get him out Sturm eyed the laughing Raistlin warily Whats the matter with him Still poisoned No hes better Tanis said examining the dragons head A pity Sturm muttered as he knelt beside the halfelf Tas are you all right Tanis called out lifting the huge mouth to see inside I think Sturm chopped off my hair the kender wailed Lucky it wasnt your head Flint snorted Whats holding him Riverwind leaned down to peer inside the dragons mouth Im not sure Tanis said swearing softly I cant see in all this blasted smoke He stood up sighing in frustration And weve got to get out of here The draconians will get organized soon Caramon come here See if you can rip off the top The big warrior came over to stand in front of the wicker dragons head Bracing himself he got hold of the two eyesockets closed his eyes took a deep breath then grunted and heaved For a minute nothing happened Tanis watched the muscles bulge on the big mans arms saw his thigh muscles absorb the strain Blood rushed to Caramons face Then there was the ripping and snapping sound of wood splintering The top of the dragons head gave way with a sharp crack Caramon staggered backwards as the top half of the head suddenly came off in his hands Tanis reached in grabbed Tass hand and jerked him free Are you all right he asked The kender seemed wobbly on his feet but his grin was wide as ever Im fine Tas said brightly Just a little singed Then his face darkened Tanis he said his face crinkling with unusual worry He felt at his long topknot My hair All there Tanis said smiling Tas breathed a sigh of relief Then he began to talk Tanis it was the most wonderful thing flying like that And the look on Caramons face The story will have to wait Tanis said firmly Weve got to get out of here Caramon Can you and your brother make it all right Yeah go on Caramon said Raistlin stumbled forward accepting the support of his brothers strong arm The mage glanced behind at the sundered dragons head and he wheezed his shoulders shaking in silent grim amusement Escape The well Death on black wings Smoke from the burning draconian camp hung over the black swamplands shielding the companions from the eyes of the strange evil creatures The smoke floated wraithlike through the swamps drifting across the silver moon and obscuring the stars The companions dared not risk a lighteven the light from Raistlins stafffor they could hear horns blowing all around them as the draconian leaders tried to reestablish order Riverwind led them Although Tanis had always prided himself on his own woodland skills he completely lost all sense direction in the black misty mire An occasional fleeting glimpse of the stars whenever the smoke lifted showed him that they were bearing north They hadnt gone far when Riverwind missed a step and plunged kneedeep into muck After Tanis and Caramon dragged the Plainsman out of the water Tasslehoff crept ahead testing the ground with his hoopak staff It sank every time We have no choice but to wade Riverwind said grimly Choosing a path where the water seemed shallower the company left firm ground and splashed into the muck At first it was only ankle deep then they sank to their knees Soon they sank deeper still Tanis was forced to carry Tasslehoff the giggling kender grasping him around the neck Flint steadfastly refused all offers of help even when the tip of his beard got wet Then he vanished Caramon following him fished the dwarf out of the water and slung him over his shoulder like a wet sack the dwarf too tired and frightened to grumble Raistlin staggered coughing through the water his robes dragging him down Weary and still sick from the poison the mage finally collapsed Sturm grabbed hold of him and halfdragged halfcarried the mage through the swamp After an hour of floundering in the icy water they finally reached firm ground and sank down to rest shivering with the cold The trees began to creak and groan their branches bending as a sharp wind sprang up from the north The wind blew the mists into wispy rags Raistlin lying on the ground looked up The mage caught his breath He sat up alarmed Storm clouds He choked coughing and fought to speak They come from the north We have no time No time We must reach Xak Tsaroth Hurry Before the moon sets Everyone looked up A gathering darkness was moving out of the north swallowing up the stars Tanis could feel the same sense of urgency that was driving the mage Wearily he rose to his feet Without a word the rest of the group rose and stumbled forward Riverwind taking the lead But dark swamp water blocked their path once more Not again Flint moaned No we do not have to wade again Come look Riverwind said He led the way to the waters edge There amid many other ruins protruding from the dank ground lay an obelisk that had either fallen or been pushed over to form a bridge across to the other bank of the swamp Ill go first Tas volunteered hopping energetically onto the long stone Hey theres writing on this thing Runes of some sort I must see Raistlin whispered hurrying over He spoke his word of command Shirak and the crystal on the tip of his staff burst into light Hurry Sturm growled Youve just told everything within a twentymile radius were here But Raistlin would not be rushed He held the light over the spidery runes studying them intently Tanis and the others climbed onto the obelisk and joined the mage The kender bent down tracing the runes with his small hand What does it say Raistlin Can you read it The language seems very old It is old the mage whispered It dates from before the Cataclysm The runes say The Great City of Xak Tsaroth whose beauty Surrounds you speaks to the good of its people and their generous deeds The gods reward us in the grace of our home How awful Goldmoon shuddered looking at the ruin and desolation around her The gods rewarded them indeed Raistlin said his lips parting in a cynical smile No one spoke Then Raistlin whispered Durakc and extinguished the light Suddenly the night seemed much blacker We must keep going the mage said Surely there is more than a fallen monument to mark what this place once stood for They crossed the obelisk into thick jungle At first there seemed to be no trail then Riverwind searching diligently found a trail cut through the vines and the trees He bent down to study it His face was grim when he rose Draconians Tanis asked Yes he said heavily The tracks of many clawed feet And they lead north straight to the city Tanis asked in an undertone Is this the broken citywhere you were given the staff And where death had black wings Riverwind added He closed his eyes wiping his hand over his face Then he drew a deep ragged breath I dont know I cant rememberbut I am afraid without knowing why Tanis put his hand on Riverwinds arm The elves have a saying Only the dead are without fear Riverwind startled him by suddenly clasping the halfelfs hand with his I have never known an elf the Plainsman said My people distrust them saying that the elves have no care for Krynn or for humans I think my people may have been mistaken I am glad I met you Tanis of Qualinost I count you as a friend Tanis knew enough of Plains lore to realize that with this statement Riverwind had declared himself willing to sacrifice everything for the halfelfeven his life A vow of friendship was a solemn vow among the Plainsmen You are my friend too Riverwind Tanis said simply You and Goldmoon both are my friends Riverwind turned his eyes to Goldmoon who stood near them leaning on her staff her eyes closed her face drawn with pain and exhaustion Riverwinds face softened with compassion as he looked at her Then it hardened pride drawing the stem mask over it again Xak Tsaroth is not far off he said coolly And these tracks are old He led the way into the jungle After only a short walk the northern trail suddenly changed to cobblestones A street exclaimed Tasslehoff The outskirts of Xak Tsaroth Raistlin breathed About time Flint stared all around in disgust What a mess If the greatest gift ever given to man is here it must be well hidden Tanis agreed He had never seen a more dismal place As they walked the broad street took them into an open paved courtyard To the east stood four tall freestanding columns that supported nothing the building lay in ruins around them A huge unbroken circular stone wall rose about four feet above the ground Caramon going over to inspect it announced that it was a well Deep at that he said He leaned over and peered down into it Smells bad too North of the well stood what appeared to be the only building to have escaped the destruction of the Cataclysm It was finely constructed of pure white stone supported by tall slender columns Large golden double doors gleamed in the moonlight That was a temple to the ancient gods Raistlin said more to himself than anyone else But Goldmoon standing near him heard his soft whisper A temple she repeated staring at the building How beautiful She walked toward it strangely fascinated Tanis and the rest searched the grounds and found no other buildings intact Fluted columns lay on the ground their broken pieces aligned to show their former beauty Statues lay broken and in some cases grotesquely defaced Everything was old so old it made even the dwarf feel young Flint sat down on a column Well were here He blinked at Raistlin and yawned What now mage Raistlins thin lips parted but before he could reply Tasslehoff yelled Draconian Everyone spun around weapons in their hands A draconian ready to move was glaring at them from the edge of the well Stop it Tanis shouted It will alert others But before anyone could reach it the draconian spread its wings and flew into the well Raistlin his golden eyes flaring in the moonlight ran to the well and peered over the edge Raising his hand as if to cast a spell he hesitated then dropped his hand limply to his side I cant he said I cant think I cant concentrate I must sleep Were all tired Tanis said wearily If somethings down there it warned it Theres nothing we can do now Weve got to rest It has gone to warn something Raistlin whispered He huddled in his cloak and stared around his eyes wide Cant you feel it Any of you HalfElf Evil about to waken and come forth Silence fell Then Tasslehoff climbed up on the stone wall and peered down Look The draconian is floating down just like a leaf His wings dont flap Be quiet Tanis snapped Tasslehoff glanced at the halfelf in surpriseTaniss voice sounded strained and unnatural The halfelf was staring at the well his hands clenching nervously Everything was still Too still The storm clouds massed to the north but there was no wind Not a branch creaked not a leaf stirred The silver moon and the red cast twin shadows that made things seen from the corner of the eye unreal and distorted Then slowly Raistlin backed away from the well raising his hands before him as if to ward off some dreadful danger I feel it too Tanis swallowed What is it Yes what is it Tasslehoff leaning over stared eagerly into the well It looked as deep and dark as the mages hourglass eye Get him away from there Raistlin cried Tanis infected by the mages fear and his own growing sense that something was terribly wrong started to run for Tas Even as he began to move though he felt the ground shake beneath his feet The kender gave a startled cry as the ancient stone wall of the well cracked and gave way beneath him Tas felt himself sliding into the terrible blackness below him He scrabbled frantically with his hands and feet trying to clutch the crumbling rocks Tanis lunged desperately but he was too far away Riverwind had started moving when he heard Raistlins cry and the tall mans long swift strides carried him quickly to the well Catching hold of Tas by his collar the Plainsman plucked him from the wall just as the stones and mortar tumbled down into the blackness below The ground trembled again Tanis tried to force his numb mind to figure out what was happening Then a blast of cold air burst from the well The wind swept dirt and leaves from the courtyard into the air stinging his face and eyes Run Tanis tried to yell but he choked on the foul stench erupting from the well The columns left standing after the Cataclysm began to shake The companions stared fearfully at the well Then Riverwind tore his gaze away Goldmoon he said looking around He dropped Tas to the ground Goldmoon He stopped as a highpitched shriek rose from the depths of the well The sound was so loud and shrill that it pierced the head Riverwind searched frantically for Goldmoon calling her name Tanis was stunned by the noise Unable to move he saw Sturm hand on his sword slowly back away from the well He saw Raistlinthe mages ghastly face glistening metallic yellow his golden eyes red in the red moons lightscream something Tanis couldnt hear He saw Tasslehoff staring at the well in wideeyed wonder Sturm ran across the courtyard scooped up the kender under one arm and ran on to the trees Caramon ran to his exhausted brother caught him up and headed for cover Tanis knew some monstrous evil was coming up out of the well but he could not move The words run fool run screamed in his brain Riverwind too stayed near the well fighting the fear that was growing within him he couldnt find Goldmoon Distracted by rescuing the kender from tumbling into the well he had not seen Goldmoon approach the unbroken temple He looked around wildly struggling to keep his balance as the ground shook beneath his feet The highpitched shrieking noise the throbbing and trembling of the ground brought back hideous nightmarish memories Death on black wings He began to sweat and shake then forced his mind to concentrate on Goldmoon She needed him he knewand he alone knewthat her show of strength only masked her fear doubt uncertainty She would be terribly afraid and he had to find her As the stones of the well began to slide Riverwind moved away and caught sight of Tanis The halfelf was shouting and pointing past Riverwind toward the temple Riverwind knew Tanis was saying something but he couldnt hear above the shrieking sound Then he knew Goldmoon Riverwind turned to go to her but he lost his balance and fell to his knees He saw Tanis start to run toward him Then the horror burst from the wellthe horror of his fevered nightmares Riverwind closed his eyes and saw no more It was a dragon Tanis in those first few moments when the blood seemed to drain from his body leaving him limp and lifeless looked at the dragon as it burst forth from the well and thought How beautiful how beautiful Sleek and black the dragon rose her glistening wings folded close to her sides her scales gleaming Her eyes glowed redblack the color of molten rock Her mouth opened in a snarl teeth flashing white and wicked Her long red tongue curled as she breathed the night air Clear of the wells confines the dragon spread her wings blotting out stars obliterating moonlight Each wing was tipped with a pure white claw that shone bloodred in the light of Lunitari Fear such as Tanis had never imagined shriveled his stomach His heart throbbed painfully he couldnt catch his breath He could only stare in horror and awe and marvel at the creatures deadly beauty The dragon circled higher and higher into the night sky Then just as Tanis felt the paralyzing fear start to recede just as he began to fumble for his bow and arrows the dragon spoke One word she saida word in the language of magicand a thick terrible darkness fell from the sky blinding them all Tanis instantly lost all grasp on where he was He only knew there was a dragon above him about to attack He was powerless to defend himself All he could do was crouch down crawl among the rubble and try desperately to hide Deprived of his sense of sight the halfelf concentrated on his sense of hearing The shrieking noise had stopped as the darkness fell Tanis could hear the slow gentle flap of the dragons leathery wings and knew it was circling above them rising gradually Then he couldnt hear even the flapping anymore the wings had quit beating He visualized a great black bird of prey hovering alone waiting Then there was a very gentle rustling sound the sound of leaves shivering as the wind rises before a storm The sound grew louder and louder until it was the rushing of wind when the storm hits and then it was the shrieking of the hurricane Tanis pressed his body close against the crumbled well and covered his head with his arms The dragon was attacking She could not see through the darkness she had cast but Khisanth knew that the intruders were still in the courtyard below Her minions the draconians had warned her that a group walked the land carrying the blue crystal staff Lord Verminaard wanted that staff wanted it kept safe with her never to be seen in human lands But she had lost it and Lord Verminaard had not been pleased She had to get it back Therefore Khisanth had waited an instant before casting her darkness spell studying the intruders carefully searching for the staff Unaware that already it had passed beyond her sight she was pleased She had only to destroy The attacking dragon dropped from the sky her leathery wings curving back like the blade of a black dagger She dove straight for the well where she had seen the intruders running for their lives Knowing that they would be paralyzed by dragonfear Khisanth was certain she could kill them all with one pass She opened her fanged mouth Tanis heard the dragon coming nearer The great rushing sound grew louder and louder then stopped for an instant He could hear huge tendons creaking lifting and spreading giant wings Then he heard a great gasping sound as of air being drawn into a gaping throat then a strange sound that reminded him of steam escaping from a boiling kettle Something liquid splashed near him He could hear rocks splitting and cracking and bubbling Drops of the liquid splashed on his hand and he gasped as a searing pain penetrated his being Then Tanis heard a scream It was a deepvoiced scream a mans screamRiverwind So terrible so agonized was the scream that Tanis dug his fingernails into his palms to keep from adding his own voice to that horrible wail and revealing himself to the dragon The screaming seemed to go on and on and then it died into a moan Tanis felt the rush of a large body swoosh past him in the darkness The stones he pressed his body against shook Then the tremor of the dragons passage sank lower and lower into the depths of the well Finally the ground was still There was silence Tanis drew a painful breath and opened his eyes The darkness was gone The stars shone the moons glowed in the sky For a moment the halfelf could do nothing but breathe and breathe again trying to calm his shaking body Then he was on his feet running toward a dark form lying in the stone courtyard Tanis was the first to reach the Plainsmans body He took one look then choked and turned away What remained of Riverwind no longer resembled anything human The mans flesh had been seared from his body The white of bone was clearly visible where skin and muscle had melted from his arms His eyes ran like jelly down the fleshless cadaverous cheeks His mouth gaped open in a silent scream His ribcage lay exposed hunks of flesh and charred cloth clinging to the bones Butmost horriblethe flesh on his torso had been burned away leaving the organs exposed pulsing red in the garish red moonlight Tanis sank down vomiting The halfelf had seen men die on his sword He had seen them hacked to pieces by trolls But this this was horribly different and Tanis knew the memory of this would haunt him forever A strong arm gripped him by the shoulders offering silent comfort and sympathy and understanding The nausea passed Tanis sat back and breathed He wiped his mouth and nose then tried to force himself to swallow gagging painfully You all right Caramon asked with concern Tanis nodded unable to speak Then he turned at the sound of Stunns voice May the true gods have mercy Tanis hes still alive I saw his hand move Sturm choked He could say no more Tanis rose to his feet and walked shakily toward the body One of the charred and blackened hands had risen from the stones plucking horribly at the air End it Tanis said hoarsely his throat raw from bile End it Sturm The knight had already drawn his sword Kissing the hilt he raised the blade to the sky and stood before Riverwinds body He closed his eyes and mentally withdrew into an old world where death in battle had been glorious and fine Slowly and solemnly he began to recite the ancient Solamnic Death Chant As he spoke the words that laid hold of the warriors soul and transported it to realms of peace beyond he reversed the blade of the sword and held it poised above Riverwinds chest Return this man to Humas breast Beyond the wild impartial skies Grant to him a warriors rest And set the last spark of his eyes Free from the smothering clouds of wars Upon the torches of the stars Let the last surge of his breath Take refuge in the cradling air Above the dreams of ravens where Only the hawk remembers death Then let his shade to Huma rise Beyond the wild impartial skies The knights voice sank Tanis felt the peace of the gods wash over him like cool cleansing water easing his grief and submerging the horror Caramon beside him wept silently As they watched moonlight flashed on the sword blade Then a clear voice spoke Stop Bring him to me Both Tanis and Caramon sprang up to stand in front of the mans tortured body knowing that Goldmoon must be spared this hideous sight Sturm lost in tradition came back to reality with a start and reversed his killing stroke Goldmoon stood a tall slender shadow silhouetted against the golden moonlit doors of the temple Tanis started to speak but he felt suddenly the cold hand of the mage grip his arm Shivering he jerked away from Raistlins touch Do as she says the mage hissed Carry him to her Taniss face contorted with fury at the sight of Raistlins expressionless face uncaring eyes Take him to her Raistlin said coldly It is not for us to choose death for this man That is for the gods A bitter choice The greatest gift Tanis stared at Raistlin Not the quiver of an eyelid betrayed his feelingsif the mage had any feelings Their eyes met and as always Tanis felt that the mage saw more than was visible to him Suddenly Tanis hated Raistlin hated him with a passion that shocked the halfelf hated him for not feeling this pain hated him and envied him at the same time We must do something Sturm said harshly Hes not dead and the dragon may return Very well Tanis said his voice catching in his throat Wrap him in a blanket But give me a moment alone with Goldmoon The halfelf walked slowly across the courtyard His footsteps echoed in the stillness of the night as he climbed marble steps to a wide porch where Goldmoon stood in front of the shining golden doors Glancing behind him Tanis could see his friends wrapping blankets from their packs around tree limbs to make a battlefield stretcher The mans body was nothing more than a dark shapeless mass in the moonlight Bring him to me Tanis Goldmoon repeated as the halfelf came up to her He took hold of her hand Goldmoon Tanis said Riverwind is horribly injured He is dying There is nothing you can donot even the staff Hush Tanis Goldmoon said gently The halfelf fell silent seeing her clearly for the first time In astonishment he realized that the Plainswoman was tranquil calm uplifted Her face in the moonlight was the face of the sailor who has fought the stormy seas in his fragile boat and drifted at last into peaceful waters Come inside the temple my friend Goldmoon said her beautiful eyes looking intently into Tanis Come inside and bring Riverwind to me Goldmoon had not heard the approach of the dragon had not seen its attack on Riverwind When they entered the broken courtyard of Xak Tsaroth Goldmoon had felt a strange and powerful force drawing her into the temple She walked across the rubble and up the stairs oblivious to everything but the golden doors shimmering in the silverred moonlight She approached them and stood before them for a moment Then she became aware of the commotion behind her and heard Riverwind calling her name Goldmoon She paused unwilling to leave Riverwind and her friends knowing a terrible evil was rising from the well Come inside child a gentle voice called to her Goldmoon lifted her head and stared at the doors Tears came to her eyes The voice was her mothers Tearsong priestess of Queshu had died long ago when Goldmoon was very young Tearsong Goldmoon choked Mother The years have been many and sad for you my daughterher mothers voice was not heard so much as felt in her heartand I fear your burden will not soon ease Indeed if you continue on you will leave this darkness only to enter a deeper darkness Truth will light your way my daughter though you may find its light shines dimly in the vast and terrible night ahead Still without the truth all will perish and be lost Come here inside the temple with me daughter You will find what you seek But my friends Riverwind Goldmoon looked back at the well and saw Riverwind stumble on the shaking cobblestones They cannot fight this evil They will die without me The staff could help I cannot leave She started to turn back as the darkness fell I cant see them Riverwind Mother help me she cried in agony But there was no answer This isnt fair Goldmoon screamed silently clenching her fists We never wanted this We only wanted to love each other and nownow we may lose that We have sacrificed so much and none of it has made any difference I am thirty years old mother Thirty and childless They have taken my youth they have taken my people And I have nothing to show in return Nothing except this She shook the staff And now I am being asked once again to give still more Her anger calmed Riverwindhad he been angry all those long years he searched for answers All he had found was this staff and it brought only more questions No he hadnt been angry she thought His faith is strong I am the weak one Riverwind was willing to die for his faith It seems I must be willing to liveeven if it means living without him Goldmoon leaned her head against the golden doors their metal surface cool to her skin Reluctantly she made her bitter decision I will go forward motherthough if Riverwind dies my heart dies too I ask only one thing If he dies let him know somehow that I will continue his search Leaning upon her staff the Chieftain of the Queshu pushed open the golden doors and entered the temple The doors shut behind her at the precise moment the black dragon burst from the well Goldmoon stepped inside soft enfolding darkness She could see nothing at first but a memory of being held very close in her mothers warm embrace played through her mind A pale light began to shine around her Goldmoon saw she was under a vast dome that rose high above an intricately inlaid tile floor Beneath the dome in the center of the room stood a marble statue of singular grace and beauty The light in the room emanated from this statue Goldmoon entranced moved toward it The statue was of a woman in flowing robes Her marble face bore an expression of radiant hope tempered with sadness A strange amulet hung around her neck This is Mishakal goddess of healing whom I serve said her mothers voice Listen to her words my daughter Goldmoon stood directly in front of the statue marveling at its beauty But it seemed unfinished incomplete Part of the statue was missing Goldmoon realized The marble womans hands were curved as if they had been holding a long slender pole but the hands were empty Without conscious thought with only the need to complete such beauty Goldmoon slid her staff into the marble hands It began to gleam with a soft blue light Goldmoon startled backed away The staffs light grew into a blinding radiance Goldmoon shielded her eyes and fell to her knees A great and loving power filled her heart She bitterly regretted her anger Do not be ashamed of your questioning beloved disciple It was your questioning that led you to us and it is your anger that will sustain you through the many trials ahead You come seeking the truth and you shall receive it The gods have not turned away from manit is man who turned away from the true gods Krynn is about to face its greatest trial Men will need the truth more than ever You my disciple must return the truth and power of the true gods to man It is time to restore the balance of the universe Evil now has tipped the scales For as the gods of good have returned to man so have the gods of evilconstantly striving for mens souls The Queen of Darkness has returned seeking that which will allow her to walk freely in this land once more Dragons once banished to the nether regions walk the land Dragons thought Goldmoon dreamily She found it difficult to concentrate and grasp the words that flooded her mind It would not be until later that she would fully comprehend the message Then she would remember the words forever To gain the power to defeat them you will need the truth of the godsthis is the greatest gift of which you were told Below this temple in the ruins haunted by the glories of ages past rest the Disks of Mishakal circular disks made of gleaming platinum Find the Disks and you can call upon my power for I am Mishakal goddess of healing Your way will not be easy The gods of evil know and fear the great power of the truth The ancient and powerful black dragon Khisanth known to men as Onyx guards the Disks Her lair is in the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth below us Danger lies ahead of you if you choose to try and recover the Disks Therefore I bless this staff Present it boldly never wavering and you shall prevail The voice faded It was then Goldmoon heard Riverwinds death cry Tanis entered the temple and felt as if he had walked backward into memory The sun was shining through the trees in Qualinost He and Laurana and her brother Gilthanas were lying on the riverbank laughing and sharing dreams after some childish game Happy childhood days had been few for Tanis the halfelf learned early that he was different from the others But that day had been a day of golden sunshine and warm friendship The remembered peace washed over him easing his grief and horror He turned to Goldmoon standing silently beside him What is this place That is a story whose telling must wait Goldmoon answered With a light hand on Taniss arm she drew him across the shimmering tile floor until they both stood before the shining marble statue of Mishakal The blue crystal staff cast a brilliant glow throughout the chamber But even as Taniss lips parted in wonder a shadow darkened the room He and Goldmoon turned toward the door Caramon and Sturm entered bearing the body of Riverwind between them on the makeshift litter Flint and Tasslehoff the dwarf looking old and weary the kender unusually subdued stood on either side of the litter an odd sort of honor guard The somber procession moved slowly inside Behind them came Raistlin his hood pulled over his head his hands folded in his robesthe spectre of death itself They moved across the marble floor intent on the burden they bore and came to a halt before Tanis and Goldmoon Tanis looking down at the body at Goldmoons feet shut his eyes Blood had soaked through the thick blanket spreading in great dark splotches across the fabric Remove the blanket Goldmoon commanded Caramon looked at Tanis pleadingly Goldmoon Tanis began gently Suddenly before anyone could stop him Raistlin bent down and tore the bloodstained blanket from the body Goldmoon gave a strangled gasp at the sight of Riverwinds tortured body turning so pale that Tanis reached out a steadying hand fearing she might faint But Goldmoon was the daughter of a strong proud people She swallowed drew a deep shuddering breath Then she turned and walked up to the marble statue She lifted the blue crystal staff carefully from the goddesss hands then she returned to kneel beside Riverwinds body Kantokah she said softly My beloved Reaching out a shaking hand she touched the dying Plainsmans forehead The sightless face moved toward her as if he heard One of the blackened hands twitched feebly as if he would touch her Then he gave a great shudder and lay perfectly still Tears streamed unheeded down Goldmoons cheeks as she lay the staff across Riverwinds body Soft blue light filled the chamber Everyone the light touched felt rested and refreshed The pain and exhaustion from the days toil left their bodies The horror of the dragons attack lifted from their minds as the sun burns through fog Then the light of the staff dimmed and faded Night settled over the temple lit once more only by the light emanating from the marble statue Tanis blinked trying once more to reaccustom his eyes to the dark Then he heard a deep voice Kantokah neh sirakan He heard Goldmoon cry out in joy Tanis looked down at what should have been Riverwinds corpse Instead he saw the Plainsman sit up holding out his arms for Goldmoon She clung to him laughing and crying at the same time And so Goldmoon told them coming to the end of her story we must find a way down into the ruined city that lies somewhere below the temple and we must remove the Disks from the dragons lair They were eating a frugal dinner sitting on the floor in the main chamber of the temple A quick inspection of the building revealed that it was empty although Caramon told of finding draconian tracks on the staircase as well as the tracks of some other creature the warrior couldnt identify It was not a large building Two worship rooms were located on opposite sides of the hallway that led to the main chamber where the statue stood Two circular rooms branched off the main chamber to the north and south They were decorated with frescoes that were now covered with fungus and faded beyond recognition Two sets of golden double doors led to the east Caramon reported finding a staircase there that led down into the wrecked city below The faint sound of surf could be heard reminding them that they were perched on top of a great cliff overlooking Newsea The companions sat each preoccupied with his own thoughts trying to assimilate the news Goldmoon had given them Tasslehoff however continued to poke around the rooms peering into dark corners Finding little of interest the kender grew bored and returned to the group holding an old helmet in his hand It was too big for him kenderfolk never wore helmets anyway considering them bothersome and restrictive He tossed it to the dwarf Whats this Flint asked suspiciously holding it up to the light cast by Raistlins staff It was a helm of ancient design well crafted by a skilled metalsmith Undoubtedly a dwarf Flint decided rubbing his hands over it lovingly A long tail of animal hair decorated the top Flint tossed the draconian helm he had been wearing to the floor Then he put the newfound helm on his head It fit perfectly Smiling he took it off once more admiring the workmanship Tas watched him with amusement Thats horsehair he said pointing to the tassel No its not the dwarf protested frowning He sniffed at it wrinkling his nose Failing to sneeze he glanced at Tanis in triumph Its hair from the mane of a griffon Caramon guffawed Griffon He snorted Theres about as many griffons on Krynn as there are Dragons interjected Raistlin smoothly The conversation died abruptly Sturm cleared his throat Wed better get some sleep he said Ill take first watch No one need keep watch this night Goldmoon said softly She sat close to Riverwind The tall Plainsman had not spoken much since his brush with death He had stared for a long time at the statue of Mishakal recognizing the woman in blue light who had given him the staff but he refused to answer any questions or discuss it We are safe here Goldmoon affirmed glancing at the statue Caramon raised his eyebrows Sturm frowned and stroked his moustaches Both men were too polite to question Goldmoons faith but Tanis knew that neither warrior would feel safe if watches werent set Yet there werent many hours left until dawn and they all needed rest Raistlin was already asleep wrapped in his robes in a dark corner of the chamber I think Goldmoon is right Tasslehoff said Lets trust these old gods since it seems we have found them The elves never lost them neither did the dwarves Flint protested scowling I dont understand any of this Reorx is one of the ancient gods presumably We have worshipped him since before the Cataclysm Worship Tanis asked Or cry to him in despair because your people were shut out of the Kingdom under the Mountain No dont get mad Tanis seeing the dwarfs face flush an ugly red held up his hand The elves are no better We cried to the gods when our homeland was laid waste We know of the gods and we honor their memoriesas one would honor the dead The elven clerics vanished long ago as did the dwarven clerics I remember Mishakal the Healer I remember hearing the stories of her when I was young I remember hearing stories of dragons too Childrens tales Raistlin would say It seems our childhood has come back to haunt usor save us I dont know which I have seen two miracles tonight one of evil and one of good I must believe in both if I am to trust the evidence of my senses Yet The halfelf sighed I say we take turns on watch tonight I am sorry lady I wish my faith were as strong as yours Sturm took first watch The rest wrapped themselves in their blankets and lay on the tile floor The knight walked through the moonlit temple checking the quiet rooms more from force of habit than because he felt any threat He could hear the wind blow chill and fierce outside sweeping out from the north But inside it was strangely warm and comfortabletoo comfortable Sitting at the base of the statue Sturm felt a sweet peacefulness creep over him Startled he sat bolt upright and realized chagrined that he had nearly fallen asleep on watch That was inexcusable Berating himself severely the knight determined that he would walk his watchthe full two hoursas punishment He started to rise then stopped He heard singing a womans voice Sturm stared around wildly his hand on his sword Then his hand slipped from the hilt He recognized the voice and the song It was his mothers voice Once more Sturm was with her They were fleeing Solamnia traveling alone except for one trusted retainerand he would be dead before they reached Solace The song was one of those wordless lullabies that were older than dragons Sturms mother held her child close and tried to keep her fear from him by singing this gentle soothing song Sturms eyes closed Sleep blessed him blessed all of the companions The light from Raistlins staff glowed brightly keeping away the darkness The Paths of the Dead Raistlins new friends The sound of metal crashing against the tile floor jolted Tanis out of a deep sleep He sat up alarmed his hand fumbling for his sword Sorry Caramon said grinning shamefacedly I dropped my breastplate Tanis drew a deep breath that turned into a yawn stretched and lay back down on his blanket The sight of Caramon putting on his armorwith Tasslehoffs helpreminded the halfelf of what they faced today He saw Sturm buckling his armor on as well while Riverwind polished the sword he had picked up Tanis firmly put the thought of what might happen to them today out of his mind That was not an easy task especially for the elven part of Taniselves revere life and although they believe that death is simply a movement into a higher plane of existence death of any creature is seen to diminish life on this plane Tanis forced the human side of him to take possession of his soul today He would have to kill and perhaps he would have to accept the death of one or more of these people he loved He remembered how he had felt yesterday when he thought he might lose Riverwind The halfelf frowned and sat up suddenly feeling as if he had awakened from a bad dream Is everyone up he asked scratching his beard Flint stumped over and handed him a hunk of bread and some dried strips of venison Up and breakfasted the dwarf grumbled You could have slept through the Cataclysm HalfElf Tanis took a bite of venison without appetite Then wrinkling his nose he sniffed Whats that funny smell Some concoction of the mages The dwarf grimaced plopping down next to Tanis Flint pulled out a block of wood and began carving hacking away furiously making chips fly He pounded up some sort of powder in a cup and added water Stirred it up and drank it but not before it made that gullymudge smell Im happier not knowing what it was Tanis agreed He chewed on the venison Raistlin was now reading his spellbook murmuring the words over and over until he had committed them to memory Tanis wondered what kind of spell Raistlin had that might be useful against a dragon From what little he remembered about dragonlorelearned ages ago from the elven bard Quivalen Soth only the spells of the very greatest mages had a chance of affecting dragons who could work their own magicas they had witnessed Tanis looked at the frail young man absorbed in his spellbook and shook his head Raistlin might be powerful for his age and he was certainly devious and clever But dragons were ancient They had been in Krynn before the first elvesthe oldest of the raceswalked the land Of course if the plan the companions discussed last night worked out they wouldnt even encounter the dragon They hoped simply to find the lair and escape with the Disks It was a good plan Tanis thought and probably worth about as much as smoke on the wind Despair began to creep over him like a dank fog Well Im all set Caramon announced cheerfully The big warrior felt immeasurably better in his armor The dragon seemed a very small annoyance this morning He tunelessly whistled an old marching song as he stuffed his mudstained clothing into his pack Sturm his armor carefully adjusted sat apart from the companions his eyes closed performing whatever secret ritual knights performed preparing himself mentally for combat Tanis stood up stiff and cold moving around to get the circulation going and ease the soreness from his muscles Elves did nothing before battle except ask forgiveness for taking life We too are ready Goldmoon said She was dressed in a heavy gray tunic made of soft leather trimmed with fur She had braided her long silvergold hair in a twist around her heada precaution against an enemy using her hair to gain a handhold Lets get this over with Tanis sighed as he picked up the longbow and quiver of arrows Riverwind had taken from the draconian camp and slung them over his shoulder In addition Tanis was armed with a dagger and his longsword Sturm had his twohanded sword Caramon carried his shield a longsword and two daggers Riverwind had scrounged Flint had replaced his lost battleaxe with one from the draconian camp Tasslehoff had his hoopak and a small dagger he had discovered He was very proud of it and was deeply wounded when Caramon told him it would be of use if they ran into any ferocious rabbits Riverwind bore his longsword strapped to his back and still carried Taniss dagger Goldmoon bore no weapon other than the staff Were well armed Tanis thought gloomily For all the good it will do us The companions left the chamber of Mishakal Goldmoon coming last She gently touched the statue of the goddess with her hand as she passed whispering a silent prayer Tas led the way skipping merrily his topknot bouncing behind him He was going to see a real live dragon The kender couldnt imagine anything more exciting Following Caramons directions they headed east passing through two more sets of golden double doors and came to a large circular room A tall slimecoated pedestal stood in the centerso tall not even Riverwind could see what if anything was on it Tas stood beneath it staring up at it wistfully I tried to climb it last night he said but it was too slippery I wonder whats up there Well whatever it is will have to stay forever beyond the reach of kenders Tanis snapped irritably He walked over to investigate the staircase that spiraled down into the darkness The stairs were broken and covered with rotting plants and fungus The Paths of the Dead Raistlin said suddenly What Tanis started The Paths of the Dead the mage repeated Thats what this staircase is called How in the name of Reorx do you know that Flint growled I have read something of this city Raistlin replied in his whispering voice This is the first weve heard of it Sturm said coldly What else do you know that you havent told us A great many things knight Raistlin returned scowling While you and my brother played with wooden swords I spent my time in study Yes study of that which is dark and mysterious the knight sneered What really happened in the Towers of High Sorcery Raistlin You didnt gain these wonderful powers of yours without giving something in return What did you sacrifice in that Tower Your healthor your soul I was with my brother in the Tower Caramon said the warriors normally cheerful face now haggard I saw him battle powerful mages and wizards with only a few simple spells He defeated them though they shattered his body I carried him dying from the terrible place And I The big man hesitated Raistlin stepped forward quickly and placed his cold thin hand on his twins arm Be careful what you say he hissed Caramon drew a ragged breath and swallowed I know what he sacrificed the warrior said in a husky voice Then he lifted his head proudly We are forbidden to speak of it But you have known me many years Sturm Brightblade and I give you my word of honoryou may trust my brother as you trust me If ever a time comes when that is not so may my death and hisbe not far behind Raistlins eyes narrowed at this vow He regarded his brother with a thoughtful somber expression Then Tanis saw the mages lip curl the serious mien wiped out by his customary cynicism It was a startling change For a moment the twins resemblance to each other had been remarkable Now they were as different as opposite sides of a coin Sturm stepped forward and clasped Caramons hand gripping it tightly wordlessly Then he turned to face Raistlin unable to regard him without obvious disgust I apologize Raistlin the knight said stiffly You should be thankful you have such a loyal brother Oh I am Raistlin whispered Tanis glanced at the mage sharply wondering if he had only imagined sarcasm in the mages hissing voice The halfelf licked his dry lips a sudden bitter taste in his mouth Can you guide us through this place he asked abruptly I could have Raistlin answered if we had come here prior to the Cataclysm The books I studied dated back hundreds of years During the Cataclysm when the fiery mountain struck Krynn the city of Xak Tsaroth was cast down the side of a cliff I recognize this staircase because it is still intact As for beyond He shrugged Where do the stairs lead To a place known as the Hall of the Ancestors Priests and kings of Xak Tsaroth were buried in crypts there Lets get moving Caramon said gruffly All were doing here is scaring ourselves Yes Raistlin nodded We must go and go quickly We have until nightfall By tomorrow this city will be overrun by the armies moving from the north Bah Sturm frowned You may know lots of things as you claim mage but you cant know that Caramon is right thoughwe have stayed here too long I will take the lead He started down the stairs moving carefully to keep from slipping on the slimy surface Tanis saw Raistlins eyesnarrow golden slits of enmityfollow Stunn down Raistlin go with him and light the way Tanis ordered ignoring the angry glance Sturm flashed up at him Caramon walk with Goldmoon Riverwind and I will take rear guard And where does that leave us Flint grumbled to the kender as they followed behind Goldmoon and Caramon In the middle as usual Just more useless baggage There might be anything up there Tas said looking back to the pedestal He obviously hadnt heard a word of what had been said A crystal ball of farseeing a magic ring like I once had Did I ever tell you about my magic ring Flint groaned Tanis heard the kenders voice prattling on as the two disappeared down the stairs The halfelf turned to Riverwind You were hereyou must have been We have seen the goddess who gave you the staff Did you come down here I dont know Riverwind said wearily I remember nothing about it Nothingexcept the dragon Tanis fell silent The dragon It all came down to the dragon The creature loomed large in everyones thoughts And how feeble the small group seemed against a monster who had sprung full grown from Krynns darkest legends Why us Tanis thought bitterly Was there ever a more unlikely group of heroesbickering grumbling arguinghalf of us not trusting the other half We were chosen That thought brought little comfort Tanis remembered Raistlins words Who chose usand why The halfelf was beginning to wonder They moved silently down the steep stairway that curled ever deeper into the hillside At first it was intensely dark as they spiraled down Then the way began to get lighter until Raistlin was able to extinguish the light on his staff Soon Sturm raised his hand halting the others behind him Beyond stretched a short corridor no more than a few feet long This led to a large arched doorway that revealed a vast open area A pale gray light filtered into the corridor as did the odor of dankness and decay The companions stood for long moments listening carefully The sound of rushing water seemed to come from below and beyond the door nearly drowning out all other sounds Still Tanis thought he had heard something elsea sharp crack and he had felt more than heard a thumping and throbbing on the floor But it didnt last long and the sharp crack wasnt repeated Then more puzzling still came a metallic scraping sound punctuated by an occasional shrill screech Tanis glanced at Tasslehoff questioningly The kender shrugged I havent a clue he said cocking his head and listening closely Ive never heard anything like it Tanis except once He paused then shook his head Do you want me to go look he asked eagerly Go Tasslehoff crept down the short corridor flitting from shadow to shadow A mouse running across thick carpet makes more noise than a kender when he wants to escape notice He reached the door and peered out Ahead of him stretched what must once have been a vast ceremonial hall Hall of the Ancestors thats what Raistlin called it Now it was a Hall of Ruins Part of the floor to the east had fallen into a hole from which a foulsmelling white mist boiled up Tas noticed other huge holes gaping in the floor while chunks of large stone tile stuck up like grave markers Carefully testing the floor beneath his feet the kender stepped out into the hall Through the mist he could faintly distinguish a dark doorway on the south wall and another on the north The strange screeching sound came from the south Tas turned and began walking in that direction He suddenly heard the thumping and throbbing sound again to the north behind him and felt the floor start to tremble The kender hurriedly dashed back into the stairwell His friends had heard the sound and were flattened against the wall weapons in hand The thumping sound grew into a loud whoosh Then ten or fifteen squat shadowy figures rushed past the arched doorway The floor shook They heard hard breathing and an occasional muttered word Then the figures vanished in the mist heading south There was another sharp cracking sound then silence What in the name of the Abyss was that Caramon exclaimed Those werent draconians unless theyve come up with a short fat breed And whered they come from They came from the north end of the hall Tas said Theres a doorway there and one to the south The weird screeching sounds come from the south where those things were headed Whats east Tanis asked Judging by the sound of falling water I could hear about a thousandfoot drop the kender replied The floors caved in I wouldnt recommend walking over there Flint sniffed I smell something something familiar I cant place it I smell death Goldmoon said shivering holding her staff close Naw this is something worse Flint muttered Then his eyes opened wide and his face grew red with rage and anger Ive got it he roared Gully dwarf He unslung his axe Thats what those miserable little things were Well the wont be gully dwarves for long Theyll be stinking corpses He dashed forward Tanis Sturm and Caramon leaped after him just as he reached the end of the corridor and dragged him back Keep quiet Tanis ordered the sputtering dwarf Now how sure are you that they are gully dwarves The dwarf angrily shook himself from Caramons grasp Sure he started to roar then dropped it to a loud whisper Didnt they hold me prisoner for three years Did they Tanis asked startled Thats why I never told you where I was these last five years the dwarf said flushing with embarrassment His face darkened But I swore Id get revenge Ill kill every living gully dwarf I come across Wait a minute Sturm interrupted Gully dwarves arent evilnot like goblins at any rate What could they be doing living here with draconians Slaves Raistlin answered coolly Undoubtedly the gully dwarves have lived here many years probably ever since the city was abandoned When the draconians were sent perhaps to guard the Disks they found the gully dwarves and used them as slave labor They might be able to help us then Tanis murmured Gully dwarves Flint exploded Youd trust those filthy little No Tanis said We cannot trust them of course But nearly every slave is willing to betray his master and gully dwarveslike most dwarvesfeel little loyalty to anyone except their own chieftains As long as we dont ask them to do anything that might endanger their own dirty skins we might be able to buy their aid Well ill be an ogres hind end Flint said in disgust He hurled his axe to the ground tore his pack off and slumped down against the wall arms folded Go on Go ask your new friends to help you Ill not be with you Theyll help you all right Help you right up the dragons snout Tanis and Sturm exchanged concerned glances remembering the boat incident Flint could be incredibly stubborn and Tanis thought it quite likely that this time the dwarf would prove immovable I dunno Caramon sighed and shook his head Its too bad the dwarfs staying behind If we do get the gully dwarves to help us wholl keep the scum in line Amazed that Caramon could be so subtle Tanis smiled and picked up on the warriors lead Sturm I guess Sturm The dwarf bounded to his feet A knight who wont stab an enemy in the back You need someone who knows these foul creatures Youre right Flint Tanis said gravely I guess youll have to come with us You bet Flint grumbled He grabbed his things and stumped off down the corridor He turned around You coming Hiding their smiles the companions followed the dwarf out into the Hall of the Ancestors They kept close to the wall avoiding the treacherous floor They headed south following the gully dwarves and entered a dimly lit passage that ran south only a few hundred feet then turned sharply east Once again they heard the cracking noise The metallic screeching had stopped Suddenly they heard behind them the sound of pounding feet Gully dwarves growled Flint Back Tanis ordered Be ready to jump them We cant let them raise an alarm Everyone flattened himself against the wall sword drawn and ready Flint held his battleaxe a look of eager anticipation on his face Staring back into the vast hall they saw another group of short fat figures running toward them Suddenly the leader of the gully dwarves looked up and saw them Caramon leaped out in front of the small running figures his huge arm raised commandingly Halt he said The gully dwarves glanced up at him swarmed around him and disappeared around the corner to the east Caramon turned around to stare after them in astonishment Halt he said halfheartedly A gully dwarf popped back around the corner glared at Caramon and put a grubby finger to his lips Shhhhh Then the squat figure vanished They heard the cracking sound and the screeching noise started up again What do you suppose is going on Tanis asked softly Do they all look like that Goldmoon said her eyes wide Theyre so filthy and ragged and there are sores all over their bodies And they have the brains of a doorknob Flint grunted The group cautiously rounded the comer hands on their weapons A long narrow corridor extended east lit by torches that flickered and smoked in the stifling air The light reflected off walls wet with condensed moisture Arched doorways revealing only blackness opened up off the hallway The crypts Raistlin whispered Tanis shivered Water dripped on him from the ceiling The metallic screeching was louder and nearer Goldmoon touched the halfelfs arm and pointed Tanis saw down at the far end of the corridor a doorway Beyond the opening was another passageway forming a Tintersection The corridor was filled with gully dwarves I wonder why the little guys are lined up Caramon said This is our chance to find out Tanis said He was starting forward when he felt the mages hand on his arm Leave this to me Raistlin whispered We had better come with you Sturm stated to cover you of course Of course Raistlin sniffed Very well but do not disturb me Tanis nodded Flint you and Riverwind guard this end of the corridor Flint opened his mouth to protest then scowled and fell back to stand opposite the Plainsmen Stay well behind me Raistlin ordered then moved down the corridor his red robes rustling around his ankles the Staff of Magius thumping softly on the floor at each step Tanis and Sturm followed moving along the side of the dripping walls Cold air flowed from the crypts Peering inside one Tanis could see the dark outline of a sarcophagus reflected in the sputtering torchlight The coffin was elaborately carved decorated with gold that shone no longer An oppressive air hung over the crypts Some of the tombs appeared to have been broken into and plundered Tanis caught a glimpse of a skull grinning out of the darkness He wondered if these ancient dead were planning their revenge for having their rest disturbed Tanis forced himself to return to reality It was bleak enough Raistlin stopped when he neared the end of the corridor The gully dwarves watched him curiously ignoring the others behind him The mage did not speak He reached into a pouch on his belt and drew out several golden coins The gully dwarves eyes brightened One or two at the front of the line edged toward Raistlin to get a better view The mage held up a coin so they all could see it Then he threw it high into the air and it vanished The gully dwarves gasped Raistlin opened his hand with a flourish to reveal the coin There was scattered applause The gully dwarves crept closer mouths gaping in wonder Gully dwarvesor Aghar as their race was knownwere truly a miserable lot The lowest caste in dwarven society they were to be found all over Krynn living in filth and squalor in places that had been abandoned by most other living creatures including animals Like all dwarves they were clannish and several clans often lived together following the rule of their chieftains or one particularly powerful clan leader Three clans lived in Xak Tsaroththe Sluds the Bulps and the Glups Members of all three clans now surrounded Raistlin There were both males and females though it was not easy to tell the sexes apart The females lacked whiskers on their chins but had them on their cheeks They wore a tattered overskirt wrapped around their waists extending to their bony knees Otherwise they were every bit as ugly as their male counterparts Despite their wretched appearance gully dwarves generally led a cheerful existence Raistlin with marvelous dexterity made the coin dance over his knuckles flipping it in and out of his fingers Then he made it disappear only to reappear inside the ear of some startled gully dwarf who stared at the mage in amazement This last trick produced a momentary interruption in the performance as the Aghars friends grabbed him and peered intently into his ear one of them even sticking his finger inside to see if more coins might be forthcoming This interesting activity ceased though when Raistlin reached into another pouch and removed a small scroll of parchment Spreading it open with his long thin fingers the mage began to read from it chanting softly SuA tangus moipar ast akular kalipar The gully dwarves watched in total fascination When the mage finished reading the spiderylooking words on the scroll began to burn They flared then disappeared leaving traces of green smoke What was that all about Sturm asked suspiciously They are now spellbound Raistlin replied I have cast over them a spell of friendship The gully dwarves were enthralled and Tanis noticed the expressions on their faces had changed from interest to open unabashed affection for the mage They reached out and patted him with their dirty hands jabbering away in their shapeless language Sturm glanced at Tanis in alarm Tanis knew what the knight was thinking Raistlin could have cast that spell on any of them at any time Hearing the sound of running feet Tanis looked quickly back to where Riverwind stood guard The Plainsman pointed to the gully dwarves then held up his hands fingers spread Ten more were heading their way Soon the new Aghar trotted into view passing Riverwind without so much as a glance They pulled up short on seeing the commotion around the mage What happening said one staring at Raistlin The spellbound gully dwarves were gathered around the mage tugging on his robe and dragging him down the hall Friend This our friend they all chattered wildly in a crude form of Common Yes Raistlin said in a soft and gentle voice so smooth and winning that Tanis was momentarily taken aback You are all my friends the mage continued Now tell me my friends where does this corridor lead Raistlin pointed to the east There was an immediate babble of answers Corridor lead that way said one pointing east No it lead that way said another pointing west A scuffle broke out the gully dwarves pushing and shoving Soon fists were flying and then one gully dwarf had another on the ground kicking him yelling That way That way at the top of his lungs Sturm turned to Tanis This is ridiculous Theyll bring every draconian in the place down on us I dont know what that crazy magician has done but youve got to stop him Before Tanis could intervene however one female gully dwarf took matters into her own hands Dashing into the melee she grabbed the two combatants knocked their heads together smartly and dumped them on the floor The others who had been cheering them on immediately hushed and the newcomer turned to Raistlin She had a thick bulbous nose and her hair stood up wildly on her head She wore a patched and ragged dress thick shoes and stockings that collapsed around her ankles But she seemed to be a leader among the gully dwarves for they all eyed her with respect This may have been because she carried a huge heavy bag slung over one shoulder The bag dragged along the ground as she walked occasionally tripping her But the bag was apparently of great importance to her When one of the other gully dwarves attempted to touch it she whirled around and smacked him across the face Corridor lead to big bosses she said nodding her head toward the east Thank you my dear Raistlin said reaching out to touch her cheek He spoke a few words Tantago musalah The female gully dwarf watched fascinated as he spoke Then she sighed and gazed up at him in adoration Tell me little one Raistlin said How many bosses The gully dwarf frowned concentrating She raised a grubby hand One she said holding up one finger And one and one and one Looking up at Raistlin triumphantly she held up four fingers and said Two Im beginning to agree with Flint Sturm growled Shhhh Tanis said Just then the screeching noise stopped The gully dwarves looked down the corridor uneasily as into the silence came the harsh cracking sound again What is that noise Raistlin asked his spellbound adorer Whip the female gully dwarf said emotionlessly Reaching out her filthy hand she took hold of Raistlins robe and started to pull him toward the east end of the corridor Bosses get mad We go What is it you do for the bosses Raistlin asked holding back We go You see The gully dwarf tugged on him We down They up Down Up Down Up Come You go We give ride down Raistlin being carried along on a tide of Aghar looked back at Tanis motioning with his hand Tanis signaled to Riverwind and Flint and everyone started moving down the hall behind the gully dwarves Those Raistlin had charmed remained clustered around him trying to stay as close as possible while the rest ran off down the corridor when the whip cracked again The companions followed Raistlin and the gully dwarves down to the comer where the screeching noise started up once again much louder now The female gully dwarf brightened as she heard it She and the rest of the gully dwarves halted Some of them slouched against the slimecovered walls others plopped on the floor like sacks The female stayed near Raistlin holding the hem of his sleeve in her small hand What is it he asked Why have we stopped We wait Not our turn yet she informed him What will we do when it is our turn he asked patiently Go down she said staring up at him adoringly Raistlin looked at Tanis shook his head The mage decided to try a new approach What is your name little one he asked Bupu Caramon snorted and quickly clapped his hand over his mouth Now Bupu Raistlin said in dulcet tones do you know where the dragons lair is Dragon Bupu repeated astounded You want dragon No Raistlin said hastily we dont want the dragonjust the dragons lair where the dragon lives Oh me not know that Bupu shook her head Then seeing disappointment on Raistlins face she clutched his hand But me take you to the great Highbulp He know everything Raistlin raised his eyebrows And how do we get to the Highbulp Down she said grinning happily The screeching sound stopped There was a crack of a whip It our turn to go down now You come You come now Go see Highbulp Just a moment Raistlin extricated himself from the gully dwarfs grasp I must talk to my friends He walked over to Tanis and Sturm This Highbulp is probably head of the clan maybe head of several clans If hes as intelligent as this lot he wont know where his own wash bowl is let alone the dragon Sturm growled Hell know most likely Flint spoke up grudgingly Theyre not smart but gully dwarves remember everything they see or hear if you can just get them to put it into words of more than one syllable We better go see the great Highbulp then Tanis said ruefully Now if we could just figure out what this up and down business is and that squeaking noise I know said a voice Tanis looked around He had completely forgotten about Tasslehoff The kender came running back in from around the comer his topknot dancing eyes shining with merriment Its a lift Tanis he said Like in dwarven mines I was in a mine once It was the most wonderful thing They had a lift that took rock up and down And this is just like it Well almost like it You see He was suddenly overcome with giggles and couldnt go on The rest glaring at him the kender made a violent effort to control himself Theyre using a giant lardrendering pot The gully dwarves that have been standing in line here run out when one of the dracothingamajiggers cracks this big whip They all jump into the pot thats attached to a huge chain wrapped around a spoked wheel with teeth that fit into the links of the chain thats whats squeaking The wheel turns and down they go and pretty soon up comes another pot Big bosses Pot full of big bosses Bupu said Filled with draconians Tanis repeated in alarm Not come here Bupu said Go that way She waved a hand vaguely Tanis remained uneasy So these are the bosses How many draconians are there by the pot Two said Bupu holding Raistlins sleeve securely Not more than two Actually there are four Tas said with an apologetic glance for contradicting the gully dwarf Theyre the little ones not the big ones that cast spells Four Caramon flexed his huge arms We can handle four Yes but weve got to time it so that fifteen more arent arriving Tanis pointed out The whip cracked again Come Bupu tugged urgently on Raistlins sleeve We go Bosses get mad Id say this is as good a time as any Sturm said shrugging Let the gully dwarves run as usual Well follow and overwhelm the bosses in the confusion If one pot is up here waiting to be loaded with gully dwarves the other has to be on the ground level I suppose Tanis said He turned to the gully dwarves When you get to the lifter potdont jump in Just dodge aside and keep out of the way All right The gully dwarves stared at Tanis with deep suspicion The halfelf sighed and looked at Raistlin Smiling slightly the mage repeated Taniss instructions Immediately the gully dwarves began to smile and nod enthusiastically The whip cracked again and the companions heard a harsh voice Quit loafing you scum or well chop your nasty feet off and give you an excuse for being slow Well see whose feet get chopped off Caramon said This be some fun said one of the gully dwarves solemnly The Aghar dashed down the corridor Fight at the lift Bupus cure for a cough A lot mist rose from two large holes in the floor swirling around whatever was nearby Between the two holes was a large wheel around which ran a gigantic chain A tremendous black iron pot hung suspended from the chain over one of the holes The other end of the chain disappeared through the other hole Four armorclad draconians two of them swinging leather whips and armed with curved swords stood around the pot They were visible only briefly then mist hid them from view Tanis could hear the whip crack and a guttural voice bellowing You louseridden dwarf vermin Whatre you doing holding back there Get into this pot before I flay the filthy flesh from your nasty bones Iulp The draconian stopped in midsentence its eyes bulging out of its reptilian head as Caramon emerged from the mist roaring his battlecry The draconian let out a yell that changed into a choking gurgle as Caramon grabbed the creature around its scrawny neck lifted it off its clawed feet and hurled it back against the wall Gully dwarves scattered as the body hit the wall with a bonecrushing thump Even as Caramon attacked Sturmswinging his great twohanded swordyelled out the knights salute to an enemy and lopped the head off a draconian who never saw what was coming The severed head rolled on the floor with a crunching sound as it changed to stone Unlike goblins who attack anything that moves without strategy or thought draconians are intelligent and quickthinking The two remaining by the pot had no intention of taking on five skilled and wellarmed warriors One of them immediately jumped into the pot yelling instructions to its companion in their guttural language The other draconian dashed over to the wheel and freed the mechanism The pot began to drop through the hole Stop it Tanis yelled Its going for reinforcements Wrong shouted Tasslehoff peering over the edge The reinforcements are already on the way up in the other pot There must be twenty of them Caramon ran to stop the draconian operating the lift but he was too late The creature left the mechanism turning and dashed toward the pot With a great bound it leaped in after its companion Caramon on the principle of dont let the enemy get away jumped right into the pot after it The gully dwarves cheered and hooted some dashing over to the edge to get a better view That big idiot Sturm swore Shoving gully dwarves aside to look down he saw swinging fists and flashing armor as Caramon and the draconians flailed away at each other Caramons added weight caused the pot to fall faster Theyll cut the lummox to jerky down there Sturm muttered Im going after him he yelled to Tanis Launching himself into the air he grabbed hold of the chain and slid right down it into the pot Now weve lost both of them Tanis groaned Flint come with me Riverwind stay up here with Raistlin and Goldmoon See if you can reverse that damned wheel No Tas not you Too late The Render screaming enthusiastically leaped onto the chain and began shinnying down Tanis and Flint jumped into the hole too Tanis wrapped his arms and legs around the chain hanging on just above the kender but the dwarf missed his hold landing in the pot helmet first Caramon promptly stepped on him The draconians in the pot pinned the warrior against the side He punched one sending it slamming to the other side and drew his dagger on the other as it fumbled for its sword Caramon stabbed before the draconian could get the sword free but the warriors dagger glanced off the creatures armor and was jarred out of Caramons grasp The draconian went for his face trying to gouge his eyes out with its clawed hands Grabbing the draconians wrists in a crushing grip Caramon succeeded in wrenching its hands away from his face The two powerful beingshuman and draconian struggled against the side of the pot The other draconian recovered from Caramons blow and seized its sword But its dive for the warrior came to an abrupt halt when Sturm sliding down the chain kicked it hard in the face with his heavy boot The draconian reeled backwards the sword flying from its grasp Sturm leaped and tried to club the creature with the flat of his sword but the draconian thrust the blade aside with its hands Get off me Flint roared from the bottom of the pot Blinded by his helm he was being slowly crushed by Caramons big feet In a spurt of ferocious anger the dwarf straightened his helm then heaved himself up causing Caramon to lose his footing and tumble forward into the draconian The creature sidestepped while Caramon staggered into the huge chain The draconian swung its sword wildly Caramon ducked and the sword clanged uselessly against the chain notching the blade Flint hurled himself at the draconian hitting it squarely in the stomach with his head The two fell against the side The pot gained momentum swirling the foul mists around them Keeping his eyes on the action below Tanis lowered himself down the chain Stay put he snarled at Tasslehoff Letting go his grip Tanis dropped down and landed in the midst of the melee Tas disappointed but reluctant to disobey Tanis clung to the chain with one hand while he reached into his pouch and pulled out a rock ready to drop iton the head of an enemy he hoped The pot began to sway as the combatants fell against the sides in their struggles all the while dropping lower and lower causing the other potfilled with screaming and cursing draconiansto rise higher and higher Riverwind standing at the hole with the gully dwarves could see very little through the mist He could however hear thumps and curses and groans from the pot holding his friends Then out of the mist rose the other pot Draconians stood swords in their hands staring openmouthed up at him their long red tongues panting in anticipation In moments he and Goldmoon Raistlin and fifteen gully dwarves would be facing about twenty angry draconians He spun around stumbled over a gully dwarf regained his balance and ran to the mechanism Somehow he had to stop that pot from rising The huge wheel was turning slowly the chain screeching through the spokes Riverwind stared at it with the idea of grabbing the chain in his bare hands A flurry of red shoved him aside Raistlin watched the wheel for an instant timing its rotation then he jammed the Staff of Magius in between the wheel and the floor The staff shivered for an instant and Riverwind held his breath fearing the staff would snap But it held The mechanism shuddered to a stop Riverwind Goldmoon yelled from where she had remained by the hole The Plainsman ran over to the edge Raistlin following The gully dwarves lined up around the hole were having a wonderful time thoroughly enjoying one of the most interesting events to occur in their lives Only Bupu moved away from the edgeshe trotted after Raistlin grasping his robe whenever possible Kharkumatrbreathed Riverwind as he looked down into the swirling mist Caramon tossed overboard the draconian he had been fighting It fell with a shriek into the mist The big warrior had claw marks on his face and a sword slash on his right arm Sturm Tanis and Flint still battled the second draconian who seemed willing to kill regardless of the consequences When it finally became clear that hitting was not enough Tanis stabbed it with his dagger The creature sank down immediately turning to rock holding Taniss weapon fast in its stony corpse Then the pot lurched to a halt jolting everyone Look out Neighbors yelled Tasslehoff dropping off the chain Tanis looked over to see the other pot filled with draconians swinging only about twenty feet away Armed to the teeth the draconians were preparing a boarding maneuver Two clambered up onto the edge of the pot ready to leap across the misty gap Caramon leaned over the edge of the pot and made a wild and vicious swing with his sword in an attempt to slash one of the boarders He missed and the momentum of his swing set the pot rotating on its chain Caramon lost his balance and fell forward his great weight tipping the pot dangerously He found himself staring directly down at the ground far below him Sturm grabbed hold of Caramons collar and yanked him back causing the pot to rock erratically Tanis slipped landing on his hands and knees at the bottom of the pot where he discovered that the stone draconian had decayed into dust allowing him to retrieve his dagger Here they come Flint yelled hauling Tanis to his feet One draconian launched itself toward them and caught hold of the edge of the pot with its clawed hands The pot tilted precariously once again Get over there Tanis shoved Caramon to the opposite side hoping the warriors weight would keep the pot stable Sturm hacked at the draconians hands trying to force it to let go Then another draconian flew over gauging its distance better than the first It landed in the pot next to Sturm Dont move Tanis screamed at Caramon as the warrior instinctively charged into combat The pot tilted The big man quickly returned to his position The pot righted itself The draconian hanging onto the edge its fingers oozing green let go spread its wings and floated down into the mist Tanis spun around to fight the draconian that had landed in the pot and fell over Flint knocking the dwarf off his feet again The halfelf staggered against the side As the pot rocked he stared down The mists parted and he saw the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth far below him When he drew back feeling sick and disoriented he saw Tasslehoff fighting the draconian The little kender crawled up the creatures back and bashed it on the head with a rock At the bottom of the pot Flint picked up Caramons dropped dagger and stabbed the same creature in the leg The draconian screamed as the blade bit deep Knowing more draconians were about to fly over Tanis looked up in despair But the despair turned to hope when he saw Riverwind and Goldmoon staring down through the mist Bring us back up Tanis yelled frantically then something hit him on the head The pain was excruciating He felt himself falling and falling and falling Raistlin did not hear Taniss yellthe mage had already gone into action Come here my friends Raistlin said swiftly The spellbound gully dwarves gathered eagerly around him Those bosses down there want to hurt me he said softly The gully dwarves growled Several frowned darkly A few shook their fists at the potful of draconians But you can help Raistlin said You can stop them The gully dwarves stared at the mage dubiously Friendshipafter allwent only so far All you must do Raistlin said patiently is run over and jump on that chain He pointed at the chain attached to the draconians pot The gully dwarves faces brightened That didnt sound bad In fact it was something they did almost daily when they missed catching hold of the pot Raistlin waved his arm Go he ordered The gully dwarvesall except Bupuglanced at each other then dashed to the edge of the hole and yelling wildly flung themselves onto the chain above the draconians clinging to it with marvelous dexterity The mage ran over to the wheel Bupu trotting along after him Grabbing the Staff of Magius he tugged it free The wheel shivered and began to move once again turning more and more rapidly as the weight of the gully dwarves caused the draconian pot to plummet back down into the mists Several of the draconians who had been perched on the edge about to jump into the other pot were caught off guard by the sudden jolt They lost their balance and fell Though their wings stopped their fall they shrieked in rage as they drifted to the ground below their cries contrasting oddly with the gleeful shouts of the gully dwarves Riverwind leaned out over the edge of the hole and caught hold of the companions pot as it reached the wheel Are you all right Goldmoon asked anxiously leaning over to help Caramon out Tanis is hurt Caramon said supporting the halfelf Its just a bump Tanis protested groggily He felt a large lump rising on the back of his skull I thought I was falling out of that thing He shuddered at the memory We cant get down that way Sturm said climbing out of the pot And we cant stay around up here It wont take them long to get this lift back in operation and then theyll be after us Well have to go back No Dont go Bupu clutched at Raistlin I know way to Highbulp She tugged at his sleeve pointing north Good way Secret way No bosses she said softly stroking his hand I not let bosses get you You pretty We dont seem to have much choice Weve got to get down there Tanis said wincing when Goldmoons staff touched him Then the healing power flowed through his body He relaxed as the pain eased and sighed As you said theyve lived here for years Flint growled and shook his head as Bupu started down the corridor heading north Stop Listen Tasslehoff called softly They heard the sound of clawed feet coming toward them Draconians said Sturm Weve got to get out of here Head back west I knew it Flint grumbled scowling That gully dwarfs led us right into those lizards Wait Goldmoon gripped Taniss arm Look at her The halfelf turned to see Bupu remove something limp and shapeless from the bag she carried over her shoulder Stepping up to the wall she waved the thing in front of the stone slab and muttered a few words The wall shivered and within seconds a doorway appeared leading into darkness The companions exchanged uneasy glances No choice Tanis muttered The rattle and clank of armored draconians could be heard clearly marching down the corridor toward them Raistlin light he ordered The mage spoke and the crystal on his staff flared He and Bupu and Tanis quickly passed through the secret door The rest followed and the other door slid shut behind them The mages staff revealed a small square room decorated with wall carvings so covered with green slime that they were impossible to distinguish They stood in silence as they heard draconians pass in the corridor They must have heard the fight Sturm whispered It wont take them long to get the lift in motion then well have the whole draconian force after us I know way down Bupu waved her hand deprecatingly No worry How did you open the door little one Raistlin asked curiously kneeling beside Bupu Magic she said shyly and she held out her hand Lying in the gully dwarfs grubby palm was a dead rat its teeth fixed in a permanent grimace Raistlin raised his eyebrows then Tasslehoff touched his arm Its not magic Raistlin the kender whispered Its a simple hidden floor lock I saw it when she pointed at the wall and I was about to say something when she went through this magic rigmarole She steps on it when she gets close to the door and waves that thing The kender giggled She probably tripped it once accidentally while carrying the rat Bupu gave the kender a scathing glance Magic she stated pouting and stroking the rat lovingly She popped it back into her bag and said Come you go She led them north passing through broken slimecoated rooms Finally she came to a halt in a room filled with rock dust and debris Part of the ceiling had collapsed and the floor was littered with broken tiles The gully dwarf jabbered and pointed at something in the northeast coner of the room Go down she said Tanis and Raistlin walked over to inspect They found a fourfoot wide pipe one end sticking up out of the crumbling floor Apparently it had fallen through the ceiling caving in the northeast section of the room Raistlin thrust his staff down inside the pipe and peered inside Come you go Bupu said pointing and tugging at Raistlins sleeve urgently Bosses cant follow Thats probably true Tanis said Not with their wings But theres not room enough to swing a sword Sturm said frowning I dont like it Suddenly everyone stopped talking They heard the wheel creak and the chain start to screech The companions looked at each other Me first Tasslehoff grinned Poking his head in the pipe he crawled forward on his hands and knees Are you sure Ill fit Caramon asked staring at the opening anxiously Dont worry Tass voice floated out Its so slick with slime youll slip through like a greased pig This cheerful statement did not seem to impress Caramon He continued to regard the pipe gloomily as Raistlin led by Bupu clutched his robes around him and slid inside his staff lighting the way Flint climbed in next Goldmoon followed grimacing in disgust as her hands slipped in the thick green slime Riverwind slid in after her This is insaneI hope you know that Sturm muttered in disgust Tanis didnt answer He clapped Caramon on the back Your turn he said listening to the sound of the chain moving faster and faster Caramon groaned Getting down on his hands and knees the big warrior crawled forward into the pipe opening His sword hilt caught on the edge Backing out he fumbled to readjust the sword then he tried again This time his rump stuck up too far making his back scrape along the top Tanis planted his foot firmly on the big warriors rear end and shoved Flatten down the halfelf ordered Caramon collapsed like a wet sack with another groan He squirmed in head first shoving his shield in front of him his armor dragging along the metal pipe with a shrill scraping sound that set Taniss teeth on edge The halfelf reached out and grasped the top of the pipe Thrusting his legs in first he began to slide in the foulsmelling slime He twisted his head around to look back at Sturm who came last Sanity ended when we followed Tika into the kitchen of the Inn of the Last Home he said True enough the knight agreed with a sigh Tasslehoff enthralled by the new experience of crawling down the pipe suddenly saw dark figures at the bottom end Scrabbling for a handhold he slid to a stop Raistlin the kender whispered Somethings coming up the pipe What is it the mage started to ask but the foul moist air caught in his throat and he began to cough Trying to catch his breath he shone the staffs light down the pipe to see who approached Bupu took one look and sniffed Gulppulphers she muttered Waving her hand she shouted Go back Go back We go upride lift Big bosses get mad yelled one We go down See Highbulp Bupu said importantly At this the other gully dwarves began backing down muttering and swearing But Raistlin couldnt move for a moment He clutched his chest hacking the sound echoing alarmingly in the stillness of the narrow pipe Bupu gazed at him anxiously then thrust her small hand into her bag fished around for several moments and came up with an object that she held up to the light She squinted at it then sighed and shook her head This not what I want she mumbled Tasslehoff catching sight of a brilliant colorful flash crept closer What is that he asked even though he knew the answer Raistlin too was staring at the object with wide glittering eyes Bupu shrugged Pretty rock she said without interest searching through the bag once more An emerald Raistlin wheezed Bupu glanced up You like she asked Raistlin Very much The mage gasped You keep Bupu put the jewel in the mages hand Then with a cry of triumph she brought out what she had been searching for Tas leaning up close to see the new wonder drew back in disgust It was a deadvery deadlizard There was a piece of chewedon leather cord tied around the lizards stiff tail Bupu held it toward Raistlin You wear around neck she said Cure cough The mage accustomed to handling much more unpleasant objects than this smiled at Bupu and thanked her but declined the cure assuring her that his cough was much improved She looked at him dubiously but he did seem betterthe spasm had passed After a moment she shrugged and put the lizard back into her bag Raistlin examining the emerald with expert eyes stared coldly at Tasslehoff The kender sighing turned his back and continued down the pipe Raistlin slipped the stone into one of the secret inner pockets sewn into his robes When a branch pipe joined theirs Tas looked questioningly at the gully dwarf Bupu hesitantly pointed south into the new pipe Tas entered slowly This is stee he gasped as he began to slide rapidly down He tried to slow his descent but the slime was too thick Caramons explosive oath echoing down the pipe from behind him told the kender that his companions were having the same problem Suddenly Tas saw light ahead of him The tunnel was coming to an endbut where Tas had a vivid vision of bursting out five hundred feet above nothing But there wasnt anything he could do to stop himself The light grew brighter and Tasslehoff shot out the end of the pipe with a small shriek Raistlin slid out of the pipe nearly falling on Bupu The mage looking around thought for an instant that he had tumbled into a fire Great billowing clouds of white rolled around the room Raistlin began to cough and gasp for breath Wha Flint flew out of the end of the pipe falling on his hands and knees He peered through the cloud Poison He gasped crawling over to the mage Raistlin shook his head but he couldnt answer Bupu clutched the mage dragging him toward the door Goldmoon slid out on her stomach knocking the breath from her body Riverwind tumbled out twisting his body to avoid hitting Goldmoon There was a clanging bang as Caramons shield shot from the pipe Caramons spiked armor and broad girth had slowed him enough so that he was able to crawl out of the pipe But he was bruised and battered and covered with green filth By the time Tanis arrived everyone was gagging in the powdery atmosphere What in the name of the Abyss Tanis said astonished then promptly choked as he inhaled a lungful of the white stuff Get out of here he croaked Wheres that gully dwarf Bupu appeared in the doorway She had taken Raistlin out of the room and was now motioning to the others They emerged thankfully into the unclouded air and slumped down to rest among the ruins of a street Tanis hoped they werent waiting for an army of draconians Suddenly he looked up Wheres Tas he asked in alarm staggering to his feet Here I am said a choked and miserable voice Tanis whirled around Tasslehoffat least Tanis presumed it was Tasslehoffstood before him The kender was covered from topknot to toes in a thick white pasty substance All Tanis could see of him were two brown eyes blinking out of a white mask What happened the halfelf asked He had never seen anyone quite so miserable as the bedraggled kender Tasslehoff didnt answer He just pointed back inside Tanis fearing something disastrous ran over and peered cautiously through the crumbling doorway The white cloud had dissipated so that he could see around the room now Over in one cornerdirectly opposite the pipe openingstood a number of large bulging sacks Two of them had been split open spilling a mass of white onto the floor Then Tanis understood He put his hand over his face to hide his smile Flour he murmured One broken city Highbulp Phudge I the Great The night of the Cataclysm had been a night of horror for the city of Xak Tsaroth When the fiery mountain struck Krynn the land split apart The ancient and beautiful city of Xak Tsaroth slid down the face of a cliff into a vast cavern formed by the huge rents in the ground Thus underground it was lost to the sight of men and most people believed the city had vanished entirely swallowed up by Newsea But it still existed clinging to the rough sides of the cavern walls spread out upon the floor of the cavernthere were ruined buildings on several different levels The building the companions had fallen into which Tanis assumed must have been a bakery was on the middle level caught by rocks and held up against the sheer cliff face Water from underground streams flowed down the sides of the rock and ran into the street swirling among the ruins Taniss gaze followed the course of the water It ran down the middle of the cracked cobblestone street running past other small shops and houses where people had once lived and gone about their business When the city fell the tall buildings that once lined the street toppled against one another forming a crude archway of broken marble slabs above the cobblestones Doors and broken shop windows yawned into the street All was still and quiet except for the noise of the dripping water The air was heavy with the odor of decay It weighed upon the spirit And though the air was warmer down beneath the ground level than up above the gloomy atmosphere chilled the blood No one spoke They washed the slime from their bodies and the flour from Tas as best they could then refilled their water skins Sturm and Caramon searched the area but saw no draconians After a few moments of rest the companions rose and moved on Bupu led them south down the street beneath the archway of ruined buildings The street opened into a plazahere the water in the streets became a river flowing west Follow river Bupu pointed Tanis frowned hearing above the noise of the river another sound the crashing and roaring of a great waterfall But Bupu insisted so the heroes edged their way around the plaza river occasionally plunging ankle deep in the water Reaching the end of the street the companions discovered the waterfall The street dropped off into air and the river gushed out from between broken columns to fall nearly five hundred feet into the bottom of the cavern There rested the remainder of the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth They could see by the dim light that filtered through cracks in the cavern roof far above that the heart of the ancient city lay scattered about on the floor of the cavern in many states of decay Some of the buildings were almost completely intact Others however were nothing but rubble A chill fog created by the many waterfalls plunging down into the cavern hung over the city Most of the streets had become rivers which combined to flow into a deep abyss to the north Peering through the mists the companions could see the huge chain hanging only a few hundred feet away slightly north of their present position They realized that the lift raised and lowered people at least one thousand feet Where does the Highbulp live Tanis asked looking down into the dead city below him Bupu says he lives over thereRaistlin gesturedin those buildings on the western side of the cavern And who lives in the reconstructed buildings right below us Tanis asked Bosses Bupu replied scowling How many bosses One and one and one Bupu counted until she had used up all her fingers Two she said Not more than two Which could be anything from two hundred to two thousand Sturm muttered How do we get to see the Highwhoop Highbulp Bupu glared at him Highbulp Phudge I The great How do we get to him without the bosses catching us In answer Bupu pointed upward to the rising pot full of draconians Tanis looked blank glanced at Sturm who shrugged disgustedly Bupu sighed in exasperation and turned to Raistlin obviously considering the others incapable of understanding Bosses go up We go down she said Raistlin stared at the lift through the mist Then he nodded in understanding The draconians probably believe that we are trapped up there with no way to get down into the city If most of the draconians are up above that would allow us to move safely below All right Sturm said But how in the name of Istar do we get down Most of us cant fly Bupu spread her hands Vines she said Seeing everyones look of confusion the gully dwarf stumped over to the edge of the waterfall and pointed down Thick green vines hung over the edge of the rocky cliff like giant snakes The leaves on the vines were torn tattered and in some places stripped off entirely but the vines themselves appeared thick and tough even if they were slippery Goldmoon unusually pale crept toward the edge peered over and backed away hurriedly It was a fivehundredfoot drop straight down to a rubblestrewn cobblestone street Riverwind put his arm around her comfortingly Ive climbed worse Caramon said complacently Well I dont like it said Flint But anythings better than sliding down a sewer Grabbing hold of the vine he swung himself over the ledge and began to inch slowly down hand over hand Its not bad he shouted up Tasslehoff slid down a vine after Flint traveling rapidly and with such skill that he received a grunt of approbation from Bupu The gully dwarf turned to look at Raistlin pointing at his long flowing robes and frowning The mage smiled at her reassuringly Standing on the edge of the cliff he said softly Pveathrfall The crystal ball on top of his staff flared and Raistlin leaped off the edge of the cliff disappearing into the mist below Bupu shrieked Tanis caught her fearing the adoring gully dwarf might throw herself over Hell be fine the halfelf assured her feeling a flash of pity when he saw the look of genuine anguish on her face He is magi he said Magic You know Bupu obviously did not know because she stared at Tanis suspiciously threw her bag around her neck grabbed hold of a vine and began scrabbling down the slippery rock The rest of the companions were preparing to follow when Goldmoon whispered brokenly I cant Riverwind took her hands Kantoka he said softly it will be all right You heard what the dwarf said Just dont look down Goldmoon shook her head her chin quivering There must be another way she said stubbornly We will search for it Whats the problem Tanis asked We should hurry Shes afraid of heights Riverwind said Goldmoon shoved him away How dare you tell him that she shouted her face flushed with anger Riverwind stared at her coldly Why not he said his voice grating Hes not your subject You can let him know youre human that you have human frailties You have only one subject to impress now Chieftain and that is me If Riverwind had stabbed her he could have inflicted no more terrible pain The color drained from Goldmoons lips Her eyes grew wide and staring like the eyes of a corpse Please secure the staff on my back she said to Tanis Goldmoon he didnt mean he began Do as I command she ordered curtly her blue eyes blazing in anger Tanis sighing tied the staff to her back with a length of rope Goldmoon did not even glance at Riverwind When the staff was fastened tightly she started toward the edge of the cliff Sturm jumped in front of her Allow me to go down the vine ahead of you he said If you slip If I slip and fall youd fall with me The only thing wed accomplish would be to die together she snapped Leaning down she took a firm grip on the vine and swung herself over the edge Almost immediately her sweating hands slipped Taniss breath caught in his throat Sturm lunged forward though he knew there wasnt anything he could do Riverwind stood watching not a sign of emotion on his face Goldmoon clutched frantically at the vines and thick leaves She caught hold and clung to them tightly unable to breath unwilling to move She pressed her face against the wet leaves shuddering her eyes closed to block out the sight of the terrifying drop to the ground below Sturm went over the edge and climbed down to her Leave me alone Goldmoon said to him through clenched teeth She drew a trembling breath cast a proud defiant glance at Riverwind then began to lower herself down the vine Sturm stayed near her keeping an eye on her as he skillfully climbed down the cliff face Tanis standing next to Riverwind wanted to say something to the Plainsman but feared to do more harm Saying nothing therefore he went over the edge Riverwind followed silently The halfelf found the climb easy though he slipped the last few feet landing in an inch of water Raistlin he noticed was shivering with the cold his cough worsening in the damp air Several gully dwarves stood around the mage staring at him with admiring eyes Tanis wondered how long the charm spell would last Goldmoon leaned against the wall shaking She did not look at Riverwind as he reached the ground and moved away from her his face still expressionless Where are we Tanis shouted above the noise of the waterfall The mist was so thick he couldnt see anything except broken columns overgrown with vines and fungus Great Plaza that way Bupu urgently jabbed her grubby finger toward the west Come You follow Go see Highbulp She started off Tanis reached out his hand and caught hold of her dragging her to a stop She glared at him deeply offended The halfelf removed his hand Please Just listen a moment What about the dragon Wheres the dragon Bupus eyes widened You want dragon she asked No yelled Tanis We dont want the dragon But we need to know if the dragon comes into this part of the city He felt Sturms hand on his shoulder and gave up Forget it Never mind he said wearily Go on Bupu regarded Raistlin with deep sympathy for having to put up with these insane people then she took the mages hand and trotted off down the street to the west the other gully dwarves trailing along behind Halfdeafened by the thundering noise of the waterfall the companions waded after glancing about them uneasilydark windows loomed above them dark doorways threatened At each moment they expected scaly armored draconians to appear But the gully dwarves did not seem concerned They sloshed along the street keeping as close to Raistlin as possible and jabbering in their uncouth language Eventually the sounds of the waterfall faded in the distance The mist continued to swirl around them however and the silence of the dead city was oppressive Dark water gushed and gurgled past their feet along the cobblestone riverbed Suddenly the buildings came to an end and the street opened into a huge circular plaza Through the water they could see the remnants in the plaza of flagstone paving in an intricate sunburst design In the center of the plaza the river was joined by another stream rushing in from the north They formed a small whirlpool as the waters met and swirled before joining and continuing west between another group of tumbledown buildings Here light streamed into the plaza from a crack in the cavern roof hundreds of feet above illuminating the ghostly mists dancing off the surface of the water whenever the mists parted Other side Great Plaza Bupu pointed The companions came to a halt in the shadows of the ruined buildings All of them had the same thought The plaza was over one hundred feet across without a scrap of shelter Once they ventured out there would be no hiding Bupu trotting along without concern suddenly realized no one was following her except other gully dwarves She looked back irritated at the delay You comeHighbulp this way Look Goldmoon grasped Taniss arm On the other side of the great flagstone plaza were great tall marble columns that supported a stone roof The columns were cracked and shattered letting the roof sag The mists parted and Tanis caught a glimpse of a courtyard behind the columns Dark forms of tall domed buildings were visible beyond the courtyard Then the mists closed around them Though now sunk into degradation and ruin this structure must have once been the most magnificent in Xak Tsaroth The Royal Palace Raistlin confirmed coughing Shhhh Goldmoon shook Taniss arm Cant you see No wait The mists flowed in front of the pillars For a moment the companions could not see anything Then the fog swirled away The companions shrank back into the dark doorway The gully dwarves came to a skidding halt in the plaza and whirling around raced back to cower behind Raistlin Bupu peered at Tanis from under the mages sleeve That dragon she said You want It was the dragon Sleek and shining black her leathery wings folded at her side Khisanth slithered out from under the roof ducking her head to fit beneath the sagging stone facade Her clawed front feet clicked on the marble stairs as she stopped and stared into the floating mist with her bright red eyes Her back legs and heavy reptilian tail were not visible the dragons body extending thirty feet or more back into the courtyard A cringing draconian walked beside her the two apparently deep in conversation Khisanth was angry The draconian had brought her disturbing newsit was impossible that any of the strangers could have survived her attack at the well But now the captain of her guard reported strangers in the city Strangers who attacked her forces with skill and daring strangers bearing a brown staff whose description was known to every draconian serving in this part of the Ansalon continent I cannot believe this report None could have escaped me Khisanths voice was soft almost purring yet the draconian trembled as he heard it The staff was not with them I would have sensed its presence You say these intruders are still above in the upper chambers Are you certain The draconian gulped and nodded There is no way down royal one except the lift There are other ways you lizard Khisanth sneered These miserable gully dwarves crawl around the place like parasites The intruders have the staff and they are trying to get down into the city That means only one thingthey are after the Disks How could they have learned of them The dragon snaked her head around and up and down as if she could see those who threatened her plans through the blinding mists But the mists swirled past thicker than ever Khisanth snarled in irritation The staff That miserable staff Verminaard should have foreseen this with those clerical been destroyed But no he is busy with his war while I must rot here in this dank tomb of a city Khisanth gnawed a talon as she pondered You could destroy the Disks the draconian suggested greatly daring Fool dont you think weve tried Khisanth muttered She lifted her head No it is far too dangerous to stay here longer If these intruders know of the secret others must also The Disks should be removed to a safe place Inform Lord Verminaard that I am leaving Xak Tsaroth I will join him in Pax Tharkas and I will bring the intruders with me for questioning Inform Lord Verminarrd the draconian asked shocked Very well Khisanth responded sarcastically If you insist on the charade ask my Lords permission I suppose you have sent most of the troops up to the top Yes royal one The draconian bowed Khisanth considered the matter Perhaps you are not such an idiot after all she mused I can handle things below Concentrate your search in the upper parts of the city When you find these intruders bring them straight to me Do not hurt them any more than necessary to subdue them And be careful of that staff The draconian fell to its knees before the dragon who sniffed in derision and crept back into the dark shadows out of which she had come The draconian ran down the stairs where it was joined by several more creatures who appeared out of the mist After a brief muffled exchange in their own language the draconians started up the north street They walked nonchalantly laughing at some private joke and soon vanished into the mist Theyre not worried are they Sturm said No Tanis agreed grimly They think theyve got us Lets face it Tanis Theyre right Sturm said This plan weve been discussing has one major flaw If we sneak in without the dragon knowing and if we get the Diskswe still have to get out of this godforsaken city with draconians crawling all over the upper levels I asked you before and Ill ask you now Tanis said Have you got a better plan Ive got a better plan Caramon said gruffly No disrespect Tanis but we all know how elves feel about fighting The big man gestured toward the palace Thats obviously where the dragon lives Lets lure it out as we planned only this time well fight it not creep around its lair like thieves When the dragons disposed of then we can get the Disks My dear brother Raistlin whispered your strength lies in your swordarm not in your mind Tanis is wise as the knight said when we started on this little adventure You would do well to pay attention to him What do you know of dragons my brother You have seen the effects of its deadly breath Raistlin was overcome by a fit of coughing He dragged a soft cloth out from the sleeve of his robe Tanis saw that the cloth was stained with blood After a moment Raistlin continued You could defend yourself against that perhaps and against the sharp claws and fangs and the slashing tail which can knock down those pillars But what will you use dear brother against her magic Dragons are the most ancient of magicusers She could charm you as I have charmed my little friend She could put you to sleep with a word then murder you while you dreamed All right Caramon muttered chagrined I didnt know any of that Damn it who does know anything about these creatures There is much lore on the dragons in Solamnia Sturm said softly He wants to fight the dragon too Tanis realized He is thinking of Huma the perfect knight called Dragonbane Bupu tugged on Raistlins robe Come You go No more bosses No more dragon She and the other gully dwarves started splashing across the flagstone plaza Well Tanis said looking at the two warriors It seems we have no choice Sturm said stiffly We do not face the enemy we hide behind gully dwarves Sooner or later a time must come when we face these monsters He spun on his heel and walked off his back straight his moustaches bristling The companions followed Maybe were worrying needlessly Tanis scratched his beard glancing back at the palace that was now obscured by the mist Perhaps this is the only dragon left in Krynnone that survived the Age of Dreams Raistlins lips twisted Remember the stars Tanis he murmured The Queen of Darkness has returned Recall the words of the Canticle swarm of her shrieking hosts Her hosts were dragons according to the ancient ones She has returned and her hosts have come with her This way Bupu clutched at Raistlin pointing down a street branching off to the north This home At least its dry Flint grumbled Turning right they left the river behind them Mist closed in around the companions as they entered another nest of ruined buildings This section of town must have been the poorer part of the city of Xak Tsaroth even in its glory daysthe buildings were in the last stages of decay and collapse The gully dwarves began whooping and hollering as they ran down the street Sturm looked at Tanis in alarm at the noise Cant you get them to be quieter Tanis asked Bupu So the draconianserbosses wont find us Pooh She shrugged No bosses They not come here Afraid of the great Highbulp Tanis had his doubts about that but glancing around he couldnt see any signs of the draconians From what he had observed the lizardlike men seemed to lead a wellordered militaristic life By contrast the streets in this part of town were cluttered with trash and filth The disreputable buildings erupted with gully dwarves Males females and dirty ragged children stared at them curiously as they walked down the street Bupu and the other spellbound gully dwarves swarmed around Raistlin practically carrying him The draconians were undeniably smart Tanis thought They allowed their slaves to live their private lives in peaceso long as they didnt stir up trouble A good idea considering that gully dwarves out numbered draconians about ten to one Though they were basically cowards gully dwarves had a reputation as very nasty fighters when backed into a corner Bupu brought the group to a halt in front of one of the darkest dingiest filthiest alleys Tanis had ever seen A foul mist flowed out it The buildings leaned over holding each other up like drunks stumbling out of a tavern As he watched small dark creatures skittered out of the alley and gully dwarf children began chasing after them Dinner shrieked one smacking his lips Those are rats Goldmoon cried in horror Do we have to go in there Sturm growled staring at the tottering buildings The smell alone is enough to knock a troll dead Caramon added And Id rather die under the dragons claw than have a gully dwarf hovel fall on top of me Bupu gestured down the alley The Highbulp she said pointing to the most dilapidated building on the block Stay here and keep watch if you want Tanis told Sturm Ill go talk with the Highbulp No The knight scowled gesturing the halfelf into the alley Were in this together The alley ran several hundred feet to the east then it twisted north and came suddenly to a dead end Ahead of them was a decaying brick wall and no way out Their return was blocked by gully dwarves who had run in after them Ambush Sturm hissed and drew his sword Caramon began to rumble deep in his throat The gully dwarves seeing the Hash of cold steel panicked Falling all over themselves and each other they whirled and fled back down the alley Bupu glared at Sturm and Caramon in disgust She turned to Raistlin You make them stop she demanded pointing to the warriors Or I not take to Highbulp Put your sword away knight Raistlin hissed unless you think youve found a foe worthy of your attention Sturm glowered at Raistlin and for a moment Tanis thought he might attack the mage but then the knight thrust his sword away I wish I knew what your game was magician Sturm said coldly You were so eager to come to this city even before we knew about the Disks Why What are you after Raistlin did not reply He stared at the knight malevolently with his strange golden eyes then turned to Bupu They will not trouble you further little one he whispered Bupu looked around to make certain they were properly cowed then she walked forward and knocked twice on the wall with her grubby fist Secret door she said importantly Two knocks answered Bupus knock That signal she said Three knocks Now they let in But she only knocked twice Tas began giggling Bupu glared at him Shhh Tanis nudged the kender Nothing happened Bupu frowning knocked twice more Two knocks answered She waited Caramon his eyes on the alley opening began moving restlessly from one foot to the other Bupu knocked twice again Two knocks answered Finally Bupu yelled at the wall I knock secret code knock You let in Secret knock five knocks answered a muffled voice I knock five knocks Bupu stated angrily You let in You knock six knocks I count eight knocks argued another voice Bupu suddenly pushed on the wall with both hands It opened easily She peered inside I knock four knocks You let in she said raising a clenched fist All right the voice grumbled Bupu shut the door knocked twice Tanis hoping to avoid any more incidents and delays glared at the kender who was writhing with suppressed laughter The door swung openagain You come in the guard said sourly But that not four knocks he whispered to Bupu loudly She ignored him as she swept disdainfully past him dragging her bag along the floor We see Highbulp she announced You take this lot to Highbulp One of the guards gasped staring at the giant Caramon and the tall Riverwind with wide eyes His companion began backing up See Highbulp Bupu said proudly The gully dwarf guard never taking his eyes off the formidablelooking group backed into a stinking filthy hallway then broke into a run He began shouting at the top of his lungs An army An army has broken in They could hear his shouts echo down the hallway Bah Bupu sniffed Glupphunger spawn Come See Highbulp She started down the hallway clutching her bag to her chest The companions could still hear the shouts of the gully dwarf echoing down the corridor An army An army of giants Save the Highbulp The great Highbulp Phudge I was a gully dwarf among gully dwarves He was almost intelligent rumored to be fabulously wealthy and a notorious coward The Bulps had long been the elite clan of Xak Tsarothor Th as they called itever since Nulph Bulp fell down a shaft one night in a drunken stupor and discovered the city Upon sobering up the next morning he claimed it for his clan The Bulps promptly moved in and in later years graciously allowed the clans Slud and Giup to occupy the city as well Life was good in the ruined cityby gully dwarf standards anyway The outside world left them alone since the outside world hadnt the foggiest notion they were there and wouldnt have cared if it did The Bulps had no trouble maintaining their dominance over the other clans mostly because it was a Bulp Glunggu with a scientific turn of mind certain jealous members of the Slud clan whispered that his mother had been a gnome who developed the lift putting to use the two enormous iron pots used by the citys former residents for rendering lard The lift enabled the gully dwarves to extend their scavenging activities to the jungle above the sunken citygreatly improving their standard of living Glunggu Bulp became a hero and was proclaimed Highbulp by unanimous decision The chieftainship of the clans had remained in the Bulp family ever since The years passed and then suddenly the outside world took an interest in Xak Tsaroth The arrival of the dragon and the draconians put a sad crimp on the gully dwarf lifestyle The draconians had initially intended to wipe out the filthy little nuisances but the gully dwarvesled by the great Phudgehad cringed and cowered and whimpered and wailed and prostrated themselves so abjectly that the draconians were merciful and simply enslaved them So it was that the gully dwarvesfor the first time in several hundred years of living in Xak Tsarothwere forced to work The draconians repaired buildings put things into military order and generally made life miserable for the gully dwarves who had to cook and clean and repair things Needless to say the great Phudge was not pleased with this state of affairs He spent long hours thinking up ways to remove the dragon He knew the location of the dragons lair of course and had even discovered a secret route leading there He had actually sneaked in once when the dragon was away Phudge had been awestruck by the vast amount of pretty rocks and shining coins gathered in the huge underground room The great Highbulp had traveled some in his wild youth and he knew that folk in the outside world coveted these pretty rocks and would give vast amounts of colorful and gaudy cloth Phudge had a weakness for fine clothes in return On the spot the Highbulp drew up a map so he wouldnt forget how to get back to the treasure He even had the presence of mind to swipe a few of the smaller rocks Phudge dreamed of this wealth for months afterwards but he never found another opportunity to return This was due to two factors one the dragon never left again and two Phudge couldnt make heads nor tails of his map If only the dragon would leave permanently he thought or if some hero would come along and conveniently stick a sword into it These were the Highbulps fondest dreams and this was the state of affairs when the great Phudge heard his guards proclaiming that an army was attacking Thus it came to pass thatwhen Bupu finally dragged the great Phudge out from under his bed and convinced him that he was not about to be set upon by an army of giantsHighbulp Phudge I began to believe that dreams could come true And so youre here to kill the dragon said the great Highbulp Phudge I to Tanis HalfElven No Tanis said patiently were not The companions stood in the Court of the Aghar before the throne of a gully dwarf Bupu had introduced as the great Highbulp Bupu kept an eye on the companions as they entered the throne room eagerly anticipating their looks of stunned awe Bupu was not disappointed The looks on the companions faces as they entered might well be described as stunned The city of Xak Tsaroth had been stripped of its finery by the early Bulps who used it to decorate the throne room of their lord Following the philosophy that if one yard of gold cloth is good forty yards is better and totally uninhibited by good taste the gully dwarves turned the throne room of the great Highbulp into a masterpiece of confusion Heavy frayed gold cloth swirled and draped every available inch of wall space Huge tapestries hung from the ceiling some of them upsidedown The tapestries must have once been beautiful delicatecolored threads blending to show scenes of city life or portray stories and legends from the past But the gully dwarves wanting to liven them up painted over the cloth in garish clashing colors Thus Sturm was shocked to the core of his being when confronted by a bright red Huma battling a purplespotted dragon beneath an emerald green sky Graceful nude statues standing in all the wrong places adorned the room as well These too the gully dwarves had enhanced considering pure white marble drab and depressing They painted the statues with enough realism and attention to detail that Caramonwith an embarrassed glance at Goldmoonflushed bright red and kept his eyes on the foor The companions in fact had problems maintaining their serious mien when ushered into this gallery of artistic horrors One failed utterly Tasslehoff was immediately overcome by the giggles so severely that Tanis was forced to send the kender back to the Waiting Place outside the Court to try and compose himself The rest of the group bowed solemnly to the great Phudgewith the exception of Flint who stood bolt upright his hands fingering his battleaxe without the trace of a smile on his aged face The dwarf had laid his hand on Taniss arm before they entered the court of the Highbulp Dont be taken in by this foolery Tanis Flint warned These creatures can be treacherous The Highbulp was somewhat flustered when the companions entered especially at the sight of the tall fighters But Raistlin made a few wellchosen remarks that considerably mollified and reassured if disappointed the Highbulp The mage interrupted by fits of coughing explained that they did not want to cause trouble they simply planned to retrieve an object of religious value from the dragons lair and leave preferably without disturbing the dragon This of course didnt fit in with Phudges plans He therefore assumed he hadnt heard correctly Cocooned in gaudy robes he leaned back in the chipped goldleaf throne and repeated calmly You here Got swords Kill dragon No said Tanis again As our friend Raistlin explained the dragon is guarding an object that belongs to our gods We want to remove the object and escape the city before the dragon is aware that it is gone The Highbulp frowned How me know you not take all treasure leave Highbulp only one mad dragon There be lot of treasurepretty rocks Raistlin looked up sharply his eyes gleaming Sturm fidgeting with his sword glanced at the mage in disgust We will bring you the pretty rocks Tanis assured the Highbulp Help us and you will get all the treasure We want only to find this relic of our gods It had become obvious to the Highbulp that he was dealing with thieves and liars not the heroes he had expected This group was apparently as frightened of the dragon as he was and that gave the Highbulp an idea What you want from Highbulp he asked trying to subdue his glee and appear subtle Tanis sighed in relief At last they seemed to be getting somewhere Bupuhe indicated the female gully dwarf clinging to Raistlins sleevetold us that you were the only one in the city who could lead us to the dragons lair Lead The great Phudge lost his composure for a moment and clutched his robes around him No lead Great Highbulp not expendable People need me No no I didnt mean lead Tanis amended hastily If you had a map or could send someone to show us the way Map Phudge mopped the sweat off his brow with the sleeve of his robe Should say so in first place Map Yes I send for map Meantime you eat Guests of the Highbulp Guards take to mess hall No thank you Tanis said politely unable to look at the others They had passed the gully dwarf mess hall on their way to see the Highbulp The smell alone had been enough to ruin even Caramons appetite We have our own food Tanis continued We would like some time to ourselves to rest and discuss our plans further Certainly The Highbulp scooted forward to the front of the throne Two of his guards came over to help him down since his feet didnt touch the floor Go back to Waiting Place Sit Eat Talk I send map Maybe you tell Phudge plans Tanis glanced swiftly at the gully dwarf and saw the Highbulps squinty eyes gleam with cunning The halfelf felt cold suddenly realizing this gully dwarf was no buffoon Tanis began to wish he had talked more with Flint Our plans are hardly formed yet your majesty the halfelf said The great Highbulp knew better Long ago he had drilled a hole through the wall of the room known as Waiting Place so that he could eavesdrop on his subjects as they waited for an audience with him discovering what they intended to bother him about in advance Thus he knew a great deal about the companions plans already so he let the matter drop The use of the term your majesty may have had something to do with this the Highbulp had never heard anything quite so suitable Your majesty Phudge repeated sighing with pleasure He poked one of his guards in the back You remember From now on say Your Majesty Yyes yyour uh majesty the gully dwarf stuttered The great Phudge waved his filthy hand graciously and the companions bowed their way out Highbulp Phudge I stood for a moment beside his throne smiling in what he considered a charming manner until his guests were gone Then his expression changed transforming into a smile so shrewd and devious his guards crowded around him in eager anticipation You he said to one Go to quarters Bring map Give to fools in next room The guard saluted and ran off The other guard remained close waiting in openmouthed expectation Phudge glanced around then drew the guard even nearer considering exactly how to phrase his next command He needed some heroes and if he had to create his own out of whatever scum came along then he would do so If they died it was no great loss If they succeeded in killing the dragon so much the better The gully dwarves would get what wasto themmore precious than all the pretty rocks in Krynn a return to the sweet halcyon days of freedom And so enough of this nonsense about sneaking around Phudge leaned over and whispered in the guards ear You go to dragon Give her best regards of his majesty Highbulp Phudge I and tell her The Highbulps map The spellbook of Fistandantilus I dont trust that little bastard any farther than I can stand the smell of him Caramon growled I agree Tanis said quietly But what choice do we have Weve agreed to bring him the treasure He has everything to lose and nothing to gain if he betrays us They sat on the floor in the Waiting Place a filthy antechamber outside the throne room The decorations in this room were just as vulgar as in the Court The companions were nervous and tense speaking little and forcing themselves to eat Raistlin refused food Curled up on the floor apart from the others he prepared and drank down the strange herbal mixture that eased his cough Then he wrapped himself in his robes and stretched out eyes closed on the floor Bupu sat curled up near him munching on something from her bag Caramon going over to check on his brother was horrified to see a tail disappear into her mouth with a slurp Riverwind sat by himself He did not take part in the hushed conversation as the friends went over their plans once again The Plainsman stared moodily at the floor When he felt a light touch on his arm he didnt even lift his head Goldmoon her face pale knelt beside him She tried to speak failed the cleared her throat We must talk she said firmly in their language Is that a command he asked bitterly She swallowed Yes she answered barely audible Riverwind rose to his feet and walked over to stand in front of a garish tapestry He did not look at Goldmoon or even speak to her His face was drawn into a stern mask but underneath Goldmoon could see the searing pain in his soul She gently laid her hand on his arm Forgive me she said softly Riverwind regarded her in astonishment She stood before him her head bowed an almost childlike shame on her face He reached out to stroke the silvergold hair of the one he loved more than life itself He felt Goldmoon tremble at his touch and his heart ached with love Moving his hand from her head to her neck he very gently and tenderly drew the beloved head to his chest and then suddenly clasped her in his arms Ive never heard you say those words before he said smiling to himself knowing she could not see him I have never said them she gulped her cheek pressed against his leather shirt Oh my beloved I am sorrier than I can say that you came home to Chieftains Daughter and not Goldmoon But Ive been so afraid No he whispered I am the one who should ask forgiveness He raised his hand to wipe away her tears I didnt realize what you had gone through All I could think of was myself and the dangers I had faced I wish you had told me hearts dearest I wished you had asked she replied looking up at him earnestly I have been Chieftains Daughter so long it is the only thing I know how to be It is my strength It gives me courage when I am frightened I dont think I can let go I dont want you to let go He smiled at her smoothing wayward strands of hair from her face I fell in love with Chieftains Daughter the first time I saw you Do you remember At the games held in your honor You refused to bow to receive my blessing she said You acknowledged my fathers leadership but denied that I was a goddess You said man could not make gods of other men Her eyes looked back so many many years How tall and proud and handsome you were talking of ancient gods that did not exist to me then And how furious you were he recalled and how beautiful Your beauty was a blessing to me in itself I needed no other You wanted me thrown out of the games Goldmoon smiled sadly You thought I was angry because you had shamed me before the people but that was not so No What was it then Chieftains Daughter Her face flushed a dusky rose but she lifted her clear blue eyes to him I was angry because I knew when I saw you standing there refusing to kneel before me that I had lost part of myself and that until you claimed it I would never be whole again For reply the Plainsman pressed her to him kissing her hair gently Riverwind she said swallowing Chieftains Daughter is still here I dont think she can ever leave But you must know that Goldmoon is underneath and if this journey ever ends and we come to peace at last then Goldmoon will be yours forever and we will banish Chieftains Daughter to the winds A thump at the Highbulps door caused everyone to start nervously as a gully dwarf guard stumbled into the room Map he said thrusting a crumpled piece of paper at Tanis Thank you said the halfelf gravely And extend our thanks to the Highbulp His Majesty the Highbulp the guard corrected with an anxious glance toward a tapestrycovered wall Bobbing clumsily he backed into the Highbulps quarters Tanis spread the map out Everyone gathered around it even Flint After one look however the dwarf snorted derisively and walked back to his couch Tanis laughed ruefully We might have expected it I wonder if the great Phudge remembers where the big secret room is Of course not Raistlin sat up opening his strange golden eyes and peering at them through halfclosed lids That is why he has never returned for the treasure However there is one among us who knows where the dragons lair is located Everyone followed the mages gaze Bupu glared back at them defiantly You right I know she said sulking I know secret place I go there find pretty rocks But dont tell Highbulp Will you tell us Tanis asked Bupu looked at Raistlin He nodded I tell she mumbled Give map Raistlin seeing the others engrossed in looking at the map beckoned to his brother Is the plan still the same the mage whispered Yes Caramon frowned And I dont like it I should go with you Nonsense Raistlin hissed You would only be in my way Then he added more gently I will be in no danger I assure you He laid his hand on his twins arm and drew him close Besidesthe mage glanced aroundthere is something you must do for me my brother Something you must bring me from the dragons lair Raistlins touch was unusually hot his eyes burned Caramon uneasily started to pull back seeing something in his brother he hadnt seen since the Towers of High Sorcery but Raistlins hand clutched at him What is it Caramon asked reluctantly A spellbook Raistlin whispered So this is why you wanted to come to Xak Tsaroth said Caramon You knew this spellbook would be here I read about it years ago I knew it had been in Xak Tsaroth prior to the Cataclysm all of the Order knew it but we assumed it had been destroyed with the city When I found out Xak Tsaroth had escaped destruction I realized there might be a chance the book had survived How do you know its in the dragons lair I dont I am merely surmising To magicusers this book is Xak Tsaroths greatest treasure You may be certain that if the dragon found it she is using it And you want me to get it for you Caramon said slowly What does it look like Like my spellbook of course except the bonewhite parchment is bound in nightblue leather with runes of silver stamped on the front It will feel deathly cold to the touch What do the runes say You do not want to know Raistlin whispered Whose book was it Caramon asked suspiciously Raistlin fell silent his golden eyes abstracted as if he were searching inwardly trying to remember something forgotten You have never heard of him my brother he said finally in a whisper that forced Caramon to lean closer Yet he was one of the greatest of my order His name was Fistandantilus The way you describe the spellbook Caramon hesitated fearing what Raistlin would reply He swallowed and started over This Fistandantilusdid he wear the Black Robes He could not meet his brothers piercing gaze Ask me no more Raistlin hissed You are as bad as the others How can any of you understand me Seeing his twins look of pain the mage sighed Trust me Caramon It is not a particularly powerful spellbookone of the mages early books in fact One he had when he was very young very young indeed Raistlin murmured staring far off Then he blinked and said more briskly But it will be valuable to me nonetheless You must get it You must He started to cough Sure Raist Caramon promised soothing his brother Dont get worked up Ill find it Good Caramon Excellent Caramon Raistlin whispered when he could speak He sank back into the corner and closed his eyes Now let me rest I must be ready Caramon stood up looked at his brother a moment then he turned around and nearly fell over Bupu who was standing behind him gazing up at him suspiciously with wide eyes What was all that about Sturm asked gruffly as Caramon returned to the group Oh nothing the big man mumbled flushing guiltily Stunn cast an alarmed glance at Tanis What is it Caramon Tanis asked putting the rolled map in his belt and facing the warrior Anything wrong Nno Caramon stuttered Its nothing Iuhtried to get Raistlin to let me go with him He said Id just be in the way Tanis studied Caramon He knew the big man was telling the truth but Tanis also knew the warrior wasnt telling all the truth Caramon would cheerfully shed the last drop of his blood for any member of the company but Tanis suspected he would betray them all at Raistlins command The giant looked at Tanis silently begging him to ask no more questions Hes right you know Caramon Tanis said finally clapping the big man on the arm Raistlin wont be in danger Bupu will be with him Shell bring him back here to hide Hes just got to conjure up some of his fancy pyrotechnics create a diversion to draw the dragon away from her lair Hell be long gone by the time she gets there Sure I know that said Caramon forcing a chuckle You need me anyway We do Tanis said seriously Now is everyone ready Silently grimly they stood up Raistlin rose and came forward hood over his face hands folded in his robes There was an aura around the mage indefinable yet frighteningthe aura of power derived and created from within Tanis cleared his throat Well give you a five hundred count Tanis said to Raistlin Then well start The secret place marked on the map is a trap door located in a building not far from here according to your little friend It leads beneath the city to a tunnel that comes up under the dragons lair near where we saw her today Create your diversion in the plaza then come back here Well meet here give the Highbulp his treasure and lie low until night When its dark well escape I understand Raistlin said calmly I wish I did Tanis thought bitterly I wish I understood what was going on in that mind of yours mage But the halfelf said nothing We go now asked Bupu looking at Tanis anxiously We go now Tanis said Raistlin crept from the shadowy alley and moved swiftly down the street to the south He saw no signs of life It was as if all the gully dwarves had been swallowed up by the mist He found this thought disturbing and kept to the shadows The frail mage could move silently if there was need He only hoped he could control his coughing The pain and congestion in his chest had eased when he drank the herbal mixture whose recipe had been given him by ParSaliana kind of apology from the great sorcerer for the trauma the young mage had endured But the mixtures effect would soon wear off Bupu peered out from behind his robes her beady black eyes squinting down the street leading east to the Great Plaza No one she said and tugged on the mages robe We go now No onethought Raistlin worried It didnt make sense Where were the crowds of gully dwarves He had the feeling something had gone wrong but there wasnt time to turn backTanis and the others were on their way to the secret tunnel entrance The mage smiled bitterly What a fools quest this was turning out to be They would probably all die in this wretched city Bupu tugged on his robe again Shrugging he cast his hood up over his head and together he and the gully dwarf flitted down the mistshrouded street Two armorclad figures detached themselves from a dark doorway and slunk quickly after Raistlin and Bupu This is the place Tanis said softly Opening a rotting door he peered in Its dark in here Well need a light There was a sound of flint striking metal and then a flare of light as Caramon lit one of the torches they had borrowed from the Highbulp The warrior handed one to Tanis and lit one for himself and Riverwind Tanis stepped inside the building and immediately found himself up to his ankles in water Holding the torch aloft he saw water pouring in steady streams down the walls of the dismal room It swirled around the center of the floor then ran out through cracks around the edges Tanis sloshed to the center and held his torch close to the water There it is I can see it he said as the others waded into the room He pointed to a trap door in the floor An iron pullring was barely visible in its center Caramon Tanis stood back Bah Flint snorted If a gully dwarf can open this I can open it Stand aside The dwarf elbowed everyone back plunged his hand into the water and heaved There was a moments silence Flint grunted his face turned red He stopped straightened up with a gasp then reached down and tried again There wasnt a creak The door remained shut Tanis put his hand on the dwarfs shoulder Flint Bupu says she only goes down during the dry season Youre trying to lift half of Newsea along with the door Wellthe dwarf puffed for breathwhy didnt you say so Let the big ox try his luck Caramon stepped forward He reached down into the water and gave a heave His shoulder muscles bulged and veins in his neck stood out There was a sucking sound then the suction was released so suddenly that the big warrior nearly fell over backwards Water drained from the room as Caramon eased the wooden plank door over Tanis held his torch down to see A fourfootsquare shaft gaped in the floor a narrow iron ladder descended into the shaft Whats the count Tanis asked his throat dry Four hundred and three answered Slurms deep voice Four hundred and four The companions stood around the trap door shivering in the chill air hearing nothing but the sound of water pouring down the shaft Four hundred and fiftyone noted the knight calmly Tanis scratched his beard Caramon coughed twice as though reminding them of his absent brother Flint fidgeted and dropped his axe in the water Tas absentmindedly chewed on the end of his topknot Goldmoon pale but composed drew near Riverwind the nondescript brown staff in her hand He put his arm around her Nothing was worse than waiting Five hundred said Sturm finally About time Tasslehoff swung himself down onto the ladder Tanis went next holding his torch to light the way for Goldmoon who came after him The others followed climbing slowly down into an access shaft of the city sewage system The shaft ran about twenty feet straight down then opened up into a fivefootwide tunnel that ran north and south Check the depth of the water Tanis warned the kender as Tas was about to let go of the ladder The kender hanging onto the last rung with one hand lowered his hoopak staff into the dark swirling water below him The staff sank about halfway Two feet said Tas cheerfully He dropped in with a splash the water hitting him around the thighs He looked up at Tanis inquiringly That way Tanis pointed South Holding his staff in the air Tasslehoff let the current sweep him along Wheres that diversion Sturm asked his voice echoing Tanis had been wondering that himself We probably wont be able to hear anything down here He hoped that was true Raistll come through Dont worry Caramon said grimly Tanis Tasslehoff fell back into the halfelf Theres something down here I felt it go by my feet Just keep moving Tanis muttered and hope it isnt hungry They waded on in silence the torchlight flickering off the walls creating illusions in the minds eye More than once Tanis saw something reach out for him only to realize it was the shadow cast by Caramons helm or Tass hoopak The tunnel ran straight south for about two hundred feet then turned east The companions stopped Down the eastern arm of the sewer glimmered a column of dim light filtering down from above Thisaccording to Bupumarked the dragons lair Douse the torches Tanis hissed plunging his torch in the water Touching the slimy wall Tanis followed the kender Tass red outline showing up vividly to his elven eyesthrough the tunnel Behind him he heard Flint complaining about the effects of water on his rheumatism Shhhh Tanis whispered as they drew near the light Trying to be silent in spite of clanking armor they soon stood by a slender ladder that ran up to an iron grating No one ever bothers to lock floor gratings Tas pulled Tanis close to whisper in his ear But Im sure I can open it if it is Tanis nodded He didnt add that Bupu had been able to open it as well The art of picking locks was as much a matter of pride to the kender as Slums moustaches were to the knight They all stood watching kneedeep in water as Tas skimmed up the ladder I still dont hear anything outside Sturm muttered Shhhh Caramon growled harshly The grating had a lock a simple one that Tas opened in moments Then he silently lifted the grating and peered out Sudden darkness descended on him darkness so thick and impenetrable it seemed to hit him like a lead weight nearly making him lose his hold on the grating Hurriedly he put the grating back into place without making a sound then slid down the ladder bumping into Tanis Tas the halfelf grabbed him Is that you I cant see Whats going on I dont know It just got dark all of a sudden What do you mean you cant see Sturm whispered to Tanis What about your elftalent Gone Tanis said grimly just as in Darken Woodand out by the well No one spoke as they stood huddled in the tunnel All they could hear was the sound of their own breathing and water dripping from the walls The dragon was up therewaiting for them The sacrifice The twicedead city Despair blacker than the darkness blinded Tanis It was my plan the only way we had a chance to get out of here alive he thought It was soundit should have worked What went wrong Raistlincould he have betrayed us No Tanis clenched his fist No damn it The mage was distant unlikable impossible to understand yes but he was loyal to them Tanis would swear it Where was Raistlin Dead perhaps Not that it mattered They would all be dead Tanisthe halfelf felt a firm grasp on his arm and recognized Sturms deep voiceI know what youre thinking We have no choice Were running out of time This is our only chance to get the Disks We wont get another Im going to look Tanis said He climbed past the kender and peered through the grate It was dark magically dark Tanis put his head in his hand and tried to think Sturm was right time was running out Yet how could he trust the knights judgement Sturm wanted to fight the dragon Tanis crawled back down the ladder Were going he said Suddenly all he wanted to do was get this over with then they could go home Home to Solace No Tas He grabbed hold of the kender and dragged him back down the ladder The fighters go first Sturm and Caramon Then the rest But the knight was already shoving past him eagerly his sword clanking against his thigh Were always last Tasslehoff sniffed shoving the dwarf along Flint climbed the ladder slowly his knees creaking Hurry up Tas said I hope nothing happens before we get there Ive never talked to a dragon Ill bet the dragons never talked to a kender either The dwarf snorted You realize you harebrain that were probably going to die Tanis knows I could tell by his voice Tas paused clinging to the ladder while Sturm slowly pushed on the grating You know Flint the kender said seriously my people dont fear death In a way we look forward to itthe last big adventure But I think Id feel badly about leaving this life Id miss my thingshe patted his pouchesand my maps and you and Tanis Unless he added brightly we all go to the same place when we die Flint had a sudden vision of the happygolucky kender lying cold and dead He felt a lump of pain in his chest and was thankful for the concealing darkness Clearing his throat he said huskily If you think Im going to share my afterlife with a bunch of kender youre crazier than Raistlin Come on Sturm carefully lifted the grating and shoved it to one side It scraped over the floor causing him to grit his teeth He heaved himself up easily Turning he bent down to help Caramon who was having trouble squeezing his body and his clanking arsenal through the shaft In the name of Istar be quiet Sturm hissed Im trying Caramon muttered finally climbing over the edge Sturm gave his hand to Goldmoon Last came Tas delighted that nobody had done anything exciting in his absence Weve got to have light Sturm said Light replied a voice as cold and dark as winter midnight Yes let us have light The darkness fled instantly The companions saw they were in a huge domed chamber that soared hundreds of feet into the air Cold gray light filtered into the room through a crack in the ceiling shining on a large altar in the center of the circular room On the floor surrounding the altar were masses of jewels coins and other treasures of the dead city The jewels did not gleam The gold did not glitter The dim light illuminated nothingnothing except a black dragon perched on top of the pedestal like some huge beast of prey Feeling betrayed the dragon asked in conversational tones The mage betrayed us Where is he Serving you Sturm cried fiercely drawing his sword and taking a step forward Stand back foul Knight of Solamnia Stand back or your magicuser will use his magic no more The dragon snaked her great neck down and stared at them with gleaming red eyes Then slowly and delicately she lifted one clawed foot Lying beneath it on the pedestal was Raistlin Raist Caramon roared and lunged for the altar Stop fool the dragon hissed She rested one pointed claw lightly on the mages abdomen With a great effort Raistlin moved his head to look at his brother with his strange golden eyes He made a weak gesture and Caramon halted Tanis saw something move on the floor beneath the altar It was Bupu huddled among the riches too afraid even to whimper The Staff of Magius lay next to her Move one step closer and I will impale this shriveled human upon the altar with my claw Caramons face flushed a deep ugly red Let him go he shouted Your fight is with me My fight is with none of you the dragon said lazily moving its wings Raistlin flinched as the dragons clawed foot shifted slightly teasingly digging her claw into his flesh The mages metallic skin glistened with sweat He drew a deep ragged breath Dont even twitch mage the dragon sneered We speak the same language remember One word of a spell and your friends carcasses will be used to feed the gully dwarves Raistlins eyes closed as in exhaustion But Tanis could see the mages hands clench and unclench and he knew Raistlin was preparing one final spell It would be his lastby the time he cast it the dragon would kill him But it might give Riverwind a chance to reach the Disks and get out alive with Goldmoon Tanis edged toward the Plainsmen As I was saying the dragon continued smoothly I do not choose to fight any of you How you have escaped my wrath so far I do not understand Still you are here And you return to me that which was stolen Yes lady of Queshu I see you hold the blue crystal staff Bring it to me Tanis hissed one word to Goldmoon Stall But looking at her cool marble face he wondered if she heard him or if she even heard the dragon She seemed to be listening to other words other voices Obey me The dragon lowered her head menacingly Obey me or the mage dies And after himthe knight And then the halfelf And so onone after the other until you lady of Queshu are the last survivor Then you will bring me the staff and you will beg me to be merciful Goldmoon bowed her head in submission Gently pushing Riverwind away with her hand she turned to Tanis and clasped the halfelf in a loving embrace Farewell my friend she said loudly laying her cheek against his Her voice dropped to a whisper I know what I must do I am going to take the staff to the dragon and No Tanis said fiercely It wont matter The dragon intends to kill us anyway Listen to me Goldmoons nails dug into Taniss arm Stay with Riverwind Tanis Do not let him try to stop me And if I tried to stop you Tanis asked gently holding Goldmoon close in his arms You wont she said with a sweet sad smile You know that each of us has a destiny to fulfillas the Forestmaster said Riverwind will need you Farewell my friend Goldmoon stepped back her clear blue eyes on Riverwind as though she would memorize every detail to keep with her throughout eternity Realizing she was saying goodbye he started to go to her Riverwind Tanis said softly Trust her She trusted you all those years She waited while you fought the battles Now it is you who must wait This is her battle Riverwind trembled then stood still Tanis could see the veins swell in his neck his jaw muscles clench The halfelf gripped the Plainsmans arm The tall man didnt even look at him His eyes were on Goldmoon What is this delay the dragon asked I grow bored Come forward Goldmoon turned away from Riverwind She walked past Flint and Tasslehoff The dwarf bowed his head Tas watched wideeyed and solemn Somehow this wasnt as exciting as he had imagined For the first time in his life the kender felt small and helpless and alone It was a horrible unpleasant feeling and he thought death might be preferable Goldmoon stopped near Caramon put her hand on his arm Dont worry she said to the big warrior who was staring at his brother in agony hell be all right Caramon choked and nodded And then Goldmoon neared Sturm Suddenly as if the horror of the dragon was too overwhelming she slumped forward The knight caught her and held her Come with me Sturm Goldmoon whispered as he put his arm around her You must vow to do as I command no matter what happens Vow on your honor as a Knight of Solamnia Sturm hesitated Goldmoons eyes calm and clear met his Vow she demanded or I go alone I vow lady he said reverently I will obey Goldmoon sighed thankfully Walk with me Make no threatening gesture Together the barbarian woman of the Plains and the knight walked toward the dragon Raistlin lay beneath the dragons claw his eyes closed preparing himself mentally for the spell that would be his last But the words to the spell would not form out of the turmoil in his mind He fought to regain control I am wasting myselfand for what Raistlin wondered bitterly To get these fools out of the mess they got themselves into They will not attack for fear of hurting meeven though they fear and despise me It makes no sensejust as my sacrifice makes no sense Why am I dying for them when I deserve to live more than they It is not for them you do this a voice answered him Raistlin started trying to concentrate to catch hold of the voice It was a real voice a familiar voice but he couldnt remember whose it was or where he had heard it All he knew was that it spoke to him in moments of great stress The closer to death he came the louder was the voice It is not for them that you make this sacrifice the voice repeated It is because you cannot bear defeat Nothing has ever defeated you not even death itself Raistlin drew a deep breath and relaxed He did not understand the words completely just as he could not remember the voice But now the spell came easily to his mind Astol arakhkh urn he murmured feeling the magic begin to course through his frail body Then another voice broke his concentration and this voice was a living voice speaking to his mind He opened his eyes turned his head slowly and stared into the chamber at his companions The voice came from the womanbarbarian princess of a dead tribe Raistlin looked at Goldmoon as she walked toward him leaning on Sturms arm The words in her mind had touched Raistlins mind He regarded the woman coldly detachedly His distorted vision had forever killed any physical desire the mage might have felt when he looked upon human flesh He could not see the beauty that so captivated Tanis and his brother His hourglass eyes saw her withering and dying he felt no closeness no compassion for her He knew she pitied himand he hated her for thatbut she feared him as well So why then was she speaking to him She was telling him to wait Raistlin understood She knew what he intended and she was telling him it wasnt necessary She had been chosen She was the one who was going to make the sacrifice He watched Goldmoon with his strange golden eyes as she drew nearer and nearer her own eyes on the dragon He saw Sturm moving solemnly beside her looking as ancient and noble as old Huma himself What a perfect cats paw Sturm made the ideal participant in Goldmoons sacrifice But why had Riverwind allowed her to go Couldnt he see this coming Raistlin glanced quickly at Riverwind Ah of course The halfelf stood by his side looking pained and grieved dropping words of wisdom like blood no doubt The barbarian was becoming as gullible as Caramon Raistlin flicked his eyes back to Goldmoon She stood before the dragon now her face pale with resolve Next to her Sturm appeared grave and tortured gnawed by inner conflict Goldmoon had probably extracted some vow of strict obedience which the knight was honorbound to fulfill Raistlins lip curled in a sneer The dragon spoke and the mage tensed ready for action Lay the staff down with the other remnants of mankinds folly the dragon commanded Goldmoon inclining her shining scaled head toward the pile of treasure below the altar Goldmoon overcome with dragonfear did not move She could do nothing but stare at the monstrous creature trembling Sturm next to her searched the treasure trove with his eyes looking for the Disks of Mishakal fighting to control his fear of the dragon Sturm had not known he could be this frightened of anything He repeated the code Honor is Life over and over and he knew it was pride alone that kept him from running away Goldmoon saw Sturms hand shake she saw the knights face glistening with sweat Dear goddess she cried in her soul grant me courage Then Sturm nudged her She had to say something she realized She had been silent too long What will you give us in return for the miraculous staff Goldmoon asked forcing herself to speak calmly though her throat was parched and her tongue felt swollen The dragon laughedshrill ugly laughter What will I give you The dragon snaked her head to stare at Goldmoon Nothing Nothing at all I do not deal with thieves Still The dragon reared its head back its red eyes closed to slits Playfully she dug her claw into Raistlins flesh the mage flinched but he bore the pain without a murmur The dragon removed the claw and held it just high enough so that they could all see the blood drip from it It is not inconceivable that Lord Verminaardthe Dragon Highmaster may view favorably the fact that you surrender the staff He may even be inclined to mercyhe is a cleric and they have strange values But know this Lady of Queshu Lord Verminaard does not need your friends Give up the staff now and they will be spared Force me to take itand they will die The mage first of Goldmoon her spirit seemingly broken slumped in defeat Sturm moved close to her appearing to console her I have found the Disks he whispered harshly He grasped her arm feeling her shivering with fear Are you resolved on this course of action my lady he asked softly Goldmoon bowed her head She was deathly pale but composed and calm Tendrils of her fine silvergolden hair had escaped from the binding and fell around her face hiding her expression from the dragon Though she appeared defeated she looked up at Sturm and smiled There was both peace and sorrow in her smile much like the smile on the marble goddess She did not speak but Sturm had his answer He bowed in submission May my courage be equal to yours lady he said I will not fail you Farewell knight Tell Riverwind Goldmoon faltered blinking her eyes as tears filled them Fearing her resolve might yet break she swallowed her words and turned to face the dragon as the voice of Mishakal filled her being answering her prayer Present the staff boldly Goldmoon imbued with an inner strength raised the blue crystal staff We do not choose to surrender Goldmoon shouted her voice echoing throughout the chamber Moving swiftly before the startled dragon could react Chieftains Daughter swung her staff one last time striking the clawed foot poised above Raistlin The staff made a low ringing sound as it struck the dragon then it shattered A burst of pure radiant blue light beamed from the broken staff The light grew brighter spreading out in concentric waves engulfing the dragon Khisanth screamed in rage The dragon was injured terribly mortally She lashed out with her tail flung her head about and fought to escape the burning blue flame She wanted nothing except to kill those that dared inflict such pain but the intense blue fire relentlessly consumed heras it consumed Goldmoon The Chieftains Daughter had not dropped the staff when it shattered She held on to the fragmented end watching as the light grew keeping it as close to the dragon as she could When the blue light touched her hands she felt intense burning pain Staggering she fell to her knees still clutching the staff She heard the dragon shrieking and roaring above her then she could hear nothing but the ringing of the staff The pain grew so horrible it was no longer a part of her and she was overcome with a great weariness I will sleep she thought I will sleep and when I waken I will be where I truly belong Sturm saw the blue light slowly destroy the dragon then it spread along the staff to Goldmoon He heard the ringing sound grow louder and louder until it drowned out even the screams of the dying dragon Sturm took a step toward Goldmoon thinking to wrench the splintered staff from her hand and drag her clear of the deadly blue flame but even as he approached he knew he could not save her Halfblinded by the light and deafened by the sound the knight realized that it would take all his strength and courage to fulfill his oathto retrieve the Disks He tore his gaze from Goldmoon whose face was twisted in agony and whose flesh was withering in the fire Gritting his teeth against the pain in his head he staggered toward the treasure pile where he had seen the Diskshundreds of thin sheets of platinum bound together by a single ring through the top Reaching down he lifted them amazed at their lightness Then his heart almost stopped beating when a bloody hand reached up from the pile of treasure and grasped his wrist Help me He could not hear the voice so much as sense the thought Grasping Raistlins hand he pulled the mage to his feet Blood was visible through the red of Raistlins robe but he did not appear to be seriously injuredat least he could stand But could he walk Sturm needed help He wondered where the others were he couldnt see them in the brilliance Suddenly Caramon loomed up by his side his armor gleaming in the blue flame Raistlin clutched at him Help me find the spellbook he hissed Who cares about that Caramon roared reaching for his brother Ill get you out of here Raistlins mouth twisted so in fury and frustration that he could not speak He dropped to his knees and began to search frantically through the pile of treasure Caramon tried to draw him away but Raistlin shoved him back with his frail hand And still the ringing sound pierced their ears Sturm felt tears of pain trickle down his cheeks Suddenly something crashed to the floor in front of the knight The chamber ceiling was collapsing The entire building shook around them the ringing sound causing the pillars to tremble and the walls to crack Then the ringing diedand with it the dragon Khisanth had vanished leaving behind nothing but a pile of smoldering ash Sturm gasped in relief but not for long As soon as the ringing sound ended he could hear the sounds of the palace caving in the cracking of the ceiling and the thuds and explosive crashes as huge stone slabs struck the floor Then out of the dust and noise Tanis appeared before him Blood trickled from a cut on the halfelfs cheek Sturm grabbed his friend and pulled him to the altar as another chunk of ceiling plummeted near them The whole city is collapsing Sturm yelled How do we get out Tanis shook his head The only way I know is back the way we came through that tunnel he shouted He ducked as another piece of ceiling crashed onto the empty altar Thatll be a death trap There must be another way Well find it Tanis said firmly He peered through the billowing dust Where are the others he asked Then turning he saw Raistlin and Caramon Tanis stared in horror and disgust at the mage scavenging among the treasure Then he saw a small figure tugging Raistlins sleeve Bupu Tanis made a lunge for her nearly scaring the gully dwarf witless She shrank back against Raistlin with a startled scream Weve got to get out of here Tanis roared He grabbed hold of Raistlins robes and dragged the slender young man to his feet Stop looting and get that gully dwarf of yours to show us the way out or so help me youll die by my hands Raistlins thin lips parted a ghastly smile as Tanis flung him back against the altar Bupu shrieked Cornel We go I know way Raist Caramon begged you cant find it Youll die if we dont get out of here Very well the mage snarled He lifted the Staff of Magius from the altar and stood up reaching out his arm for his brothers aid Bupu show us the way he commanded Raistlin light your staff so we can follow you Tanis ordered Im going to find the others Over there Caramon said grimly Youre going to need help with the Plainsman Tanis flung his arm over his face as more stone fell then jumped across the rubble He found Riverwind collapsed where Goldmoon had been standing Flint and Tasslehoff trying to get the Plainsman to his feet There was nothing there now except a large area of blackened stone Goldmoon had been totally consumed in the flames Is he alive Tanis shouted Yes Tas answered his voice carrying shrilly above the noise But he wont move Ill talk to him Tanis said Follow the others Well be there in a moment Go on Tasslehoff hesitated but Flint after a glance at Taniss face put his hand on the kenders arm Snuffling Tas turned and began running through the rubble with the dwarf Tanis knelt beside Riverwind then the halfelf glanced up as Sturm appeared out of the gloom Go on Tanis said Youre in command now Sturm hesitated A column toppled over near them showering them in rock dust Tanis flung his body across Riverwinds Go on he yelled at Sturm Im holding you responsible Sturm drew a breath laid a hand on Taniss shoulder then ran toward the light from Raistlins staff The knight found the others huddled in a narrow hallway The arched ceiling above them seemed to be holding together but Sturm could hear thudding sounds above The ground shook beneath their feet and little rivulets of water were beginning to seep through new cracks in the walls Wheres Tanis Caramon asked Hell be along Stunn said harshly Well wait a few moments at least He did not mention that he would wait until waiting had dissolved into death There was a shattering crack Water began to gush through the wall flooding the floor Sturm was about to order the others out when a figure emerged from the collapsing doorway It was Riverwind carrying Taniss inert body in his arms What happened Sturm leaped forward his throat constricting Hes not He stayed with me Riverwind said softly I told him to leave me I wanted to diethere with her Thena slab of stone He never saw it Ill carry him Caramon said No Riverwind glared at the big warrior His arms gripped Taniss body tighter I will carry him We must go Yes This way We go now urged the gully dwarf She led them out of the city that was dying a second time They emerged from the dragons lair into the plaza which was rapidly being submerged as Newsea poured into the crumbling cavern The companions waded across holding onto each other to keep from being swept away in the vicious current Howling gully dwarves swarmed everywhere in a state of wild confusion some getting caught in the current others climbing up into the top stories of shaking buildings still others dashing down the streets Sturm could think of only one way out Go east he shouted gesturing down the broad street that led to the waterfall He looked anxiously at Riverwind The dazed Plainsman seemed oblivious to the commotion around him Tanis was unconsciousmaybe dead Fear chilled Sturms blood but he forcibly suppressed all emotions The knight ran ahead catching up with the twins Our only chance is the lift he yelled Caramon nodded slowly It will mean a fight Yes damn it said Sturm in exasperation envisioning all of the draconians trying to leave this stricken city It will mean a fight You got any better ideas Caramon shook his head At a corner Sturm waited to herd his limping exhausted band in the right direction Peering through the dust and mist he could see the lift ahead of them It was as he had foreseen surrounded by a dark writhing mass of draconians Fortunately they were all intent on escape They had to strike quickly Sturm knew to catch the creatures off guard Timing was critical He caught hold of the kender as Tas scurried past Tas he yelled Were going up the lift Tasslehoff nodded to show he understood then made a face to imitate a draconian and slashed his hand across his throat When we get near Sturm shouted sneak around to where you can see the pot descending When it starts to come down signal me Well attack when it reaches the ground Tasslehoffs topknot bobbed Tell Flint Sturm finished his voice nearly gone from shouting Tas nodded again and raced off to find the dwarf Sturm straightened his aching back with a sigh and continued on down the street He could see about twenty or twentyfive draconians gathered in the courtyard watching for the pot that would carry them to safety to begin its descent Sturm imagined the confusion up on the top draconians whipping and bullying the panicstricken gully dwarves forcing them into the lift He hoped the confusion would last Sturm saw the brothers in the shadows at the edge of the courtyard He joined them glancing up nervously as a stone slab crashed down behind him As Riverwind staggered out of the mist and dust Sturm started to help him but the Plainsman looked at the knight as if he had never seen him before in his life Bring Tanis over here Sturm said You can lay him down and rest a moment Were going up in the lift and well have a fight on our hands Wait here When we signal Do what you must Riverwind interrupted coldly He laid Taniss body gently on the ground and slumped down beside him burying his face in his hands Sturm hesitated He started to kneel down by Tanis as Flint came to stand by his side Go on Ill check on him the dwarf offered Sturm nodded thankfully He saw Tasslehoff skitter across the courtyard and into a doorway Looking toward the lift he saw the draconians yelling and cursing into the mist as if they could hurry the pots descent Flint poked Sturm in the ribs How are we going to fight all of them he shouted Were not Youre going to stay here with Riverwind and Tanis Sturm said Caramon and I can handle this he added wishing he believed it himself And I whispered the mage I still have my spells The knight did not answer He distrusted magic and he distrusted Raistlin Still he had no choiceCaramon would not go into battle without his brother by his side Tugging at his moustaches Sturm restlessly loosened his sword Caramon flexed his arms clenching and unclenching his huge hands Raistlin his eyes closed was lost in concentration Bupu hidden in a niche in the wall behind him watched everything with wide frightened eyes The pot swung into view gully dwarves hanging from its sides As Sturm hoped the draconians on the ground began to fight among themselves none wanting to be left behind Their panic increased as great cracks ran through the pavement toward them Water rose through the cracks The city of Xak Tsaroth would soon be lying at the bottom of Newsea As the pot touched ground the gully dwarves scurried over the sides and fled The draconians clambered in hitting and shoving each other Now the knight yelled Get out of my way the mage hissed Pulling a handful of sand from one of his pouches he sprinkled it on the ground and whispered Ast tasark sinuralan krynaw moving his right hand in an arc in the direction of the draconians First one then a few more blinked their eyes and slumped to the ground in sleep but others remained standing glancing around in alarm The mage ducked back into the doorway and seeing nothing the draconians turned back to the lift stepping on the bodies of their sleeping comrades in their frantic rush Raistlin leaned against the wall closing his eyes wearily How many he asked Only about six Caramon drew his sword from its sheath Just get in the damn pot Sturm yelled Well come back for Tanis when the fights ended Under cover of the mist the two warriors swords drawn covered the distance to the draconians within a few heartbeats Raistlin stumbling behind Sturm shouted his battlecry At the sound the draconians spun around in alarm And Riverwind raised his head The sound of battle penetrated Riverwinds fog of despair The Plainsman saw Goldmoon before him dying in the blue flame The dead expression left his face replaced by a ferocity so bestial and terrifying that Bupu still hiding in the doorway screamed in alarm Riverwind leaped to his feet He didnt even draw his sword but charged forward emptyhanded He tore into the ranks of the scrambling draconians like a starving panther and began to kill He killed with his bare hands twisting choking gouging Draconians stabbed at him with their swords soon his leather tunic was soaked with blood Yet he never stopped moving among them never stopped killing His face was that of a madman The draconians in Riverwinds path saw death in his eyes and they also saw that their weapons had no effect One broke and ran and soon another Sturm finishing an opponent looked up grimly prepared to find six more coming at him Instead he saw the enemy fleeing for their lives into the mist Riverwind covered with blood collapsed onto the ground The lift The mage pointed It was hovering about two feet off the ground and starting to move upward There were gully dwarves in the top pot coming down Stop it Sturm yelled Tasslehoff raced from his hiding place and leaped for the edge He clung his feet dangling trying desperately to keep the empty pot from rising Caramon Hang onto it Sturm ordered the warrior Ill get Tanis I can hold it but not for long The big man grunted grasping onto the edge and digging his feet into the ground He dragged the lift to a halt Tasslehoff climbed inside hoping his small body might add ballast Sturm ran back swiftly to Tanis Flint was beside him his axe in his hands Hes alive the dwarf called as the knight approached Sturm paused a moment to thank some god somewhere then he and Flint lifted the unconscious halfelf and carried him to the pot They placed him inside then returned for Riverwind It took four of them to get Riverwinds bloody body into the lift Tas tried without much success to stanch the wounds with one of his handkerchiefs Hurry Caramon gasped Despite all his efforts the pot was rising slowly Get in Sturm ordered Raistlin The mage glanced at him coldly and ran back into the mist Within moments he reappeared carrying Bupu in his arms The knight grabbed the trembling gully dwarf and flung her into the lift Bupu whimpering crouched on the bottom still clutching her bag to her chest Raistlin climbed over the side The pot continued to rise Caramons arms were nearly pulled out of their sockets Go on Sturm ordered Caramon the knight being the last to leave the field of battle as usual Caramon knew better than to argue He heaved himself up nearly tipping the pot over Flint and Raistlin dragged him in Without Caramon holding it the pot lunged upward rapidly Sturm caught hold of it with both hands and clung to the side as it rose into the air After two or three tries he managed to swing a leg over the edge and climbed in with Caramons help The knight knelt down beside Tanis and was relieved beyond expression to see the halfelf stir and moan Sturm grasped the halfelf and held him close You have no idea how glad I am youre back the knight said his voice husky Riverwind Tanis murmured groggily Hes here He saved your life He saved all our lives Sturm talked rapidly almost incoherently Were in the lift going up The citys destroyed Where are you hurt Broken ribs feels like Wincing in pain Tanis looked over at Riverwind still conscious despite his wounds Poor man Tanis said softly Goldmoon I saw her die Sturm There was nothing I could do Sturm helped the halfelf rise to his feet We have the Disks the knight said firmly It was what she wanted what she fought for Theyre in my pack Are you sure you can stand Yes Tanis said He drew a ragged painful breath We have the Disks whatever good that will do us They were interrupted by the shrill screams as the second pot gully dwarves flying like banners went past them The gully dwarves shook their fists and cursed the companions Bupu laughed then she stood up looking at Raistlin in concern The mage leaned wearily against the side of the pot his lips moving silently calling to mind another spell Sturm peered up through the mist I wonder how many will be at the top he asked Tanis too glanced up Most have fled I hope he said He caught his breath sharply and clutched at his ribs There was a sudden lurch The pot fell about a foot stopped with a jolt then slowly started to rise again The companions looked at each other in alarm The mechanism Its either starting to collapse or the draconians have recognized us and are trying to destroy it Tanis said Theres nothing we can do Sturm said in bitter frustration He stared down at the pack containing the Disks which lay at his feet Except pray to these gods The pot lurched and dropped again For a moment it hung suspended swaying in the mistshrouded air Then it started up moving slowly shuddering The companions could see the edge of the rock ledge and the opening above them The pot rose inch by creaking inch each of those inside mentally supporting every link of the chain that was carrying them up to Draconians cried Tas shrilly pointing up Two draconians stared down at them As the pot crept closer and closer Tanis saw the draconians crouch ready to jump Theyre going to leap down here The pot wont hold Flint rumbled Well crash That may be their intent Tanis said They have wings Stand back Raistlin said staggering to his feet Raist dont His brother caught hold of him Youre too weak I have strength for one more spell the mage whispered But it may not work If they see I am magi they may be able to resist my magic Hide behind Caramons shield Tanis said swiftly The big man thrust his body and his shield in front of his brother The mist swirled around them concealing them from draconian eyes but also preventing them from seeing the draconians The pot rose inch by inch the chain creaking and lurching upwards Raistlin stood poised behind Caramons shield his strange eyes staring waiting for the mists to part Cool air touched Taniss cheek A breeze swirled the mists apart just for an instant The draconians were so close they could have almost touched them The draconians saw them at the same time One spread its wings and floated down toward the pot sword in hand shrieking in triumph Raistlin spoke Caramon moved his shield and the mage spread his thin fingers A ball of white shot from his hands hitting the draconian squarely in the chest The ball exploded covering the creature in sticky webbing Its cry of triumph changed to a horrifying shriek as the webbing tangled its wings It plummeted into the mist its body striking the edge of the iron pot as it fell The pot began to rock and sway Theres still one more Raistlin gasped sinking to his knees Hold me up Caramon help me stand The mage began to cough violently blood trickling from his mouth Raist his brother pleaded dropping his shield and catching his fainting twin Stop Theres nothing you can do Youll kill yourself A look of command was enough The warrior supported his brother as the mage began to speak again the eeriesounding language of magic The remaining draconian hesitated still hearing the yells of its fallen companion It knew the human was a magicuser It also knew that it could probably resist the magic But this human facing it was like no human magicuser it had ever encountered The humans body seemed weak practically to the point of death but a strong aura of power surrounded him The mage raised his hand pointing at the creature The draconian cast one last vicious glance at the companions then turned and fled Raistlin unconscious sank in his brothers arms as the pot completed its journey to the surface Bupus gift An ominous sight Just as they pulled Riverwind out of the lift a sharp tremor shook the floor of the Hall of the Ancestors The companions dragging Riverwind with them scrambled back as the floor cracked The floor gave way and tumbled down carrying the great wheel and the iron pots down into the mist below This whole place is caving in Caramon shouted in alarm holding his brother in his arms Run Back to the temple of Mishakal Tanis gasped with pain Trusting in the gods again huh Flint said Tanis could not answer Sturm took hold of Riverwinds arms and started to lift him but the Plainsman shook his head and shoved him away My wounds are not serious I can manage Leave me He remained slumped on the shattered floor Tanis glanced questioningly at Sturm The knight shrugged The Solamnic Knights considered suicide noble and honorable The elves considered it blasphemy The halfelf took hold of the Plainsmans long dark hair and jerked his head back so that the startled man was forced to look into Taniss eyes Go ahead Lie down and die Tanis said through clenched teeth Shame your chieftain She at least had the courage to fight Riverwinds eyes smoldered He caught hold of Taniss wrist and flung the halfelf away from him with such force that Tanis staggered into the wall groaning in agony The Plainsman stood up staring at Tanis with hatred Then he turned and stumbled down the shaking corridor his head bent Sturm helped Tanis to his feet the halfelf dizzy from the pain They followed the others as fast as they could The floor tilted crazily When Sturm slipped they crashed against a wall A sarcophagus slid out into the hallway spilling its grisly contents A skull rolled over by Taniss feet startling the halfelf who fell to his knees He feared he might faint from the pain Go he tried to say to Sturm but he couldnt talk The knight picked him up and together they staggered on through the dustchoked corridor At the foot of the stairs called the Paths of the Dead they found Tasslehoff waiting The others Sturm gasped coughing in the dust Theyve already gone up to the temple Tasslehoff said Caramon told me to wait here for you Flint says the temples safe dwarven stonework you know Raistlins conscious He said it was safe too Something about being held in the palm of the goddess Riverwinds there He glared at me I think he could have killed me But he made it up the stairs All right Tanis said to stop the prattling Enough Put me down Sturm Ive got to rest a minute or Ill pass out Take Tas and ill meet you upstairs Go on damn it Sturm grabbed Tasslehoff by the collar and dragged him up stairs Tanis sank back Sweat chilled his body every breath was agony Suddenly the remainder of the floor in the Hall of the Ancestors collapsed with a loud snapping noise The Temple of Mishakal trembled and shook Tanis staggered to his feet then he paused a moment Faintly behind him he could now hear the low thundering rumble of water surging Newsea had claimed Xak Tsaroth The city that was dead was now buried Tanis emerged slowly from the stairwell into the circular room at the top The climb had been a nightmare each new step a miracle The chamber was blessedly quiet the only sound the harsh breathing of his friends who had made it that far and collapsed He too could go no farther The halfelf glanced around to make certain the others were all right Sturm had set down the pack containing the Disks and was slumped against a wall Raistlin lay on a bench his eyes closed his breathing quick and shallow Of course Caramon sat beside him his face dark with anxiety Tasslehoff sat at the bottom of the pedestal staring up at the top Flint leaned against the doors too tired to grumble Wheres Riverwind Tanis asked He saw Caramon and Sturm exchange glances then lower their eyes Tanis staggered up anger defeating his pain Sturm rose and blocked his path Its his decision Tanis It is the way of his people as it is the way of mine Tanis shoved the knight aside and walked toward the double doors Flint did not move Get out of my way the halfelf said his voice shaking Flint looked up the lines of grief and sorrow etched by a hundred years softened the dwarfs scowling expression Tanis saw in Flints eyes the accumulated wisdom that had drawn an unhappy halfhuman halfelven boy into a strange and lasting friendship with a dwarf Sit down lad Flint said in a gentle voice as if he too remembered their origins If your elven head cannot understand then listen to your human heart for once Tanis shut his eyes tears stinging his lids Then he heard a great cry from inside the templeRiverwind Tanis thrust the dwarf aside and pushed open the huge golden doors Striding rapidly ignoring his pain he threw open the second set of doors and entered the chamber of Mishakal Once again he felt peace and tranquility flood over him but now the feeings only added to his anger over what had happened I cannot believe in you Tanis cried What kind of gods are you that you demand a human sacrifice You are the same gods who brought the Cataclysm down on man All rightso youre powerful Now leave us alone We dont need you The halfelf wept Through his tears he could see that Riverwind sword in hand knelt before the statue Tanis stumbled forward hoping to prevent the act of selfdestruction Tanis rounded the base of the statue and stopped stunned For a minute he refused to believe his own sense of sight perhaps grief and pain were playing tricks on his mind He lifted his eyes to the statues beautiful calm face and steadied his reeling confused senses Then he looked again Goldmoon lay there sound asleep her breast rising and falling with the rhythm of her quiet breathing Her silvergold hair had come loose from its braid and drifted around her face in the gentle wind that filled the chamber with the fragrance of spring The staff was once again part of the marble statue but Tanis saw that now Goldmoon wore around her throat the necklace that had once adorned the statue I am a true cleric now Goldmoon said softly I am a disciple of Mishakal and though I have much to learn I have the power of my faith Above all else I am a healer I bring the gift of healing back into the land Reaching out her hand Goldmoon touched Tanis on the forehead whispering a prayer to Mishakal The halfelf felt peace and strength flow through his body cleansing his spirit and healing his wounds Weve got a cleric now Flint said and thatll come in handy But from what we hear this Lord Verminaards a cleric too and a powerful one at that We may have found the ancient gods of good but he found the ancient gods of evil a lot sooner I dont see how these Disks are going to help much against hordes of dragons You are right Goldmoon said softly I am not a warrior I am a healer I do not have the power to unite the peoples of our world to fight this evil and restore the balance My duty is to find the person who has the strength and the wisdom for this task I am to give the Disks of Mishakal to that person The companions were silent for long moments Then We must leave here Tanis Raistlin hissed from out of the shadows of the Temple where he stood staring out the door into the courtyard Listen Horns They could all hear the shrill braying of many many horns carried on the north wind The armies said Tanis softly War has begun The companions fled Xak Tsaroth into the twilight They traveled west toward the mountains The air was cold with the bite of early winter Dead leaves blown by chill winds flew past their faces They decided to head for Solace planning to stock up on supplies and gather what information they could before determining where to go in their search for a leader Tanis could foresee arguments along those lines Already Sturm was talking of Solamnia Goldmoon mentioned Haven while Tanis himself was thinking the Disks of Mishakal would be safest in the elven kingdom Discussing vague plans they traveled on well into the night They saw no draconians and supposed that those escaping Xak Tsaroth had traveled north to join up with the armies of this Lord Verminaard Dragon Highmaster The silver moon rose then the red The companions climbed high the sound of the horns driving them on past the point of exhaustion They made camp on the summit of the mountain After eating a cheerless supper not daring to light a fire they set the watch then slept Raistlin woke in the cold gray hour before dawn He had heard something Had he been dreaming No there it was againthe sound of someone crying Goldmoon the mage thought irritably and started to lie back down Then he saw Bupu curled in a ball of misery blubbering into a blanket Raistlin glanced around The others were asleep except for Flint standing watch on the other side of camp The dwarf had apparently heard nothing and he wasnt looking in Raistlins direction The mage stood up and padded softly over Kneeling down beside the gully dwarf he laid his hand on her shoulder What is it little one Bupu rolled over to face him Her eyes were red her nose swollen Tears streaked down her dirty face She snuffled and wiped her hand across her nose I dont want to leave you I want to go with you she said brokenly butohI will miss my people Sobbing she buried her face in her hands A look of infinite tenderness touched Raistlins face a look no one in his world would ever see He reached out and stroked Bupu s coarse hair knowing what it felt like to be weak and miserable an object of ridicule and pity Bupu he said you have been a good and true friend to me You saved my life and the lives of those I care about Now you will do one last thing for me little one Go back I must travel roads that will be dark and dangerous before the end of my long journey I cannot ask you to go with me Bupu lifted her head her eyes brightening Then a shadow tell across her face But you will be unhappy without me No Raistlin said smiling My happiness will lie in knowing you are safely back with your people You sure Bupu asked anxiously I am sure Raistlin answered Then I go Bupu stood up But first you take gift She began to rummage around in her bag No little one Raistlin began remembering the dead lizard thats not necessary The words caught in his throat as he watched Bupu pull from her baga book He stared in amazement seeing the pale light of the chill morning illuminate silver runes on a nightblue leather binding Raistlin reached out a trembling hand The spellbook of Fistandantilus he breathed You like Bupu said shyly Yes little one Raistlin took the precious object in his hands and held it lovingly stroking the leather Where I take from dragon Bupu said when blue light shine I glad you like Now I go Find Highbulp Phudge I the great She slung her bag over her shoulder Then she stopped and turned That coughyou sure you not want lizard cure No thank you little one Raistlin said rising Bupu looked at him sadly thengreatly daringshe caught his hand in hers and kissed it swiftly She turned away her head bowed sobbing bitterly Raistlin stepped forward He laid his hand on her head If I have any power at all Great One he said inside himself power that has not yet been revealed to me grant that this little one goes through her life in safety and happiness Farewell Bupu he said softly She stared at him with wide adoring eyes then turned and ran off as fast as her floppy shoes would carry her What was all that about Flint said stumping over from the other side of the camp Oh he added seeing Bupu running off So you got rid of your pet gully dwarf Raistlin did not answer but simply stared at Flint with a malevolence that made the dwarf shiver and walk hurriedly away The mage held the spellbook in his hands admiring it He longed to open it and revel in its treasures but he knew that long weeks of study lay ahead of him before he could even read the new spells much less acquire them And with the spells would come more power He sighed in ecstasy and hugged the book to his thin chest Then he slipped it swiftly into his pack with his own spellbook The others would be waking soonlet them wonder how he got the book Raistlin stood up glancing out to the west to his homeland where the sky was brightening with the early morning sun Suddenly he stiffened Then dropping his pack he ran across the camp and knelt down beside the halfelf Tanis Raistlin hissed Wake up Tanis woke and grabbed his dagger What Raistlin pointed to the west Tanis blinked trying to focus his sleepscummed eyes The view from the top of the mountain where they were camped was magnificent He could see the tall trees give way to the grassy Plains And beyond the Plains snaking up into the sky No Tanis choked He gripped the mage No it cant be Yes Raistlin whispered Solace is burning BOOK Night of the dragons Tika wrung the rag out in the pail and watched dully as the water turned black She threw the rag down on the bar and started to lift the bucket to carry it back to the kitchen to draw more water Then she thought why bother Picking up the rag she began to mop the tables again When she thought Otik wasnt watching she wiped her eyes with her apron But Otik was watching His pudgy hands took hold of Tikas shoulders and gently turned her around Tika gave a choking sob and laid her head on his shoulder Im sorry Tika sobbed but I cant get this clean Otik knew of course that this wasnt the real reason the girl was weeping but it came close He patted her back gently I know I know child Dont cry I understand Its this damn soot Tika wailed It covers everything with black and every day I scrub it up and the next day its back They keep burning and burning Dont worry about it Tika Otik said stroking her hair Be thankful the Inns in one piece Be thankful Tika pushed away from him her face flushed No I wish it had burned like everything else in Solace then they wouldnt come in here I wish it had burned I wish it had burned Tika sank down at the table sobbing uncontrollably Otik hovered around her I know my dear I know he repeated smoothing the puffy sleeves of the blouse Tika had taken such pride in keeping clean and white Now it was dingy and covered with soot like everything in the ravaged town The attack on Solace had come without warning Even when the first pitiable refugees began to trickle into the town from the north telling horror stories of huge winged monsters Hederick the High Theocrat assured the people of Solace that they were safe their town would be spared And the people believed him because they wanted to believe him And then came the night of the dragons The Inn was crowded that night one of the few places people could go and not be reminded of the storm clouds hanging low in the northern skies The fire burned brightly the ale was rich the spiced potatoes were delicious Yet even here the outside world intruded everyone talked loudly and fearfully of war Hedericks words soothed their fearful hearts We are not like these reckless fools to the north who made the mistake of defying the might of the Dragon Highlords he called out standing on a chair to be heard Lord Verminaard has personally assured the Council of Highseekers in Haven that he wants only peace He seeks permission to move his armies through our town so that he may conquer the elflands to the south And I say more power to him Hederick paused for scattered cheering and applause We have tolerated the elves in Qualinesti too long I say let this Verminaard drive them back to Silvanost or wherever they came from In factHederick warmed to his subjectsome of you young men might consider joining the armies of this great lord And he is a great lord I have met him He is a true cleric I have seen the miracles he has performed We will enter a new age under his leadership We will drive the elves dwarves and other foreigners from our land and There came a low dull roaring sound like the gathering of the waters of a mighty ocean Silence fell abruptly Everyone listened puzzled trying to figure out what might make such a noise Hederick aware that he had lost his audience glanced around in irritation The roaring sound grew louder and louder coming closer Suddenly the Inn was plunged into thick smothering darkness A few people screamed Most ran for the windows trying to peer out the few clear panes scattered among the colored glass Go down and find out whats going on someone said Its so blasted dark I cant see the stairs someone else muttered And then it was no longer dark Flames exploded outside the Inn A wave of heat hit the building with force enough to shatter windows showering those inside with glass The mighty vallenwood treewhich no storm on Krynn had ever stirredbegan to sway and rock from the blast The Inn tilted Tables scooted sideways benches slid down the floor to slam up against the wall Hederick lost his balance and tumbled off his chair Hot coals spewed from the fireplace as oil lamps from the ceiling and candles from the tables started small fires A highpitched shriek rose above the noise and confusion the scream of some living creaturea scream filled with hatred and cruelty The roaring noise passed over the Inn There was a rush of wind then the darkness lifted as a wall of flame sprang up to the south Tika dropped a tray of mugs to the floor as she grabbed desperately at the bar for support People around her shouted and screamed some in pain some with terror Solace was burning A lurid orange glow lit the room Clouds of black smoke rolled in through the broken windows Smells of blazing wood filled Tikas nostrils along with a more horrible smell the smell of burned flesh Tika choked and looked up to see small flames licking the great limbs of the vallenwood that held up the ceiling Sounds of varnish sizzling and popping in the heat mingled with the screams of the injured Douse those fires Otik was yelling wildly The kitchen The cook screamed as she flew out of the swinging doors her clothes smoldering a solid wall of flame behind her Tika grabbed a pitcher of ale from the bar and tossed it on the cooks dress and held her still to drench he clothes Rhea sank into a chair weeping hysterically Get out The whole placell go up someone shouted Hederick pushing past the injured was one of the first to reach the door He ran onto the Inns front landing then stopped stunned and gripped the rail for support Staring northward he saw the woods blazing and by the ghastly light of the flames he could see hundreds of marching creatures the lurid firelight reflecting off their leathery wings Draconian ground troops He watched horrified as the front ranks poured into the city of Solace knowing there must be thousands more behind them And above them flew creatures out of the stories of children Dragons Five red dragons wheeled overhead in the flamelit sky First one then another dove down incinerating parts of the small town with its fiery breath casting the thick magical darkness It was impossible to fight them warriors could not see well enough to aim their arrows or strike with their swords The rest of the night blurred in Tikas memory She kept telling herself she must leave the burning Inn yet the Inn was her home she felt safe there and so she stayed though the heat from the flaming kitchen grew so intense it hurt her lungs to breathe Just when the flames spread to the common room the kitchen crashed to the ground Otik and the barmaids flung buckets of ale on the flames in the common room until finally the fire was extinguished Once the fire was out Tika turned her attention to the wounded Otik collapsed in a comer shaking and sobbing Tika sent one of the other barmaids to tend to him while she began treating the injured She worked for hours resolutely refusing to look out of the windows blocking from her mind the awful sounds of death and destruction outside Suddenly it occured to her that there was no end to the wounded that more people were lying on the floor than had been in the Inn when it was attacked Dazed she looked up to see people straggling in Wives helped their husbands Husbands carried their wives Mothers carried dying children Whats going on Tika asked a Seeker guard who staggered in clutching his arm where an arrow had penetrated it Others pushed behind him Whats happening Why are these people coming here The guard looked at her with dull painfilled eyes This is the only building he mumbled All burning All No Tika went limp with shock and her knees trembled At that moment the guard fainted in her arms and she was forced to pull herself together The last thing she saw as she dragged him inside was Hederick standing on the porch staring out over the flaming town with glazed eyes Tears streamed unheeded down his sootstreaked face Theres been a mistake he whimpered wringing his hands Theres been a mistake made somewhere That had been a week ago As it turned out the Inn was not the only building left standing The draconians knew which buildings were essential to their needs and destroyed all those that were not The Inn Theros Ironfelds blacksmith shop and the general store were saved The blacksmith shop had always been on the groundbecause of the inadvisability of having the hot forge located in a treebut the others had to be lowered to the ground because the draconians found it difficult to get into the trees Lord Verminaard ordered the dragons to lower the buildings After a space had been scorched clear one of the huge red monsters stuck his claws into the Inn and lifted it The draconians cheered as the dragon dropped it not gently onto the blackened grass Fewmaster Toede in charge of the town ordered Otik to repair the Inn immediately The draconians had one great weaknessa thirst for strong drink Three days after the town was taken the Inn reopened Im all right now Tika told Otik She sat up and dried her eyes wiping her nose with her apron I havent cried once since that night she said more to herself than to him Her lips tightened into a thin line And Ill never cry again she swore rising from the table Otik not understanding but thankful that Tika had regained her composure before the patrons arrived bustled back behind the bar Nearly opening time he said trying to sound cheerful Maybe well have a good crowd today How can you take their money Tika flared Otik fearing another outburst looked at her pleadingly Their money is as good as anyone elses Better than most these days he said Humpf Tika snorted Her thick red curls quivered as she stalked angrily across the floor Otik knowing her temper stepped backwards It didnt help He was caught She jabbed her finger into his fat stomach How can you laugh at their crude jokes and cater to their whims she demanded I hate the stench of them I hate their leers and their cold scaly hands touching mine Someday Ill Tika please Otik begged Have some regard for me Im too old to be carried off to the slave mines And youtheyd take you tomorrow if you didnt work here Please behave theres a good girl Tika bit her lip in anger and frustration She knew Otik was right She risked more than being sent off in the slave caravans that passed through town almost dailyan angered draconian killed swiftly and without mercy Just as she was thinking this the door banged open and six draconian guards swaggered in One of the them pulled the CLOSED sign off the door and tossed it into a corner Youre open the creature said dropping into a chair Yes certainly Otic grinned weakly Tika I see them Tika said dully The stranger Captured The crowd at the Inn that night was sparse The patrons were now draconians though occasional Solace residents came in for a drink They generally did not stay long finding the company unpleasant and memories of former times hard to bear Tonight there was a group of hobgoblins who kept wary eyes on the draconians and three crudely dressed humans from the north Originally impressed into Lord Verminaards service they now fought for the sheer pleasure of killing and looting A few Solace citizens sat huddled in a corner Hederick the Theocrat was not in his nightly spot Lord Verminaard had rewarded the High Theocrats service by placing him among the first to be sent to the slave mines Near dusk a stranger entered the Inn taking a table in a dark corner near the door Tika couldnt tell much about himhe was heavily cloaked and wore a hood pulled low over his head He seemed fatigued sinking down into his chair as though his legs would not support him What will you have Tika asked the stranger The man lowered his head pulling down one side of his hood with a slender hand Nothing thank you he said in a soft accented voice Is it permissible to sit here and rest Im supposed to meet someone How about a glass of ale while you wait Tika smiled The man glanced up and she saw brown eyes flash from the depths of his hood Very well the stranger said I am thirsty Bring me your ale Tika headed for the bar As she drew the ale she heard more customers entering the Inn Just a half second she called out unable to turn around Sit anywhere youve a mind Ill be with you soon as I can She glanced over her shoulder at the newcomers and nearly dropped the mug Tika gasped then got a grip on herself Dont give them away Sit down anywhere strangers she said loudly One of the men a big fellow seemed about to speak Tika frowned fiercely at him and shook her head Her eyes shifted to the draconians seated in the center of the room A bearded man led the group past the draconians who examined the strangers with a great deal of interest They saw four men and a woman a dwarf and a kender The men were dressed in mudstained cloaks and boots One was unusually tall another unusually big The woman was cloaked in furs and walked with her hand through the arm of the tall man All of them seemed downcast and tired One of the men coughed and leaned heavily upon a strangelooking staff They crossed the room and sat down at a table in the far comer More refugee scum sneered a draconian The humans look healthy though and all know dwarves are hard workers Wonder why they havent been shipped out They will be soon as the Fewmaster sees them Perhaps we should take care of the matter now said a third scowling in the direction of the eight strangers Naw Im off duty They wont go far The others laughed and returned to their drinking A number of empty glasses already sat before each of them Tika carried the ale to the browneyed stranger set it before him hurriedly then bustled back to the newcomers Whatll you have she asked coldly The tall bearded man answered in a low husky voice Ale and food he said And wine for him he nodded at the man who was coughing almost continually The frail man shook his head Hot water he whispered Tika nodded and left Out of habit she started back toward where the old kitchen had been Then remembering it was gone she whipped around and headed for the makeshift kitchen that had been built by goblins under draconian supervision Once inside she astounded the cook by grabbing the entire skillet of fried spiced potatoes and carrying it back out into the common room Ale all around and a mug of hot water she called to Dezra behind the bar Tika blessed her stars that Otik had gone home early Itrum take that table She motioned to the hobgoblins as she hurried back to the newcomers She slammed the skillet down glancing at the draconians Seeing them absorbed in their drinking she suddenly flung her arms around the big man and gave him a kiss that made him flush Oh Caramon she whispered swiftly I knew youd come back for me Take me with you Please please Now there there Caramon said patting her awkwardly on the back and looking pleadingly at Tanis The halfelf swiftly intervened his eyes on the draconians Tika calm down he told her Weve got an audience Right she said briskly and stood up smoothing her apron Handing plates around she began to ladle out the spiced potates as Dezra brought the ale and hot water Tell us what happened to Solace Tanis said his voice choked Quickly Tika whispered the story as she filled everyones plate giving Caramon a double portion The companions listened in grim silence And so Tika concluded every week the slave caravans leave for Pax Tharkas except now theyve taken almost everyoneleaving only the skilled like Theros Ironfeld behind I fear for him She lowered her voice He swore to me last night that he would work for them no more It all started with that captive party of elves Elves What are elves doing here Tanis asked speaking too loudly in his astonishment The draconians turned to stare at him the hooded stranger in the corner raised his head Tanis hunched down and waited until the draconians turned their attention to their drinks Then he started to ask Tika more about the elves At that moment a draconian yelled for ale Tika sighed I better go She set the skillet down Ill leave that here Finish them off The companions ate listlessly the food tasting like ashes Raistlin mixed his strange herbal brew and drank it down his cough improved almost immediately Caramon watched Tika as he ate his expression thoughtful He could still feel the warmth of her body as she had embraced him and the softness of her lips Pleasant sensations flowed through him and he wondered if the stories he had heard about Tika were true The thought both saddened him and made him angry One of the draconians raised its voice We may not be men like youre accustomed to sweetie it said drunkenly flinging its scaled arm around Tikas waist But that doesnt mean we cant find ways of making you happy Caramon rumbled deep in his chest Sturm overhearing glowered and put his hand on his sword Catching hold of the knights arm Tanis said urgently Both of you stop it Were in an occupied town Be sensible This is no time for chivalry You too Caramon Tika can handle herself Sure enough Tika slipped deftly out of the draconian s grip and flounced angrily into the kitchen Well what do we do now Flint grumbled We came back to Solace for supplies and find nothing but draconians My house is little more than a cinder Tanis doesnt even have a vallenwood tree much less a home All weve got are platinum Disks of some ancient goddess and a sick mage with a few new spells He ignored Raistlins glower We cant eat the Disks and the magician hasnt learned to conjure up food so even if we knew where to go wed starve before we got there Should we still go to Haven Goldmoon asked looking up at Tanis What if it is as bad as this How do we know the Highseeker Council is even in existence I dont have the answers Tanis said sighing He rubbed his eyes with his hand But I think we should try to reach Qualinesti Tasslehoff bored by the conversation yawned and leaned back in his chair It didnt matter to him where they went Examining the Inn with intense interest he wanted to get up and look at where the kitchen had burned but Tanis had warned him before they entered to stay out of trouble The kender contented himself with studying the other customers He immediately noticed the hooded and cloaked stranger in the front of the Inn watching them intently as the conversation among the companions grew heated Tanis raised his voice and the word Qualinesti rang out again The stranger set down his mug of ale with a thud Tas was just about to call Taniss attention to this when Tika came out of the kitchen and slammed food down in front of the draconians skillfully avoiding their clawed hands Then she walked back over to the group Could I have some more potatoes Caramon asked Of course Tika smiled at him and picked up the skillet to return to the kitchen Caramon felt Raistlins eyes on him He flushed and began to play with his fork In Qualinest Tanis reiterated his voice rising as he contested a point with Sturm who wanted to go north Tas saw the stranger in the corner rise and start walking toward them Tanis company the kender said softly The conversation ceased Their eyes on their tankards all of them could feel and hear the approach of the stranger Tanis cursed himself for not noticing him sooner The draconians however had noticed the stranger Just as he reached the creatures table one of the draconians stuck out its clawed foot The stranger tripped over it stumbling headlong into a nearby table The creatures laughed loudly Then a draconian caught a glimpse of the strangers face Elf the draconian hissed pulling off the hood to reveal the almondshaped eyes slanted ears and delicate masculine features of an elflord Let me pass the elf said backing up his hands raised I was only going to exchange a word of greeting with these travelers Youll exchange a word of greeting with the Fewmaster elf the draconian snarled Jumping up and grabbing the strangers cloak collar the creature shoved the elf back up against the bar The other two draconians laughed loudly Tika on her way back to the kitchen with the skillet stalked over toward the draconians Stop this she cried taking hold of one of the draconians by the arm Leave him alone Hes a paying customer Same as you Go about your business girl The draconian shoved Tika aside then grabbed the elf with a clawed hand and hit him twice across the face The blows drew blood When the draconian let go the elf staggered shook his head groggily Ah kill him shouted one of the humans from the north Make him screech like the others Ill cut his slanty eyes out of his head thats what Ill do The draconian drew his sword This has gone far enough Sturm rushed forward the others behind him though all feared there was little hope of saving the elfthey were too far from him But help was closer With a shrill cry of rage Tika Waylan brought her heavy iron skillet down on the draconians head There was a loud clunking sound The draconian stared stupidly at Tika for an instant then slithered to the floor The elf jumped forward drawing a knife as the other two draconians leaped for Tika Sturm reached her side and clubbed one of the draconians with his sword Caramon caught the other up in his great arms and tossed it over the bar Riverwind Dont let them out the door Tanis cried seeing the hobgoblins leap up The Plainsman caught one hobgoblin as it put its hand on the doorknob but another escaped his grasp They could hear it shouting for the guard Tika still wielding her skillet thunked a hobgoblin over the head But another hobgoblin seeing Caramon charge over leaped out of the window Goldmoon rose to her feet Use your magic she said to Raistlin grabbing him by the arm Do something The mage looked at the woman coldly It is hopeless he whispered I will not waste my strength Goldmoon glared at him in fury but he had returned to his drink Biting her lip she ran over to Riverwind the pouch with the precious Disks of Mishakal in her arms She could hear horns blowing wildly in the streets Weve got to get out of here Tanis said but at that moment one of the human fighters wrapped his arms around Taniss neck dragging him to the floor Tasslehoff with a wild shout leaped onto the bar and began flinging mugs at the halfelfs attacker narrowly missing Tanis in the process Flint stood in the midst of the chaos staring at the elven stranger I know you he yelled suddenly Tanis isnt this A mug hit the dwarf in the head knocking him cold Oops said Tas Tanis throttled the northerner and left him unconscious under a table He grabbed Tas off the bar set the kender on the floor and knelt down beside Flint who was groaning and trying to sit up Tanis that elf Flint blinked groggily then asked What hit me That big guy under the table Tas said pointing Tanis stood up and looked at the elf Flint indicated Gilthanas The elf stared at him Tanthalas he said coldly I would never have recognized you That beard Horns blew again this time closer Great Reorx The dwarf groaned staggering to his feet Weve got to get out of here Come on Out the back There is no back Tika cried wildly still hanging onto the skillet No said a voice at the door There is no back You are my prisoners A blaze of torchlight flared into the room The companions shielded their eyes making out the forms of hobgoblins behind a squat figure in the doorway The companions could hear the sounds of flapping feet outside then what seemed like a hundred goblins stared into the windows and peered in through the door The hobgoblins inside the bar that were still alive or conscious picked themselves up and drew their weapons regarding the companions hungrily Sturm dont be a fool Tanis cried catching hold of the knight as he prepared to charge into the seething mass of goblins slowly forming a ring of steel around them We surrender the halfelf called out Sturm glared at the halfelf in anger and for a moment Tanis thought he might disobey Please Sturm Tanis said quietly Trust me This is not our time to die Sturm hesitated glanced around at the goblins crowding inside the Inn They stood back fearful of his sword and his skill but he knew they would charge in a rush if he made the slightest move It is not our time to die What odd words Why had Tanis said them Did a man ever have a time to die If so Sturm realized thiswasnt itnot if he could help it There was no glory dying in an Inn trampled by stinking flapping goblin feet Seeing the knight put his weapon away the figure at the door decided it was safe to enter surrounded as he was by a hundred or so loyal troops The companions saw the gray mottled skin and red squinting pig eyes of Fewmaster Toede Tasslehoff gulped and moved quickly to stand beside Tanis Surely he wont recognize us Tas whispered It was dusk when they stopped us asking about the staff Apparently Toede did not recognize them A lot had happened in a weeks time and the Fewmaster had important things stuffed in a mind already overloaded His red eyes focused on the knights emblems beneath Sturms cloak More refugee scum from Solamnia Toede remarked Yes Tanis lied quickly He doubted if Toede knew of the destruction of Xak Tsaroth He thought it highly unlikely that this fewmaster would know anything about the Disks of Mishakal But Lord Verminaard knew of the Disks and he would soon learn of the dragons death Even a gully dwarf could add that one up No one must know they came out of the east We have journeyed long days from the north We did not intend to cause trouble These draconians started it Yes yes Toede said impatiently Ive heard this before His squinty eyes suddenly narrowed Hey you he shouted pointing at Raistlin What are you doing skulking back there Fetch him lads The Fewmaster took a nervous step behind the door watching Raistlin warily Several goblins charged back overturning benches and tables to reach the frail young man Caramon rumbled deep in his chest Tanis gestured to the warrior warning him to remain calm On yer feet one of the goblins snarled prodding at Raistlin with a spear Raistlin stood slowly and carefully gathered his pouches As he reached for his staff the goblin grabbed hold of the mages thin shoulder Touch me not Raistlin hissed drawing back I am magi The goblin hesitated and glanced back at Toede Take him yelled the Fewmaster moving behind a very large goblin Bring him here with the others If every man wearing red robes was a magician this countryd be overrun with rabbits If he wont come peaceably stick him Maybe Ill stick him anyway the goblin croaked The creature held the tip of its spear up to the mages throat gurgling with laughter Again Tanis held back Caramon Your brother can take care of himself he whispered swiftly Raistlin raised his hands fingers spread as though to surrender Suddenly he spoke the words Kalith karan tobaniskar and pointed his fingers at the goblin Small brightly glowing darts made of pure white light beamed from the mages fingertips streaked through the air and embedded themselves deep in the goblins chest The creature fell over with a shriek and lay writhing on the floor As the smell of burning flesh and hair filled the room other goblins sprang forward howling in rage Dont kill him you fools Toede yelled The Fewmaster had backed clear out the door keeping the big goblin in front of him as cover Lord Verminaard pays a handsome bounty for magicusers ButToede was inspiredthe Lord does not pay a bounty for live kenders only their tongues Do that again magician and the kender dies What is the kender to me Raistlin snarled There was a long heartbeat of silence in the room Tanis felt cold sweat chill him Raistlin could certainly take care of himself Damn the mage That was certainly not the answer Toede had expected either and it left him not quite knowing what to doespecially since these big warriors still had their weapons He looked almost pleadingly at Raistlin The magician appeared to shrug I will come peacefully Raistlin whispered his golden eyes gleaming Just do not touch me No of course not Toede muttered Bring him The goblins casting uneasy glances in the direction of the Fewmaster allowed the mage to stand beside his brother Is that everyone demanded Toede irritably Then take their weapons and their packs Tanis hoping to avoid more trouble pulled his bow from his shoulder and laid it and his quiver on the sootblackened floor of the Inn Tasslehoff quickly laid down his hoopak the dwarfgrumblingadded his battleaxe The others followed Taniss lead except Sturm who stood his arms folded across his chest and Please let me keep my pack Goldmoon said I have no weapons in it nothing of value to you I swear The companions turned to face hereach remembering the precious Disks she carried A strained tense silence fell Riverwind stepped in front of Goldmoon He had laid his bow down but he still wore his sword as did the knight Suddenly Raistlin intervened The mage had laid down his staff his pouches of spell components and the precious bag that contained his spellbooks He was not worried about thesespells of protection had been laid on the books anyone other than their owner attempting to read them would go insane and the Staff of Magius was quite capable of taking care of itself Raistlin held out his hands toward Goldmoon Give them the pack he said gently Otherwise they will kill us Listen to him my dear called out Toede hastily Hes an intelligent man Hes a traitor cried Goldmoon clutching the pack Give them the pack Raistlin repeated hypnotically Goldmoon felt herself weakening felt his strange power breaking her No She choked This is our hope It will be all right Raistlin whispered staring intently into her clear blue eyes Remember the staff Remember when I touched it Goldmoon blinked Yes she murmured It shocked you Hush Raistlin warned swiftly Give them the pouch Do not worry All will be well The gods protect their own Goldmoon stared at the mage then nodded reluctantly Raistlin reached out his thin hands to take the pouch from her Fewmaster Toede stared at it greedily wondering what was in it He would find out but not in front of all these goblins Finally there was only one person left who had not obeyed the command Sturm stood unmoving his face pale his eyes glittering feverishly He held his fathers ancient twohanded sword tightly Suddenly Sturm turned shocked to feel Raistlins burning fingers on his arm I will insure its safety the mage whispered How the knight asked withdrawing from Raistlins touch as from a poisonous snake I do not explain my ways to you Raistlin hissed Trust me or not as you choose Sturm hesitated This is ridiculous shrieked Toede Kill the knight Kill them if they cause more trouble Im losing sleep Very well Sturm said in a strangled voice Walking over he reverently laid the sword down on the pile of weapons Its ancient silver scabbard decorated with the kingfisher and rose gleamed in the light Ah truly a beautiful weapon Toede said He had a sudden vision of himself walking into audience with Lord Verminaard the sword of a Solamnic knight hanging at his side Perhaps I should take that into custody myself Bring it Before he could finish Raistlin stepped forward swiftly and knelt beside the pile of weapons A bright flash of light sprang from the mages hand Raistlin closed his eyes and began to murmur strange words holding his outstretched hands above the weapons and packs Stop him yelled Toede But none dared Finally Raistlin ceased speaking and his head slumped forward His brother hurried to help Raistlin stood Know this the mage said his golden eyes staring around the common room I have cast a spell upon our belongings Anyone who touches them will be slowly devoured by the great worm Catyrpelius who will rise from the Abyss and suck the blood from your veins until you are nothing more than a dried husk The great worm Catyrpelius breathed Tasselehoff his eyes shining Thats incredible Ive never heard of Tanis clapped his hand over the kenders mouth The goblins backed away from the pile of weapons which seemed to almost glow with a green aura Get those weapons somebody ordered Toede in a rage You get em muttered a goblin No one moved Toede was at a loss Although he was not particularly imaginative a vivid picture of the great worm Catyrpelius reared up in his mind Very well he muttered take the prisoners away Load them into the cages And bring those weapons too or youll wish that worm whatsitsname was sucking your blood Toede stomped off angrily The goblins began to shove their prisoners toward the door prodding them in the back with their swords None however touched Raistlin Thats a wonderful spell Raist Caramon said in a low voice How effective is it Could it Its about as effective as your wit Raistlin whispered and held up his right hand As Caramon saw the telltale black marks of flashpowder he smiled grimly in sudden understanding Tanis was the last to leave the Inn He cast a final look around A single light swung from the ceiling Tables were overturned chairs broken The beams of the ceiling were blackened from the fires in some cases burned through completely The windows were covered with greasy black soot I almost wish I had died before I saw this The last thing he heard as he left were two hobgoblin captains arguing heatedly about who was going to move the enchanted weapons The slave caravan A strange old magician The companions spent a chill sleepless night penned up in an ironbarred cage on wheels in the Solace Town Square Three cages were chained to one of the posts driven into the ground around the clearing The wooden posts were black from flame and heat the bases scorched and splintered No living thing grew in the clearing even the rocks were black and melted When day dawned they could see other prisoners in the other cages The last slave caravan leaving Solace for Pax Tharkas it was to be personally led by the Fewmaster himself Toede having decided to take this opportunity to impress Lord Verminaard who was in residence at Pax Tharkas Caramon tried once during the cover of night to bend the bars of the cage and had to give up A cold mist arose in the early morning hours hiding the ravaged town from the companions Tanis glanced over at Goldmoon and Riverwind Now I understand them Tanis thought Now I know the cold emptiness inside that hurts worse than any swordthrust My home is gone He glanced over at Gilthanas huddled in a corner The elf had spoken to no one that night excusing himself by begging that his head hurt and he was tired But Tanis who had kept watch all through the night saw that Gilthanas did not sleep or even make a pretence of sleeping He gnawed his lower lip and stared out into the darkness The sight reminded Tanis that he hadif he chose to claim itanother place he could call home Qualinesti No Tanis thought leaning against the bars Qualinesti was never home It was simply a place I lived Fewmaster Toede emerged from the mist rubbing his fat hands together and grinning widely as he regarded the slave caravan with pride There may be a promotion here A fine catch considering pickings were drying up in this burnedout shell of a town Lord Verminaard should be pleased especially with this last batch That large warrior particularlyan excellent specimen He could probably do the work of three men in the mines The tall barbarian would do nicely too Probably have to kill the knight thoughthe Solamnics were notoriously uncooperative But Lord Verminaard will certainly enjoy the two femalesvery different but both lovely Toede himself had always been attracted to the redhaired barmaid with her alluring green eyes the lowcut white blouse purposefully revealing just enough of her lightlyfreckled skin to tantalize a man with thoughts of what lay beyond The Fewmasters reveries were interrupted by the sound of clashing steel and hoarse shouts floating eerily through the mist The shouts grew louder and louder Soon almost everyone in the slave caravan was awake and peering through the fog trying to see Toede cast an uneasy glance at the prisoners and wished hed kept a few more guards handy The goblins seeing the prisoners stir jumped to their feet and trained their bows and arrows on the wagons What is this Toede grumbled aloud Cant those fools even take one prisoner without all this turmoil Suddenly a cry bellowed above the noise It was the cry of a man in torment and pain but whose rage surpassed all else Gilthanas stood up his face pale I know that voice he said Theros Ironfeld I feared this Hes been helping elves escape ever since the slaughter This Lord Verminaard has sworn to exterminate the elves Gilthanas watched Taniss reactionor didnt you know No Tanis said shocked I didnt know How could I Gilthanas fell silent studying Tanis for long moments Forgive me he said at last It appears I have misjudged you I thought perhaps that was why you had grown the beard Never Tanis leaped up How dare you accuse me Tanis cautioned Sturm The halfelf turned to see the goblin guards crowding foward their arrows trained at his heart Raising his hands he stepped back to his place just as a squadron of hobgoblins dragged a tall powerfully built man into sight I heard Theros had been betrayed Gilthanas said softly I returned to warn him But for him I never would have escaped Solace alive I was supposed to meet him in the Inn last night When he did not come I was afraid Fewmaster Toede threw open the door to the companions cage yelling and gesturing for the hobgoblins to hurry their prisoner forward The goblins kept the other prisoners covered while the hobgoblins threw Theros into the cage Fewmaster Toede slammed the door shut quickly Thats it he yelled Hitch up the beasts Were moving out Squads of goblins drove huge elk into the clearing and began hitching them to wagons Their yelling and the confusion registered only in the back of Taniss mind For the moment his shocked attention was on the smith Theros Ironfeld lay unconscious on the strawcovered floor of the cage Where his strong right arm should have been was a mangled stump His arm had been hacked off apparently by some blunt weapon just below the shoulder Blood poured from the terrible wound and pooled on the floor of the cage Let that be a lesson to all those who help elves The Fewmaster peered in the cage his red pig eyes squinching in their pouches of fat He wont be forging anything ever again unless it be a new arm I eh A huge elk lumbered into the Fewmaster forcing him to scramble for his life Toede turned on the creature leading the elk Sestun You oaf Toede knocked the smaller creature to the ground Tasslehoff stared down at the creature thinking it was a very short goblin Then he saw it was a gully dwarf dressed in a goblins armor The gully dwarf picked himself up shoved his oversized helm back and glared after the Fewmaster who was waddling up to the front of the caravan Scowling the gully dwarf began kicking mud in his direction This apparently relieved his soul for he soon quit and returned to prodding the slow elk into line My faithful friend Gilthanas murmured bending over Theros and taking the smiths strong black hand in his You have paid for your loyalty with your life Theros looked at him with vacant eyes clearly not hearing the elfs voice Gilthanas tried to stanch the dreadful wound but blood continued to pump onto the floor of the cart The smithys life was emptying before their eyes No said Goldmoon coming to kneel beside the smith He need not die I am a healer Lady Gilthanas said impatiently there exists no healer on Krynn who could help this man He has lost more blood than the dwarf has in his whole body His lifeboat is so faint I can barely feel it The kindest thing to do is let him die in peace without any of your barbarian rituals Goldmoon ignored him Placing her hand upon Theross forehead she closed her eyes Mishakal she prayed beloved goddess of healing grace this man with your blessing If his destiny be not fulfilled heal him that he may live and serve the cause of truth Gilthanas began to remonstrate once more reaching out to pull Goldmoon away Then he stopped and stared in amazement Blood ceased to drain from the smiths wound and even as the elf watched the flesh began to close over it Warmth returned to the smiths dusky black skin his breathing grew peaceful and easy and he appeared to drift into a healthful relaxed sleep There were gasps and murmurs of astonishment from the other prisoners in the nearby cages Tanis glanced around fearfully to see if any of the goblins or draconians had noticed but apparently they were all preoccupied with hitching the recalcitrant elk to the wagons Gilthanas subsided back into his corner his eyes on Goldmoon his expression thoughtful Tasslehoff pile up some of that straw Tanis instructed Caramon you and Sturm help me move him to a corner Here Riverwind offered his cloak Take this to cover him from the chill Goldmoon made certain Theros was comfortable then returned to her place beside Riverwind Her face radiated a peace and calm serenity that made it seem as if the reptilian creatures on the outside of the cage were the true prisoners It was nearly noon before the caravan got under way Goblins came by and threw some food into the cages hunks of meat and bread No one not even Caramon could eat the rancid stinking meat and they threw it back out But they devoured the bread hungrily having eaten nothing since last nightfall Soon Toede had everything in order and riding by on his shaggy pony gave the orders to move out The gully dwarf Sestun trotted after Toede Seeing the hunk of meat lying in the mud and filth outside the cage the gully dwarf stopped grabbed it eagerly and crammed it into his mouth Each wheeled cage was pulled by four elk Two hobgoblins sat high on crude wooden platforms one holding the reins of the elk the other a whip and a sword Toede took his place at the front of the line followed by about fifty draconians dressed in armor and heavily armed Another troop of about twice as many hobgoblins fell into line behind the cages After a great deal of confusion and swearing the caravan finally lurched forward Some of the remaining residents of Solace stared at them as they drove off If they knew anyone among the prisoners they made no sound or gesture of farewell The faces both inside and outside the cages were the faces of those who no longer can feel pain Like Tika they had vowed never to cry again The caravan traveled south from Solace down the old road through Gateway Pass The hobgoblins and draconians grumbled about traveling in the heat of the day but they cheered upand moved faster once they marched into the shade of the Passs high canyon walls Although the prisoners were chilled in the canyon they had their own reasons for being grateful they no longer had to look upon their ravaged homeland It was evening by the time they left the canyons winding roads and reached Gateway The prisoners strained against the bars for some glimpse of the thriving market town But now only two low stone walls melted and blackened marked where the town might have once stood No living creature stirred The prisoners sank back in misery Once more out in the open country the draconians announced their preference for traveling by night out of the suns light Consequently the caravan made only brief stops until dawn Sleep was impossible in the filthy cages jolting and jouncing over every rut in the road The prisoners suffered from thirst and hunger Those who managed to gag down the food the draconians tossed them soon vomited it back up They were given only small cups of water two or three times a day Goldmoon remained near the injured smithy Although Theros Ironfeld was no longer at the point of death he was still very ill He developed a high fever and in his delirium he raved about the sacking of Solace Theros spoke of draconians whose bodies when dead turned into pools of acid burning the flesh of their victims and of draconians whose bones exploded after death destroying everything within a wide radius Tanis listened to the smith relive horror after horror until he felt sick For the first time Tanis realized the enormity of the situation How could they hope to fight dragons whose breath could kill whose magic exceeded that of all but the most powerful magicusers who had ever lived How could they defeat vast armies of these draconians when even the corpses of the creatures had the power to kill All we have Tanis thought bitterly are the Disks of Mishakaland what good are they He had examined the Disks during their journey from Xak Tsaroth to Solace He had been able to read little of what was written however Although Goldmoon had been able to understand those words that pertained to the healing arts she could decipher little more All will be made clear to the leader of the people she said with steadfast faith My calling now is to find him Tanis wished he could share her faith but as they traveled through the ravaged countryside he began to doubt that any leader could defeat the might of this Lord Verminaard These doubts merely compounded the halfelfs other problems Raistlin bereft of his medicine coughed until he was nearly in as bad a state as Theros and Goldmoon had two patients on her hands Fortunately Tika helped the Plainswoman tend the mage Tika whose father had been a magician of sorts held anyone who could work magic in awe In fact it was Tikas father who inadvertently introduced Raistlin to his calling Raistlins father took the twin boys and his stepdaughter Kitiara to the local Summers End festival where the children watched the Wonderful Waylan perform his illusions Eightyearold Caramon was soon bored and readily agreed to accompany his teenage halfsister to the event that attracted herthe swordplay Raistlin thin and frail even then had no use for such active sports He spent the entire day watching Waylan the Illusionist When the family returned home that evening Raistlin astounded them by being able to duplicate flawlessly every trick The next day his father took the boy to study with one of the great masters of the magic arts Tika had always admired Raistlin and she had been impressed by the stories she heard about his mysterious journey to the fabled Towers of High Sorcery Now she helped care for the mage out of respect and her own innate need to help those weaker than herself She also tended him she admitted privately to herself because her deeds won a smile of gratitude and approval from Raistlins handsome twin brother Tanis wasnt certain which to worry about mostthe worsening condition of the mage or the growing romance between the older experienced soldier and the young andTanis believed despite gossip to the contrary inexperienced vulnerable barmaid He had another problem as well Sturm humiliated at being taken prisoner and hauled through the countryside like an animal to slaughter lapsed into a deep depression from which Tanis thought he might never escape Sturm either sat all day staring out between the bars orperhaps worsehe lapsed into periods of deep sleep from which he could not be wakened Finally Tanis had to cope with his own inner turmoil physically manifested by the elf sitting in the comer of the cage Every time he looked at Gilthanas Taniss memories of his home in Qualinesti haunted him As they neared his homeland the memories he had thought long buried and forgotten crept into his mind their touch every bit as chilling as the touch of the undead in Darken Wood Gilthanas childhood friendmore than friend brother Raised in the same household and close to the same age the two had played and fought and laughed together When Gilthanass little sister grew old enough the boys allowed the captivating blonde child to join them One of the threesomes greatest delights was teasing the older brother Porthios a strong and serious youth who took on the responsibilities and sorrows of his people at an early age Gilthanas Laurana and Porthios were the children of the Speaker of the Suns the ruler of the elves of Qualinesti a position Porthios would inherit at his fathers death Some in the elven kingdom thought it odd that the Speaker would take into his house the bastard son of his dead brothers wife after she had been raped by a human warrior She had died of grief only months after the birth of her halfbreed child But the Speaker who had strong views on responsibility took in the child without hesitation It was only in later years as he watched with growing unease the developing relationship between his beloved daughter and the bastard halfelf that he began to regret his decision The situation confused Tanis as well Being halfhuman the young man acquired a maturity the slower developing elf maid could not understand Tanis saw the unhappiness their union must bring down upon the family he loved He also was beset by the inner turmoil that would torment him in later life the constant battle between the elvish and the human within him At the age of eightyabout twenty in human yearsTanis left Qualinost The Speaker was not sorry to see Tanis leave He tried to hide his feelings from the young halfelf but both of them knew it Gilthanas had not been so tactful He and Tanis had exchanged bitter words over Laurana It was years before the sting of those words faded and Tanis wondered if he had ever truly forgotten or forgiven Clearly Gilthanas had done neither The journey for these two was very long Tanis made a few attempts at desultory conversation and became immediately aware that Gilthanas had changed The young elflord had always been open and honest funloving and lighthearted He did not envy his older brother the responsibilities inherent in his role as heir to the throne Gilthanas was a scholar a dabbler in the magic arts though he never took them as seriously as Raistlin He was an excellent warrior though he disliked fighting as do all elves He was deeply devoted to his family especially his sister But now he sat silent and moody an unusual characteristic in elves The only time he showed any interest in anything was when Caramon had begun plotting an escape Gilthanas told him sharply to forget it he would ruin everything When pressed to elaborate the elf fell silent muttering only something about overwhelming odds By sunrise of the third day the draconian army was flagging from the nights long march and looking forward to a rest The companions had spent another sleepless night and looked forward to nothing but another chill and dismal day But the cages suddenly rolled to a stop Tanis glanced up puzzled at the change in routine The other prisoners roused themselves and looked out the cage bars They saw an old man dressed in long robes that once might have been white and a battered pointed hat He appeared to be talking to a tree I say did you hear me The old man shook a worn walking stick at the oak I said move and I meant it I was sitting on that rockhe pointed to a boulderenjoying the rising sun on my old bones when you had the nerve to cast a shadow over it and chill me Move this instant I say The tree did not respond It also did not move I wont take any more of your insolence The old man began to beat on the tree with his stick Move or IllIll Someone shut that looney in a cage Fewmaster Toede shouted galloping back from the front of the caravan Get your hands off me the old man shrieked at the draconians who ran up and accosted him He beat on them feebly with his staff until they took it away from him Arrest the tree he insisted Obstructing sunlight Thats the charge The draconians threw the old man roughly into the companions cage Tripping over his robes he fell to the floor Are you all right Old One Riverwind asked as he assisted the old man to a seat Goldmoon left Theross side Yes Old One she said softly Are you hurt I am a cleric of Mishakal he said peering at the amulet around her neck How very interesting My my He stared at her in astonishment You dont look three hundred years old Goldmoon blinked uncertain how to react How did you know Did you recognize Im not three hundred She was growing confused Of course youre not Im sorry my dear The old man patted her hand Never bring up a ladys age in public Forgive me It wont happen again Our little secret he said in a piercing whisper Tas and Tika started to giggle The old man looked around Kind of you to stop and offer me a lift The road to Qualinost is long Were not going to Qualinost Gilthanas said sharply Were prisoners going to the slave mines of Pax Tharkas Oh the old man glanced around vaguely Is there another group due by here soon then I could have sworn this was the one What is your name Old One Tika asked My name The old man hesitated frowning Fizban Yes thats it Fizban Fizban Tasslehoff repeated as the cage lurched to a start again Thats not a name Isnt it the old man asked wistfully Thats too bad I was rather fond of it I think its a splendid name Tika said glaring at Tas The kender subsided into a corner his eyes on the pouches slung over the old mans shoulder Suddenly Raistlin began to cough and they all turned their attention to him His coughing spasms had been growing worse and worse He was exhausted and in obvious pain his skin burned to the touch Goldmoon was unable to help him Whatever was burning the mage up inside the cleric could not heal Caramon knelt beside him wiping away the bloody saliva that flecked his brothers lips Hes got to have that stuff he drinks Caramon looked up in anguish Ive never seen him this bad If they wont listen to reason the big man scowledIll break their heads I dont care how many there are Well talk to them when we stop for the night Tanis promised though he could guess the Fewmasters answer Excuse me the old man said May I Fizban sat down beside Raistlin He laid his hand on the mages head and sternly spoke a few words Caramon listening closely heard Fistandan and not the time Certainly it wasnt a healing prayer such as Goldmoon had tried but the big man saw that his brother responded The response was astonishing however Raistlins eyes fluttered and opened He looked up at the old man with a wild expression of terror and grasped Fizbans wrist in his thin frail hand For an instant it seemed Raistlin knew the old man then Fizban passed his hand over the mages eyes The look of terror subsided replaced by confusion Hullo Fizban beamed at him NamesuhFizban He shot a stern glance at Tasslehoff daring the kender to laugh You are magi Raistlin whispered His cough was gone Why yes I suppose I am I am magi Raistlin said struggling to sit up No kidding Fizban seemed immensely tickled Small world Krynn Ill have to teach you a few of my spells I have one a fireball lets see how did that go The old man rambled on long past the time the caravan stopped at the rising of the sun Rescue Fizbans magic Raistlin suffered in body Sturm suffered in mind but perhaps the one who experienced the keenest suffering during the companions fourday imprisonment was Tasslehoff The cruelest form of torture one can inflict on a kender is to lock him up Of course it is also widely believed that the crudest form of torture one can inflict on any other species is to lock them up with a kender After three days of Tasslehoff s incessant chatter pranks and practical jokes the companions would have willingly traded the kender for a peaceful hour of being stretched on the rackat least thats what Flint said Finally after even Goldmoon lost her temper and nearly slapped him Tanis sent Tasslehoff to the back of the cart His legs hanging over the edge the kender pressed his face against the iron bars and thought he would die of misery He had never been so bored in his entire life Things got interesting with the discovery of Fizban but the old mans amusement value wore thin when Tanis made Tas return the old magicians pouches And so driven to the point of desperation Tasslehoff latched onto a new diversion Sestun the gully dwarf The companions generally regarded Sestun with amused pity The gully dwarf was the object of Toedes ridicule and mistreatment He ran the Fewmasters errands all night long carrying messages from Toede at the front of the caravan to the hobgoblin captain at the rear lugging food up to the Fewmaster from the supply cart feeding and watering the Fewmasters pony and any other nasty jobs the Fewmaster could devise Toede knocked him flat at least three times a day the draconians tormented him and the hobgoblins stole his food Even the elk kicked at him whenever he trotted past The gully dwarf bore it all with such a grimly defiant spirit that it won him the sympathy of the companions Sestun began to stay near the companions when not busy Tanis eager for information about Pax Tharkas asked him about his homeland and how he came to work for the Fewmaster The story took over a day for Sestun to relate and another day for the companions to piece together since he started in the middle and plunged headlong into the beginning What it amounted to eventually wasnt much help Sestun was among a large group of gully dwarves living in the hills around Pax Tharkas when Lord Verminaard and his draconians captured the iron mines which he needed to make steel weapons for his troops Big fireall day all night Bad smell Sestun wrinkled his nose Pound rock All day all night I get good job in kitchenhis face brightened a momentfix hot soup Very hot His face fell Spill soup Hot soup heat up armor real fast Lord Verminaard sleep on back for week He sighed I go with Fewmaster Me volunteer Maybe we can shut the mines down Caramon suggested Thats a thought Tanis mused How many draconians does Lord Verminaard have guarding the mines Two Sestun said holding up ten grubby fingers Tanis sighed remembering where they had heard that before Sestun looked at him hopefully There be only two dragons too Two dragons Tanis said incredulously Not more than two Caramon groaned and settled back The warrior had been giving dragon fighting serious thought ever since Xak Tsaroth He and Sturm had reviewed every tale about Huma the only known dragon fighter the knight could remember Unfortunately no one had ever taken the legends of Huma seriously before except the Solamnic Knights for which they were ridiculed so much of Humas tale had been distorted by time or forgotten A knight of truth and power who called down the gods themselves and forged the mighty Dragonlance Caramon murmured now glancing at Sturm who lay asleep on the strawcovered floor of their prison Dragonlance muttered Fizban waking with a snort Dragonlance Who said anything about the Dragonlance My brother Raistlin whispered smiling bitterly Quoting the Canticle It seems he and the knight have taken a fancy to childrens stories that have come to haunt them Good story Huma and the Dragonlance said the old man stroking his beard Storythats all it is Caramon yawned and scratched his chest Who knows if its real or if the Dragonlance was real or if even Huma was real We know the dragons are real Raistlin murmured Huma was real Fizban said softly And so was the Dragonlance The old mans face grew sad Was it Caramon sat up Can you describe it Of course Fizban sniffed disdainfully Everyone was listening now Fizban was in fact a bit disconcerted by his audience It was a weapon similiar tono it wasnt Actually it wasno it wasnt that either It was closer to almost a rather it was sort of alance thats it A lance He nodded earnestly And it was quite good against dragons Im taking a nap Caramon grumbled Tanis smiled and shook his head Sitting back against the bars he wearily closed his eyes Soon everyone except Raistlin and Tasslehoff fell into a fitful sleep The kender wide awake and bored looked at Raistlin hopefully Sometimes if Raistlin was in a good mood he would tell stories about magicusers of old But the mage wrapped in his red robes was staring curiously at Fizban The old man sat on a bench snoring gently his head bobbing up and down as the cart jounced over the road Raistlins golden eyes narrowed to gleaming slits as though he had been struck by a new and disturbing thought After a moment he pulled his hood up over his head and leaned back his face lost in the shadows Tasslehoff sighed Then glancing around he saw Sestun walking near the cage The kender brightened Here he knew was an appreciative audience for his stories Tasslehoff calling him over began to relate one of his own personal favorites The two moons sank The prisoners slept The hobgoblins trailed along behind halfasleep talking about making camp soon Fewmaster Toede rode up ahead dreaming about promotion Behind the Fewmaster the draconians muttered among themselves in their harsh language casting baleful glances at Toede when he wasnt looking Tasslehoff sat swinging his legs over the side of the cage talking to SestunThe kender noticed without seeming to that Gilthanaswas only pretending to sleep Tas saw the elfs eyes open and glance quickly around when he thought no one was watching This intrigued Tas immensely It seemed almost as if Gilthanas was watching or waiting for something The kender lost the thread of his story And so I uh grabbed a rock from my pouch threw it andthunkhit the wizard right on the head Tas finished hurriedly The demon grabbed the wizard by the foot and dragged him down into the depths of the Abyss But first demon thank you prompted Sestun who had heard this storywith variationstwice before You forgot Did I Tas asked keeping an eye on Gilthanas Well yes the demon thanked me and took away the magic ring hed given me If it wasnt dark you could see the outline the ring burned on my finger Sun uping Morning soon I see then the gully dwarf said eagerly It was still dark but a faint light in the east hinted that soon the sun would be rising on the fourth day of their journey Suddenly Tas heard a bird call in the woods Several answered it What oddsounding birds Tas thought Never heard their like before But then hed never been this far south before He knew where they were from one of his many maps They had passed over the only bridge across the Whiterage River and were heading south toward Pax Tharkas which was marked on the kenders map as the site of the famed Thadarkan iron mines The land began to rise and thick forests of aspens appeared to the west The draconians and hobgoblins kept eyeing the forests and their pace picked up Concealed within these woods was Qualinesti the ancient elvenhome Another bird called much nearer now Then the hair rose on Tasslehoffs neck as the same bird call sounded from right behind him The kender turned to see Gilthanas on his feet his fingers to his lips an eerie whistle splitting the air Tanis Tas yelled but the halfelf was already awake So was everyone in the cart Fizban sat up yawned and glanced around Oh good he said mildly the elves are here What elveswhere Tanis sat up There was a sudden whirring sound like a covey of quail taking flight A cry rang out from the supply wagon in front of them then there was a splintering sound as the wagon now driverless lurched into a rut and tipped over The driver of their cage wagon pulled sharply on the reins stopping the elk before they ran into the wrecked supply wagon The cage tipped precariously sending the prisoners sprawling The driver got the elk going again and guided them around the wreckage Suddenly the driver of the cage screamed and clutched at his neck where the companions saw the feathered shaft of an arrow silhouetted against the dimly lit morning sky The drivers body tumbled from the seat The other guard stood up sword raised then he too toppled forward with an arrow in his chest The elk reeling the reins go slack slowed until the cage rolled to a halt Cries and screams echoed up and down the caravan as arrows whizzed through the air The companions fell for cover face first on the floor of the cage What is it Whats going on Tanis asked Gilthanas But the elf ignoring him peered through the dawn gloom into the forest Porthios he called Tanis whats happening Sturm sat up speaking his first words in four days Porthios is Gilthanass brother I take it this is a rescue Tanis said An arrow zipped past and lodged in the wooden side of the cart narrowly missing the knight It wont be much of a rescue if we end up dead Sturm dropped to the floor I thought elves were expert marksmen Keep low Gilthanas ordered The arrows are only to cover our escape This is a strikeandrun raid My people are not capable of attacking a large body directly We must be ready to run for the woods And how do we get out of these cages Sturm demanded We cannot do everything for you Gilthanas replied coldly There are magicusers I cannot work without my spell components Raistlin hissed from beneath a bench Keep down Old One he said to Fizban who head raised was looking around with interest Perhaps I can help the old magician said his eyes brightening Now let me think What in the name of the Abyss is going on roared a voice out of the darkness Fewmaster Toede appeared galloping on his pony Why have we stopped We under attack Sestun cried crawling out from under the cage where hed taken cover Attack BIyxtshok Get this cart moving Toede shouted An arrow thunked into the Fewmasters saddle Toedes red eyes flew open and he stared fearfully into the woods Were under attack Elves Trying to free the prisoners Driver and guard dead Sestun shouted flattening himself against the cage as another arrow just missed him What me do An arrow zipped over Toedes head Ducking he had to clutch his ponys neck to keep himself from falling off Ill get another driver he said hastily You stay here Guard these prisoners with your life Ill hold you responsible if they escape The Fewmaster stuck his spurs into his pony and the fear crazed animal leaped forward My guard Hobgoblins To me the Fewmaster yelled as he galloped to the rear of the line His shouts echoed back Hundreds of elves Were surrounded Charge to the north I must report this to Lord Verminaard Toede reined in at the sight of a draconian captain You draconians tend to the prisoners He spurred his horse on still shouting and one hundred hobgoblins charged after their valiant leader away from the battle Soon they were completely out of sight Well that takes care of the hobgoblins Sturm said his face relaxing in a smile Now all we have left to worry about is fifty or so draconians I dont suppose by the way that there are hundreds of elves out there Gilthanas shook his head More like twenty Tika lying flat on the floor cautiously raised her head and looked south In the pale morning light she could see the hulking forms of the draconians about a mile ahead leaping into the cover on either side of the road as the elven archers moved down to fire into their ranks She touched Taniss arm pointing Weve got to get out of this cage Tanis said looking back The draconians wont bother taking us to Pax Tharkas now that the Fewmasters gone Theyll just butcher us in these cages Caramon Ill try the fighter rumbled He stood and gripped the bars of the cage in his huge hands Closing his eyes he took a deep breath and tried to force the bars apart His face reddened the muscles in his arms bunched the knuckles on his big hands turned white It was useless Gasping for breath Caramon flattened himself on the floor Sestun Tasslehoff cried Your axe Break the lock The gully dwarfs eyes opened wide He stared at the companions then he glanced down the trail the Fewmaster had taken His face twisted in an agony of indecision Sestun Tasslehoff began An arrow zinged past the kender The draconians behind them were moving forward firing into the cages Tas flattened himself on the floor Sestun he began again help free us and you can come with us A look of firm resolve hardened Sestuns features He reached for his axe which he wore strapped onto his back The companions watched in nailbiting frustration as Sestun felt all around his shoulders for the axe which was located squarely in the middle of his back Finally one hand discovered the handle and he pulled the axe out The blade glinted in the gray light of dawn Flint saw it and groaned That axe is older than I am It must date back to the Cataclysm He probably couldnt cut through a kenders brain let alone that lock Hush Tanis instructed although his own hopes sank at the sight of the gully dwarfs weapon It wasnt even a battleaxe just a small battered rusty woodcutting axe the gully dwarf had apparently picked up somewhere thinking it was a weapon Sestun tucked the axe between his knees and spat on his hands Arrows thunked and clattered around the bars of the cage One struck Caramons shield Another pinned Tikas blouse to the side of the cage grazing her arm Tika couldnt remember being more terrified in her lifenot even the night dragons struck Solace She wanted to scream she wanted Caramon to put his arm around her But Caramon didnt dare move Tika caught sight of Goldmoon shielding the injured Theros with her body her face pale but calm Tika pressed her lips together and drew a deep breath Grimly she yanked the arrow out of the wood and tossed it to the floor ignoring the stinging pain in her arm Looking south she saw that the draconians momentarily confused by the sudden attack and the disappearance of Toede were organized now on their feet and running toward the cages Their arrows filled the air Their chest armor gleamed in the dim gray light of morning so did the bright steel of their longswords which they carried clamped in their jaws as they ran Draconians closing in she reported to Tanis trying to keep her voice from shaking Hurry Sestun Tanis shouted The gully dwarf gripped the axe swung it with all his might and missed the lock striking the iron bars a blow that nearly jarred the axe from his hands Shrugging apologetically he swung again This time he struck the lock He didnt even dent it Sturm reported Tanis Tika quavered pointing Several draconians were within ten feet of them pinned down for a few moments by the elven archers but all hope of rescue seemed lost Sestun struck the lock again He chipped it Sturm said in exasperation At this rate well be out in about three days What are those elves doing anyway Why dont they quit skulking about and attack We dont have enough men to attack a force this size Gilthanas returned angrily crouching next to the knight Theyll get to us when they can We are at the front of the line See others are escaping The elf pointed to the two wagons behind them The elves had broken the locks and the prisoners were dashing madly for the woods as the elves covered them darting out from the trees to let fly their deadly barrage of arrows But once the prisoners were safe the elves retreated into the trees The draconians had no intention of going into the elven woods after them Their eyes were on the last prison cage and the wagon containing the prisoners possessions The companions could hear the shouts of the draconian captains The meaning was clear Kill the prisoners Divide the spoils Everyone could see that the draconians would reach them long before the elves did Tanis swore in frustration Everything seemed futile He felt a stirring at his side The old magician Fizban was getting to his feet No Old One Raistlin grasped at Fizbans robes Keep under cover An arrow zipped through the air and stuck in the old mans bent and battered hat Fizban muttering to himself did not seem to notice He presented a wonderful target in the gray light Draconian arrows flew around him like wasps and seemed to have as little effect although he did appear mildly annoyed when one stuck into a pouch he happened to have his hand in at the moment Get down Caramon roared Youre drawing their fire Fizban did kneel down for a moment but it was only to talk to Raistlin Say there my boy he said as an arrow flew past right where hed been standing Have you got a bit of bat guano on you Im out No Old One Raistlin whispered frantically Get down No Pity Well I guess Ill have to wing it The old magician stood up planted his feet firmly on the floor and rolled up the sleeves of his robes He shut his eyes pointed at the cage door and began to mumble strange words What spell is he casting Tanis asked Raistlin Can you understand The young mage listened intently his brow furrowed Suddenly Raistlins eyes opened wide NO he shrieked trying to pull on the old magicians robe to break his concentration But it was too late Fizban said the final word and pointed his finger at the lock on the back door of the cage Take cover Raistlin threw himself beneath a bench Sestun seeing the old magician point at the cage doorand at him on the other side of itfell flat on his face Three draconians reaching the cage door their weapons dripping with their saliva skidded to a halt staring up in alarm What is it Tanis yelled Fireball Raistlin gasped and at that moment a gigantic ball of yelloworange fire shot from the old magicians fingertips and struck the cage door with an explosive boom Tanis buried his face in his hands as flames billowed and crackled around him A wave of heat washed over him searing his lungs He heard the draconians scream in pain and smelled burning reptile flesh Then smoke flew down his throat The floors on fire Caramon yelled Tanis opened his eyes and staggered to his feet He expected to see the old magician nothing but a mound of black ash like the bodies of the draconians lying behind the wagon But Fizban stood staring at the iron door stroking his singed beard in dismay The door was still shut That really should have worked he said What about the lock Tanis yelled trying to see through the smoke The iron bars of the cell door already glowed red hot It didnt budge Sturm shouted He tried to approach the cage door to kick it open but the heat radiating from the bars made it impossible The lock may be hot enough to break He choked in the smoke Sestun Tasslehoffs shrill voice rose above the crackling flames Try again Hurry The gully dwarf staggered to his feet swung the axe missed swung again and hit the lock The superheated metal shattered the lock gave way and the cage door swung open Tanis help us Goldmoon cried as she and Riverwind struggled to pull the injured Theros from his smoking pallet Sturm the others Tanis yelled then coughed in the smoke He staggered to the front of the wagon as the rest jumped out Sturm grabbing hold of Fizban who was still staring sadly at the door Come on Old One he yelled his gentle actions belying his harsh words as he took Fizbans arm Caramon Raistlin and Tika caught Fizban as he jumped from the flaming wreckage Tanis and Riverwind lifted Theros by the shoulders and dragged him out Goldmoon stumbled after them She and Sturm jumped from the cart just as the ceiling collapsed Caramon Get our weapons from the supply wagon Tanis shouted Go with him Sturm Flint and Tasslehoff get the packs Raistlin I willget my pack the mage said choking in the smoke And my staff No one else may touch them All right Tanis said thinking quickly Gilthanas I am not yours to order around Tanthalas the elf snapped and ran off into the woods without looking back Before Tanis could answer Sturm and Caramon ran backmCaramons knuckles were split and bleeding There had been two draconians looting the supply wagon Get moving Sturm shouted More coming Wheres your elf friend he asked Tanis suspiciously Hes gone ahead into the woods Tanis said Just remember he and his people saved us Did they Sturm said his eyes narrow It seems that between the elves and the old man we came closer to getting killed than with just about anything short of the dragon At that moment six draconians rushed out from the smoke skidding to a halt at the sight of the warriors Run for the woods Tanis yelled bending down to help Riverwind lift Theros They carried the smith to cover while Caramon and Sturm stood side by side covering their retreat Both noticed immediately that the creatures they faced were unlike the draconians they had fought before Their armor and coloring were different and they carried bows and longswords the latter dripping with some sort of awful icor Both men remembered stories about draconians that turned to acid and those whose bones exploded Caramon charged forward bellowing like an enraged animal his sword slashing in an arc Two draconians fell beforemthey knew what was attacking Sturm saluted the other four with his sword and swept off the head of one in the return stroke He jumped at the others but they stopped just out of his range grinning apparently waiting for something Sturm and Caramon watched uneasily wondering what was going on Then they knew The bodies of the slain draconians near them began to melt into the road The flesh boiled and ran like lard in a skillet A yellowish vapor formed over them mixing with the thinning smoke from the smoldering cage Both men gagged as the yellow vapor rose around them They grew dizzy and knew they were being poisoned Come on Get back Tanis yelled from the woods The two stumbled back fleeing through a rainstorm of arrows as a force of forty or fifty draconians swept around the cage screeching in anger The draconians started after them then fell back when a clear voice called out Hai Ulsain and ten elves led by Gilthanas ran from the woods Quen talas uvenelei Gilthanas shouted Caramon and Sturm staggered past him the elves covering their retreat then the elves fell back Follow me Gilthanas told the companions switching to High Common At a sign from Gilthanas four of the elven warriors picked up Theros and carried him into the woods Tanis looked back at the cage The draconians had come to a halt eyeing the woods warily Hurry Gilthanas urged My men will cover you Elven voices rose out of the woods taunting the approaching draconians trying to lure them into arrow range The companions looked at each other hesitantly I do not want to enter Elvenwood Riverwind said harshly It is all right Tanis said putting his hand on Riverwinds arm You have my pledge Riverwind stared at him for a moment then plunged into the woods the others walking by his side Last to come were Caramon and Raistlin helping Fizban The old man glanced back at the cage now nothing more than a pile of ashes and twisted iron Wonderful spell And did anyone say a word of thanks he asked wistfully The elves led them swiftly through the wilderness Without their guidance the party would have been hopelessly lost Behind them the sounds of battle turned halfhearted The draconians know better than to follow us into the woods Gilthanas said smiling grimly Tanis seeing armed elven warriors hidden among the leaves of the trees had little fear of pursuit Soon all sounds of fighting were lost A thick carpeting of dead leaves covered the ground Bare tree limbs creaked in the chill wind of early morning After spending days riding cramped in the cage the companions moved slowly and stiffly glad for the exercise that warmed their blood Gilthanas led them into a wide glade as the morning sun lit the woods with a pale light The glade was crowded with freed prisoners Tasslehoff glanced eagerly around the group then shook his head sadly I wonder what happened to Sestun he said to Tanis I thought I saw him run off Dont worry The halfelf patted him on the shoulder Hell be all right The elves have no love for gully dwarves but they wouldnt kill him Tasslehoff shook his head It wasnt the elves he was worried about Entering the clearing the companions saw an unusually tall and powerfully built elf speaking to the group of refugees His voice was cold his demeanor serious and stern You are free to go if any are free to go in this land We have heard rumors that the lands south of Pax Tharkas are not under the control of the Dragon Highlord I suggest therefore that you head southeast Move as far and as fast as you can this day We have food and supplies for your journey all that we can spare We can do little else for you The refugees from Solace stunned by their sudden freedom stared around bleakly and helplessly They had been farmers on the outskirts of Solace forced to watch while their homes burned and their crops were stolen to feed the Dragon Highlords army Most of them had never been farther from Solace than Haven Dragons and elves were creatures of legend Now childrens stories had come to haunt them Goldmoons clear blue eyes glinted She knew how they felt How can you be so cruel she called out angrily to the tall elf Look at these people They have never been out of Solace in their lives and you tell them calmly to walk through a land overrun by enemy forces What would you have me do human the elf interrupted her Lead them south myself It is enough that we have freed them My people have their own problems I cannot be concerned with those of humans He shifted his eyes to the group of refugees I warn you Time is wasting Be on your way Goldmoon turned to Tanis seeking support but he just shook his head his face dark and shadowed One of the men giving the elves a haggard glance stumbled off on the trail that meandered south through the wilderness The other men shouldered crude weapons women caught up their children and the families straggled off Goldmoon strode forward to confront the elf How can you care so little for For humans The elf stared at her coldly It was humans who brought the Cataclysm upon us They were the ones who sought the gods demanding in their pride the power that was granted Huma in humility It was humans who caused the gods to turn their faces from us They havent Goldmoon shouted The gods are among us Porthioss eyes flared with anger He started to turn away when Gilthanas stepped up to his brother and spoke to him swiftly in the elven language What do they say Riverwind asked Tanis suspiciously Gilthanas is telling how Goldmoon healed Theros Tanis said slowly It had been many many years since he had heard or spoken more than a few words in the elven tongue He had forgotten how beautiful the language was so beautiful it seemed to cut his soul and leave him wounded and bleeding inside He watched as Porthioss eyes widened in disbelief Then Gilthanas pointed at Tanis Both the brothers turned to face him their expressive elven features hardening Riverwind flicked a glance at Tanis saw the halfelf standing pale but composed under this scrutiny You return to the land of your birth do you not Riverwind asked It does not seem you are welcome Yes Tanis said grimly aware of what the Plainsman was thinking He knew Riverwind was not prying into personal affairs out of curiosity In many ways they were in more danger now than they had been with the Fewmaster They will take us to Qualinost Tanis said slowly the words apparently causing him deep pain I have not been there for many years As Flint will tell you I was not forced out but few were sorry to see me leave As you once said to me Riverwindto humans I am halfelven To elves I was halfman Then let us leave and travel south with the others Riverwind said You would never get out of here alive Flint murmured Tanis nodded Look around he said Riverwind glanced around him and saw the elven warriors moving like shadows among the trees their brown clothing blending in with the wilderness that was their home As the two elves ended their conversation Porthios turned his gaze from Tanis back to Goldmoon I have heard strange tales from my brother that bear investigation I extend to you therefore what the elves have extended to no humans in yearsour hospitality You will be our honored guests Please follow me Porthios gestured Nearly two dozen elven warriors emerged from the woods surrounding the companions Honored prisoners is more like it This is going to be rough on you my lad Flint said to Tanis in a low gentle voice I know old friend Tanis rested his hand on the dwarfs shoulder I know The Speaker of the Suns I have never imagined such beauty existed Goldmoon said softly The days march had been difficult but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled city of Qualinost Four slender spires rose from the citys corners like glistening spindles their brilliant white stone marbled with shining silver Graceful arches swooping from spire to spire soared through the air Grafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army yet they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might overthrow the balance These glistening arches were the citys only boundaries there was no wall around Qualinost The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness The buildings of Qualinost enhanced nature rather than concealing it The houses and shops were carved from rosecolored quartz Tall and slender as aspen trees they vaulted upward in impossible spirals from quartzlined avenues In the center stood a great tower of burnished gold catching the sunlight and throwing it back in whirling sparkling patterns that gave the tower life Looking down upon the city it seemed that peace and beauty unchanged from ages past must dwell in Qualinost if it dwelled anywhere in Krynn Rest here Gilthanas told them leaving them in a grove of aspen trees The journey has been long and for that I apologize I know you are weary and you hunger Caramon looked up hopefully But I must beg your indulgence a few moments longer Please excuse me Gilthanas bowed then walked to stand by his brother Sighing Caramon began rummaging through his pack for the fifth time hoping perhaps he had overlooked a morsel Raistlin read his spellbook his lips repeating the difficult words trying to grasp their meaning to find the correct inflection and phrasing that would make his blood burn and so tell him the spell was his at last The others looked around marveling at the beauty of the city beneath them and the aura of ancient tranquility that lay over it Even Riverwind seemed touched his face softened and he held Goldmoon close For a brief instant their cares and their sorrows eased and they found comfort in each others nearness Tika sat apart watching them wistfully Tasslehoff was trying to map their way from Gateway into Qualinost although Tanis had told him four times that the way was secret and the elves would never permit him to carry off a map The old magician Fizban was asleep Sturm and Flint watched Tanis in concernFlint because he alone had any idea of what the halfelf was suffering Sturm because he knew what it was like returning to a home that didnt want you The knight laid his hand on Taniss arm Coming home isnt easy my friend is it he asked No Tanis answered softly I thought I had left this behind long ago but now I know I never truly left at all Qualinesti is part of me no matter how much I want to deny it HushGilthanas Flint warned The elf came over to Tanis Runners were sent ahead and now they have returned he said in elven My father has asked to see youall of youat once in the Tower of the Sun I can not permit time for refreshment In this we seem crude and impolite Gilthanas Tanis interrupted in Common My friends and I have been through unimagined peril We have traveled roads whereliterallythe dead walked We wont faint from hungerhe glanced at Caramonsome of us wont at any rate The warrior hearing Tanis sighed and tightened his belt Thank you Gilthanas said stiffly I am glad you understand Now please follow as swiftly as you can The companions gathered their things hastily and woke Fizban Rising to his feet he fell over a tree root Big lummox he snapped striking it with his staff Theredid you see it Tried to trip me he said to Raistlin The mage slipped his precious book back into its pouch Yes Old One Raistlin smiled assisting Fizban to his feet The old magician leaned on the young ones shoulder as they walked after the others Tanis watched them wondering The old magician was obviously a dotard Yet Tanis remembered Raistlins look of stark terror when he woke and found Fizban leaning over him What had the mage seen What did he know about this old man Tanis reminded himself to ask Now however he had other more pressing matters on his mind Walking forward he caught up with the elf Tell me Gilthanas Tanis said in elven the unfamiliar words haltingly coming back to him Whats going on I have a right to know Have you Gilthanas asked harshly glancing at Tanis from the corners of his almondshaped eyes Do you care what happens to elves anymore You can barely speak our language Of course I care Tanis said angrily You are my people too Then why do you flaunt your human heritage Gilthanas gestured to Taniss bearded face I would think you would be ashamed He stopped biting his lip his face flushing Tanis nodded grimly Yes I was ashamed and thats why I left But if I was ashamedwho made me so Forgive me Tanthalas Gilthanas said shaking his head What I said was cruel and truly I did not mean it Its just that if you only understood the danger we face Tell me Tanis practically shouted in his frustration I want to understand We are leaving Qualinesti Gilthanas said Tanis stopped and stared at the elf Leaving Qualinesti he repeated switching to Common in his shock The companions heard him and cast quick glances at each other The old magicians face darkened as he tugged at his beard You cant mean it Tanis said softly Leaving Qualinesti Why Surely things arent this bad They are worse Gilthanas said sadly Look around you Tanthalas You see Qualinost in its final days They entered the first streets of the city Tanis at first glance saw everything exactly as he had left it fifty years ago Neither the streets of crushed gleaming rock nor the aspen trees they ran among had changed the clean streets sparkled brightly in the sunshine the aspens had grown perhaps perhaps not Their leaves glimmered in the late morning light the gold and silverinlaid branches rustled and sang The houses along the streets had not changed Decorated with quartz they shimmered in the sunlight creating small rainbows of color everywhere the eye looked All seemed as the elves loved itbeautiful orderly unchanging No tint was wrong Tanis realized The song of the trees was now sad and lamenting not the peaceful joyful song Tanis remembered Qualinost had changed and the change was change itself He tried to grasp hold of it to understand it even as he felt his soul shrivel with loss The change was not in the buildings not in the trees or the sun shining through the leaves The change was in the air It crackled with tension as before a storm And as Tanis walked the streets of Qualinost he saw things he had never before seen in his homeland He saw haste He saw hurry He saw indecision He saw panic desperation and despair Women meeting friends embraced and wept then parted and hurried on separate ways Children sat forlorn not understanding knowing only that play was out of place Men gathered in groups hands on their swords keeping watchful eyes on their families Here and there fires burned as the elves destroyed what they loved and could not carry with them rather than let the coming darkness consume it Tanis had grieved over the destruction of Solace but the sight of what was happening in Qualinost entered his soul like the blade of a dull knife He had not realized it meant so much to him He had known deep in his heart that even if he never returned Qualinesti would always be there But no he was losing even that Qualinesti would perish Tanis heard a strange sound and turned around to see the old magician weeping What plans have you made Where will you go Can you escape Tanis asked Gilthanas bleakly You will find out the answers to those questions and more too soon too soon Gilthanas murmured The Tower of the Sun rose high above the other buildings in Qualinost Sunlight reflecting off the golden surface gave the illusion of whirling movement The companions entered the Tower in silence awestruck by the beauty and majesty of the ancient building Only Raistlin glanced around unimpressed To his eyes there existed no beauty only death Gilthanas led the companions to a small alcove This room is just off the main chamber he said My father is meeting with the Heads of Household to plan the evacuation My brother has gone to tell him of our arrival When the business is finished we will be summoned At his gesture elves entered bearing pitchers and basins of cool water Please refresh yourselves as time permits The companions drank then washed the dust of the journey from their faces and hands Sturm removed his cloak and carefully polished his armor as best he could with one of Tasslehoffs handkerchiefs Goldmoon brushed out her shining hair kept her cloak fastened around her neck She and Tanis had decided the medallion she wore should remain hidden until the time seemed proper to reveal it some would recognize it Fizban tried without much success to straighten his bent and shapeless hat Caramon looked around for something to eat Gilthanas stood apart from them all his face pale and drawn Within moments Porthios appeared in the arched doorway You are called he said sternly The companions entered the chamber of the Speaker of the Suns No human had seen the inside of this building for hundreds of years No kender had ever seen it The last dwarves who saw it were the ones present at its construction hundreds of years before Ah now this is craftsmanship Flint said softly tears misting his eyes The chamber was round and seemed immensely larger than the slender Tower could possibly encompass Built entirely of white marble there were no support beams no columns The room soared upwards hundreds of feet to form a dome at the very top of the tower where a beautiful mosaic made of inlaid glittering tile portrayed the blue sky and the sun on one half the silver moon the red moon and the stars on the other half the halves separated by a rainbow There were no lights in the chamber Cunningly built windows and mirrors focused sunlight into the room no matter where the sun was located in the sky The streams of sunlight converged in the center of the chamber illuminating a rostrum There were no seats in the Tower The elves stoodmen and women together only those designated as Heads of Household had the right to be in this meeting There were more women present than Tanis ever remembered seeing many dressed in deep purple the color of mourning Elves marry for life and if the spouse dies do not remarry Thus the widow has the status of Head of Household until her death The companions were led to the front of the chamber The elves made room for them in respectful silence but gave them strange forbidding looksparticulary the dwarf the kender and the two barbarians who seemed grotesque in their outlandish furs There were astonished murmurs at the sight of the proud and noble Knight of Solamnia And there were scattered mutterings over the appearance of Raistlin in his red robes Elven magicusers wore the white robes of good not the red robes proclaiming neutrality That the elves believed was just one step removed from black As the crowd settled down the Speaker of the Suns came forward te the rostrum It had been many years since Tanis had seen the Speakerhis adopted father as it were And here too he saw change The man was still tall taller even than his son Porthios He was dressed in the yellow shimmering robes of his office His face was stern and unyielding his manner austere He was the Speaker of the Suns called the Speaker he had been called the Speaker for well over a century Those who knew his name never pronounced itincluding his children But Tanis saw in his hair touches of silver which had not been there before and there were lines of care and sorrow in the face which had previously seemed untouched by time Porthios joined his brother as the companions led by the elves entered The Speaker extended his arms and called them by name They walked forward into their fathers embrace My sons the Speaker said brokenly and Tanis was startled at this show of emotion I never thought to see either of you in this life again Tell me of the raid he said turning to Gilthanas In time Speaker said Gilthanas First I bid you greet our guests Yes I am sorry The Speaker passed a trembling hand over his face and it seemed to Tanis that he aged even as he stood before them Forgive me guests I bid you welcome you who have entered this kingdom no one has entered for many years Gilthanas spoke a few words and the Speaker stared shrewdly at Tanis then beckoned the halfelf forward His words were cool his manner polite if strained Is it indeed you Tanthalas son of my brothers wife The years have been long and all have wondered about your fate We welcome you back to your homeland though I fear you come only to see its final days My daughter in particular will be glad to see you She has missed her childhood playmate Gilthanas stiffened at this his face darkening as he looked at Tanis The halfelf felt his own face flush He bowed low before the Speaker unable to say a word I welcome the rest of you and hope to learn more of you later We shall not keep you long but it is right that you learn in this room what is happening in the world Then you will be allowed to rest and refresh yourselves Now my sonThe Speaker turned to Gilthanas obviously thankful to end the formalities The raid on Pax Tharkas Gilthanas stepped forward his head bowed I have failed Speaker of the Suns A murmur passed among the elves like the wind among the aspens The Speakers face bore no expression He simply sighed and stared unseeing out a tall window Tell your story he said quietly Gilthanas swallowed then spoke his voice so low many in the back of the room leaned forward to hear I traveled south with my warriors in secrecy as was planned All went well We found a group of human resistance fighters refugees from Gateway who joined us adding to our numbers Then by the crudest mischance we stumbled into the advance patrols of the dragonarmy We fought valiantly elves and humans together but for naught I was struck on the head and remember nothing more When I awoke I was lying in a ravine surrounded by the bodies of my comrades Apparently the foul dragonmen shoved the wounded over the cliff leaving us for dead Gilthanas paused clearing his throat Druids in the woods tended my injuries From them I learned that many of my warriors were still alive and had been taken prisoner Leaving the druids to bury the dead I followed the tracks of the dragonarmy and eventually came to Solace Gilthanas stopped His face glistened with sweat and his hands twitched nervously He cleared his throat again tried to speak and failed His father watched him with growing concern Gilthanas spoke Solace is destroyed There was a gasp from the audience The mighty vallenwoods have been cut and burnedfew now stand The elves wailed and cried out in dismay and anger The Speaker held up his hand for order This is grievous news he said sternly We mourn the passing of trees old even to us But continuewhat of our people I found my men tied to stakes in the center of the town square along with the humans who had helped us Gilthanas said his voice breaking They were surrounded by draconian guards I hoped to be able to free them at night Then His voice failed completely and he bowed his head as his older brother came over and laid a hand on his shoulder Gilthanas straightened A red dragon appeared in the sky Sounds of shock and dismay came from the assembled elves The Speaker shook his head in sorrow Yes Speaker Gilthanas said and his voice was loud unnaturally loud and jarring It is true These monsters have returned to Krynn The red dragon circled above Solace and all who saw him fled in terror He flew lower and lower and then landed in the town square His great gleaming red reptile body filled the clearing his wings spread destruction his tail toppled trees Yellow fangs glistened green saliva dripped from his massive jaws his huge talons tore the ground and riding upon his back was a human male Powerfully built he was dressed in the black robes of a cleric of the Queen of Darkness A black and gold cape fluttered around him His face was hidden by a hideous horned mask fashioned in black and gold to resemble the face of a dragon The dragonmen fell to their knees in worship as the dragon landed The goblins and hobgoblins and foul humans who fight with the dragonmen cowered in terror many ran away Only the example of my people gave me the courage to stay Now that he was speaking Gilthanas seemed eager to tell the story Some of the humans tied to stakes went into a frenzy of terror screaming piteously But my warriors remained calm and defiant although all were affected alike by the dragonfear the monster generates The dragonrider did not seem to find this pleasing He glared at them and then spoke in a voice that came from the depths of the Abyss His words still burn in my mind I am Verminaard Dragon Highlord of the North I have fought to free this land and these people from the false beliefs spread by those who call themselves Seekers Many have come to work for me pleased to further the great cause of the Dragon Highlords I have shown them mercy and graced them with the blessings my goddess has granted me Spells of healing I possess as do no others in this land and therefore you know that I am the representative of the true gods But you humans who stand before me now have defied me You chose to fight me and therefore your punishment will serve as an example to any others who choose folly over wisdom Then he turned to the elves and said Be it known by this act that I Verminaard will destroy your race utterly as decreed by my goddess Humans can be taught to see the errors of their ways but elvesnever The mans voice rose until it raged louder than the winds Let this be your final warningall who watch Ember destroy And with that the great dragon breathed out fire upon all those tied to the stakes They writhed helplessly burning to death in terrible agony There was no sound at all in the chamber The shock and horror were too great for words A madness swept over me Gilthanas continued his eyes burning feverishly almost a reflection of what he had seen I started to rush forward to die with my people when a great hand grasped me and dragged me backwards It was Theros Ironfeld the blacksmith of Solace Now is not the time to die elf he told me Now is the time for revenge I I collapsed then and he took me back to his house in peril of his own life And he would have paid for his kindness to elves with his life had not this woman healed him Gilthanas pointed to Goldmoon who stood at the back of the group her face shrouded by her fur cape The Speaker turned to stare at her as did the other elves in the chamber their murmurings dark and ominous Theros is the man brought here today Speaker Porthios said The man with but one arm Our healers say he will live But they say it is only by a miracle that his life was spared so dreadful were his wounds Come forward woman of the Plains the Speaker commanded sternly Goldmoon took a step toward the rostrum Riverwind at her side Two elven guards moved swiftly to block him He glared at them but stood where he was The Chieftains Daughter moved forward holding her head proudly As she removed her hood the sun shone on the silvergold hair cascading down her back The elves marveled at her beauty You claim to have healed this manTheros Ironfeld The Speaker asked her with disdain I claim nothing Goldmoon answered coolly Your son saw me heal him Do you doubt his words No but he was overwrought sick and confused He may have mistaken witchcraft for healing Look on this Goldmoon said gently and untied her cape letting it fall away from her neck The medallion sparkled in the sunlight The Speaker left the rostrum and came forward his eyes widening in disbelief Then his face became distorted with rage Blasphemy he shouted Reaching out he started to rip the medallion from Goldmoons throat There was a flash of blue light The Speaker crumbled to the floor with a cry of pain As the elves shouted out in alarm drawing their swords the companions drew theirs Elven warriors rushed to surround them Stop this nonsense said the old magician in a strong stern voice Fizban tottered up to the rostrum calmly pushing aside the sword blades as if they were slender branches of an aspen tree The elves stared in astonishment seemingly unable to stop him Muttering to himself Fizban came up to the Speaker who was lying stunned on the floor The old man helped the elf to his feet Now then you asked for that you know Fizban scolded brushing the Speakers robes as the elf gaped at him Who are you the Speaker gasped Mmmm What was that name The old magician glanced around at Tasslehoff Fizban the kender said helpfully Yes Fizban Thats who I am The magician stroked his white beard Now Solostaran I suggest you call off your guards and tell everyone to settle down I for one would like to hear the story of this young womans adventures and you for one would do well to listen It wouldnt hurt you to apologize either As Fizban shook his finger at the Speaker his battered hat tilted forward covering his eyes Help Ive gone blind Raistlin with a distrustful glance at the elven guards hurried forward He took the old mans arm and straightened his hat Ah thank the true gods the magician said blinking and shuffling across the floor The Speaker watched the old magician a puzzled expression on his face Then as if in a dream he turned to face Goldmoon I do apologize lady of the Plains he said softly It has been over three hundred years since the elven clerics vanished three hundred years since the symbol of Mishakal was seen in this land My heart bled to see the amulet profaned as I thought Forgive me We have been in despair so long I failed to see the arrival of hope Please if you are not weary tell us your story Goldmoon related the story of the medallion telling of Riverwind and the stoning the meeting of the companions at the Inn and their journey to Xak Tsaroth She told of the destruction of the dragon and of how she received the medallion of Mishakal But she didnt mention the Disks The suns rays lengthened as she spoke changing color as twilight approached When her story ended the Speaker was silent for long moments I must consider all of this and what it means to us he said finally He turned to the companions You are exhausted I see some of you stand by courage alone Indeedhe smiled looking at Fizban who leaned against a pillar snoring softly some of you are asleep on your feet My daughter Laurana will guide you to a place where you can forget your fears We will hold a banquet in your honor tonight for you bring us hope May the peace of the true gods go with you The elves parted and out of their midst came an elfmaiden who walked forward to stand beside the Speaker At sight of her Caramons mouth sagged open Riverwinds eyes widened Even Raistlin stared his eyes seeing beauty at last for no hint of decay touched the young elfmaiden Her hair was honey pouring from a pitcher it spilled over her arms and down her back past her waist touching her wrists as she stood with her arms at her sides Her skin was smooth and woodland brown She had the delicate refined features of the elves but these were combined with full pouting lips and large liquid eyes that changed color like leaves in flickering sunshine On my honor as a knight Sturm said with a catch in his voice Ive never seen any woman so lovely Nor will you in this world Tanis murmured All the companions glanced at Tanis sharply as he spoke but the halfelf did not notice His eyes were on the elfmaid Sturm raised his eyebrows exchanged looks with Caramon who nudged his brother Flint shook his head and sighed a sigh that seemed to come from his toes Now much is made clear Goldmoon said to Riverwind It hasnt been made clear to me Tasslehoff said Do you know whats going on Tika All Tika knew was that looking at Laurana she felt suddenly dumpy and halfdressed freckled and redheaded She tugged her blouse up higher over her full bosom wishing it didnt reveal quite so much or that she had less to reveal Tell me whats going on Tasslehoff whispered seeing the knowing looks exchanged by the others I dont know Tika snapped Just that Caramons making a fool of himself Look at the big ox Youd think hed never seen a woman before She is pretty Tas said Different from you Tika Shes slender and she walks like a tree bending in the wind and Oh shut up Tika snapped furiously giving Tas a shove that nearly knocked him down Tasslehoff gave her a wounded glance then walked over to stand beside Tanis determined to keep near the halfelf until he figured out what was going on I welcome you to Qualinost honored guests Laurana said shyly in a voice that was like a clear stream rippling among the trees Please follow me The way is not far and there is food and drink and rest at the end Moving with childlike grace she walked among the companions who parted for her as the elves had done all of them staring at her admiringly Laurana lowered her eyes in maidenly modesty and selfconsciousness her cheeks flushing She looked up only once and that was as she passed Tanisa fleeting glance that only Tanis saw His face grew troubled his eyes darkened The companions left the Tower of the Sun waking Fizban as they departed Tanis and Laurana Laurana led them to a sundappled grove of aspens in the very center of the city Here though surrounded by buildings and streets they seemed to be in the heart of a forest Only the murmurings of a nearby brook broke the stillness Laurana gesturing toward fruit trees among the aspens told the companions to pick and eat their fill Elfmaids brought in baskets of fresh fragrant bread The companions washed in the brook then returned to relax on soft moss beds to revel in the silent peacefulness around them All except Tanis Refusing food the halfelf wandered around the grove absorbed in his own thoughts Tasslehoff watched him closely eaten alive by curiosity Laurana was a perfect charming hostess She made certain everyone was seated and comfortable speaking a few words to each of them Flint Fireforge isnt it she said The dwarf flushed with pleasure I still have some of the wonderful toys you made me We have missed you these many years So flustered he couldnt talk Flint plopped down on the grass and gulped down a huge mug of water You are Tika Laurana asked stopping by the barmaid Tika Waylan the girl said huskily Tika what a pretty name And what beautiful hair you have Laurana said reaching out to touch the bouncy red curls admiringly Do you think so Tika said blushing seeing Caramons eyes on her Of course It is the color of flame You must have a spirit to match I heard how you saved my brothers life in the Inn Tika I am deeply indebted to you Thank you Tika answered softly Your hair is real pretty too Laurana smiled and moved on Tasslehoff noticed however that her eyes constantly strayed to Tanis When the halfelf suddenly threw down an apple and disappeared into the trees Laurana excused herself hurriedly and followed Ah now Ill find out whats going on Tas said to himself Glancing around he slipped after Tanis Tas crept along the winding trail among the trees and suddenly came upon the halfelf standing beside the foaming stream alone tossing dead leaves into the water Seeing movement to his left Tas quickly crouched down into a clump of bushes as Laurana emerged from another trail Tanthalas Quisif nanPahf she called As Tanis turned at the sound of his elven name she flung her arms around his neck kissing him Ugh she said teasingly pulling back Shave off that horrible beard It itches And you dont look like Tanthalas anymore Tanis put his hands to her waist and gently pushed her away Laurana he began No dont be mad about the beard Ill learn to like it if you insist Laurana pleaded pouting Kiss me back No Then Ill kiss you until you cannot help yourself She kissed him again until finally Tanis broke free of her grip Stop it Laurana he said harshly turning away Why whats the matter she asked catching hold of his hand Youve been gone so many years And now youre back Dont be cold and gloomy You are my betrothed remember It is proper for a girl to kiss her betrothed That was a long time ago Tanis said We were children then playing a game nothing more It was romantic a secret to share You know what would have happened if your father had found out Gilthanas did find out didnt he Of course I told him Laurana said hanging her head looking up at Tanis through her long eyelashes I tell Gilthanas everything you know that I didnt think hed react like that I know what he said to you He told me later He felt badly Ill bet he did Tanis gripped her wrists holding her hands still What he said was true Laurana I am a bastard halfbreed Your father would have every right to kill me How could I bring disgrace down on him after what he did for my mother and me That was one reason I leftthat and to find out who I am and where I belong You are Tanthalas my beloved and you belong here Laurana cried She broke free of his grip and caught his hands in her own Look You wear my ring still I know why you left It was because you were afraid to love me but you dont need to be not anymore Everythings changed Father has so much to worry about he wont mind Besides youre a hero now Please let us be married Isnt that why you came back Laurana Tanis spoke gently but firmly my returning was an accident No she cried pushing him away I dont believe you You must have heard Gilthanass story If Porthios had not rescued us we would have been in Pax Tharkas now He made it up He didnt want to tell me the truth You came back because you love me I wont listen to anything else I didnt want to tell you but I see that I must Tanis said exasperated Laurana Im in love with someone elsea human woman Her name is Kitiara That doesnt mean I dont love you too I do Tanis faltered Laurana stared at him all color drained from her face I do love you Laurana But you see I cant marry you because I love her too My heart is divided just like my blood He took off the ring of golden ivy leaves and handed it to her I release you from any promises you made to me Laurana And I ask you to release me Laurana took the ring unable to speak She looked at Tanis pleadingly then seeing only pity in his face shrieked and flung the ring away from her It fell at Tass feet He picked it up and slipped it into a pouch Laurana Tanis said sorrowfully taking her in his arms as she sobbed wildly Im so sorry I never meant At this point Tasslehoff slipped out of the brush and made his way back up the trail Well said the kender to himself sighing in satisfaction now at least I know whats going on Tanis awoke suddenly to find Gilthanas standing over him Laurana he asked getting to his feet She is all right Gilthanas said quietly Her maidens brought her home She told me what you said I just want you to know I understand It was what I feared all along The human half of you cries to other humans I tried to tell her hoping she wouldnt get hurt She will listen to me now Thank you Tanthalas I know it cannot have been easy It wasnt Tanis said swallowing Im going to be honest GilthanasI love her I really do Its just that Please say no more Let us leave it as it is and perhaps if we cannot be friends we can at least respect each other Gilthanass face was drawn and pale in the setting sun You and your friends must prepare yourselves When the silver moon rises there will be a feast and then the High Council meeting Now is the time when decisions must be made He left Tanis stared after him a moment then sighing went to wake the others Farewell The companions decision The feast held in Qualinost reminded Goldmoon of her mothers funeral banquet Like the feast the funeral was supposed to be a joyous occasionafter all Tearsong had become a goddess But the people found it difficult to accept the death of this beautiful woman And so the Queshu mourned her passing with a grief that approached blasphemy Tearsongs funeral banquet was the most elaborate to be given in the memory of the Queshu Her grieving husband had spared no expense Like the banquet in Qualinost on this night there was a great deal of food which few could eat There were halfhearted attempts at conversation when no one wanted to talk Occasionally someone overcome with sorrow was forced to leave the table So vivid was this memory that Goldmoon could eat little the food was ash in her mouth Riverwind regarded her with concern His hand found hers beneath the table and she gripped it hard smiling as his strength flowed into her body The elven feast was held in the courtyard just south of the great golden tower There were no walls about the platform of crystal and marble which sat atop the highest hill in Qualinost offering an unobstructed view of the glittering city below the dark forest beyond and even the deep purple edge of the Tharkadan Mountains far to the south But the beauty was lost on those in attendance or made more poignant by the knowledge that soon it would be gone forever Goldmoon sat at the right hand of the Speaker He tried to make polite conversation but eventually his worries and concerns overwhelmed him and he fell silent To the Speakers left sat his daughter Laurana She made no pretense at eating just sat with her head bowed her long hair flowing around her face When she did look up it was to gaze at Tanis her heart in her eyes The halfelf very much aware of the heartbroken stare as well as of Gilthanas eyeing him coldly ate his food without appetite his eyes fixed on his plate Sturm next to him was drawing up in his mind plans for the defence of Qualinesti Flint felt strange and out of place as dwarves always feel among elves He didnt like elven food anyway and refused everything Raistlin nibbled at his food absently his golden eyes studying Fizban Tika feeling awkward and out of place among the graceful elven women couldnt eat a morsel Caramon decided he knew why elves were so slender the food consisted of fruit and vegetables cooked in delicate sauces served with bread and cheeses and a very light spicy wine After starving for four days in the cage the food did nothing to satisfy the big warriors hunger The only two in the entire city of Qualinost to enjoy the feast were Tasslehoff and Fizban The old magician carried on a one sided argument with an aspen while Tasslehoff simply enjoyed everything discovering laterto his surprisethat two golden spoons a silver knife and a butter dish made of a seashell had wandered into one of his pouches The red moon was not visible Luniatari a slim band of silver in the sky began to wane As the first stars appeared the Speaker of the Suns nodded sadly at his son Gilthanas rose and moved to stand next to his fathers chair Gilthanas began to sing The elven words flowed into a melody delicate and beautiful As he sang Gilthanas held a small crystal lamp in both hands the candlelight within illuminating his marble features Tanis listening to the song closed his eyes his head sank into his hands What is it What do the words mean Sturm asked softly Tanis raised his head His voice breaking he whispered Now Sleep Our oldest friend Lulls in the trees And calls Us in The Leaves Give off cold fire They blaze into ash At the end of the year And birds Coast on the winds And wheel to the North When Autumn ends The day grows dark The seasons bare But we Await the suns Green fire upon The trees Points of flickering lantern light spread from the courtyard like ripples in a still calm pond through the streets into the forests and beyond And with each lamp lit another voice was raised in song until the surrounding forest itself seemed to sing with despair The wind Dives through the days By season by moon Great kingdoms arise The breath Of firefly of bird Of trees of mankind Fades ina word Now Sleep Our oldest friend Lulls in the trees And calls Us in The Age The thousand lives Of men and their stories Go to their graves But We The people long In poem and glory Fade from the song Gilthanass voice died away With a gentle breath he blew out the flame of his lamp One by one as they had started the others around the table ended the song and blew out their candles All through Qualinost the voices hushed and the flames were extinguished until it seemed that silence and darkness swept over the land At the very end only the distant mountains returned the final chords of the song like the whispering of leaves falling to the ground The Speaker stood And now he said heavily it is time for the meeting of the High Council It will be held in the Hall of the Sky Tanthalas if you will lead your companions there The Hall of the Sky they discovered was a huge square lit by torches The giant dome of the heavens glittering with stars arched above it But it was dark to the north where lightning played on the horizon The Speaker motioned to Tanis to bring the companions to stand near him then the entire population of Qualinost gathered around them There was no need to call for silence Even the wind hushed as the Speaker began Here you see our situation He gestured at something on the ground The companions saw a gigantic map beneath their feet Tasslehoff standing in the middle of the Plains of Abanasinia drew in a deep breath He couldnt remember ever seeing anything so wonderful Theres Solace he cried in excitement pointing Yes Kenderkin the Speaker replied And that is where the dragonarmies mass In Solacehe touched the spot on the map with a staffand in Haven Lord Verminaard has made no secret of his plans to invade Qualinesti He waits only to gather his forces and secure his supply routes We cannot hope to stand against such a horde Surely Qualinost is easily defended Sturm spoke up There is no direct route overland We crossed bridges over ravines that no army in existence could get through if the bridges were cut Why do you not stand up to them If it were only an army we could defend Qualinesti the Speaker answered But what can we do against dragons The Speaker spread his hands helplessly Nothing According to legends it was only with the Dragonlance that the mighty Huma defeated them There are none nowat least that we know ofwho remember the secret of that great weapon Fizban started to speak but Raistlin hushed him No the Speaker continued we must abandon this city and these woods We plan to go west into the unknown lands there hoping to find a new home for our peopleor perhaps even return to Silvanesti the most ancient elvenhome Until a week ago our plans were advancing well It will take three days of forced marching for the Dragon Highlord to move his men into attack position and spies will inform us when the army leaves Solace We will have time to escape into the west But then we learned of a third dragonarmy at Pax Tharkas less than a days journey from us Unless that army is stopped we are doomed And you know a way to stop that army Tanis asked Yes The Speaker looked at his youngest son As you know men from Gateway and Solace and surrounding communities are being held prisoner in the fortress of Pax Tharkas working as slaves for the Dragon Highlord Verminaard is clever Lest his slaves revolt he keeps the women and children of these men hostages ransom for the mens behavior It is our belief that were these captives freed the men would turn on their masters and destroy them It was to have been Gilthanass mission to free the hostages and lead the revolt He would have taken the humans south into the mountains drawing off this third army in pursuit allowing us time to escape And what of the humans then Riverwind asked harshly It seems to me you throw them to the dragonarmies as a desperate man throws hunks of meat to pursuing wolves Lord Verminaard will not keep them alive much longer we fear The ore is nearly gone He is gleaning every last little bit then the slaves usefulness to him will end There are valleys in the mountains caves where the humans can live and fend off the dragonarmies They can easily hold the mountain passes against them especially now that winter is setting in Admittedly some may die but that is a price that must be paid If you had the choice man of the Plains would you rather die in slavery or die fighting Riverwind not answering stared down at the map darkly Gilthanass mission failed Tanis said and now you want us to try and lead the revolt Yes Tanthalas the Speaker replied Gilthanas knows a way into Pax Tharkasthe SlaMori He can lead you into the fortress You not only have a chance to free your own kind but you offer the elves a chance to escapethe Speakers voice hardeneda chance to live that many elves were not given when humans brought the Cataclysm down upon us Riverwind glanced up scowling Even Sturms expression darkened The Speaker drew a deep breath then sighed Please forgive me he said I do not mean to flog you wit whips from the past We are not uncaring about the humans plight I send my son Gilthanas with you willingly knowing thatif we partwe may never see each other again I make this sacrifice so that my peopleand yoursmay live We must have time to consider Tanis said though he knew what his decision must be The Speaker nodded and elven warriors cleared a path through the crowd leading the companions to a grove of trees Here they left them alone Taniss friends stood before him their solemn faces masks of light and shadow beneath the stars All this time he thought I have fought to keep us together Now I see that we must separate We cannot risk taking the Disks into Pax Tharkas and Goldmoon will not leave them behind I will go to Pax Tharkas Tanis said softly But I believe it is time now that we separate my friends Before you speak let me say this I would send Tika Goldmoon Riverwind Caramon and Raistlin and you Fizban with the elves in hopes that you may carry the Disks to safety The Disks are too precious to risk on a raid into Pax Tharkas That may be HalfElf Raistlin whispered from the depths of his cowl but it is not among the Qualinesti elves that Goldmoon will find the one she seeks How do you know Tanis asked startled He doesnt know anything Tanis Sturm interrupted bitterly More talk Raistlin Tanis repeated ignoring Sturm You heard the knight the mage hissed I know nothing Tanis sighed letting it go and glanced around You named me your leader Aye we did lad said Flint suddenly But this decision is coming from your headnot your heart Deep inside you dont really believe we should split up Well Im not staying with these elves Tika said folding her arms across her chest Im going with you Tanis I plan to become a swordswoman like Kitiara Tanis winced Hearing Kitiaras name was like a physical blow I will not hide with elves Riverwind said especially if it means leaving my kind behind to fight for me He and I are one Goldmoon said putting her hand on his arm Besides she said more softly somehow I know that what the mage says is truethe leader is not among the elves They want to flee the world not fight for it Were all going Tanis Flint said firmly The halfelf looked helplessly around at the group then he smiled and shook his head Youre right I didnt truly believe we should separate Its the sensible logical thing to do of course which is why we wont do it Now maybe we can get some sleep Fizban yawned Wait a minute Old One Tanis said sternly You are not one of us Youre definitely going with the elves Am I the old mage asked softly as his eyes lost their vague unfocused look He stared at Tanis with such a penetratingalmost menacinggaze that the halfelf involuntarily took a step back suddenly sensing an almost palpable aura of power surrounding the old man His voice was soft and intense I go where I choose in this world and I choose to go with you Tanis HalfElven Raistlin glanced at Tanis as if to say Now you understand Tanis irresolute returned the glance He regretted putting off discussing this with Raistlin but wondered how they could confer now knowing the old man would not leave I speak you this Raistlin Tanis said suddenly using Camptalk a corrupted form of Common developed among the racially mixed mercenaries of Krynn The twins had done a bit of mercenary work in their timeas had most of the companionsin order to eat Tanis knew Raistlin would understand He was fairly certain the old man wouldnt We talk if want Raistlin answered in the same language but little know I You fear Why Raistlins strange eyes stared far away as he answered slowly I know not Tanis Butyou right There power be within Old One I feel great power I fear His eyes gleamed And I hunger The mage sighed and seemed to return from wherever it was he had been But he right Try to stop him Very much danger As if there wasnt enough already Tanis said bitterly switching back to Common We take our own in with us in the form of a doddering old magician Others there are as dangerous perhaps Raistlin said with a meaningful look at his brother The mage returned to Common I am weary I must sleep Are you staying brother Yes Caramon answered exchanging glances with Sturm Were going to talk with Tanis Raistlin nodded and gave his arm to Fizban The old mage and the young one left the old mage lashing out at a tree with his staff accusing it of trying to sneak up on him As if one crazed mage wasnt bad enough Flint muttered Im going to bed One by one the others left until Tanis stood with Caramon and Sturm Wearily Tanis turned to face them He had a feeling he knew what this was going to be about Caramons face was flushed and he stared at his feet Sturm stroked his moustaches and regarded Tanis thoughtfully Well Tanis asked Gilthanas Sturm answered Tanis frowned and scratched his beard Thats my business not yours he said shortly It is our business Tanis Sturm persisted if hes leading us into Pax Tharkas We dont want to pry but its obvious theres a score to settle between you two Ive seen his eyes when he looks at you Tanis and if I were you I wouldnt go anywhere without a friend at my back Caramon looked at Tanis earnestly his brow furrowed I know hes an elf and all the big man said slowly But like Sturm says he gets a funny look in his eyes sometimes Dont you know the way to this SlaMori Cant we find it ourselves I dont trust him Neither do Sturm or Raist Listen Tanis Sturm said seeing the halfelfs face darken with anger If Gilthanas was in such danger in Solace as he claimed why was he casually sitting in the Inn And then theres this story about his warriors accidentally running into a whole damn army Tanisdont shake your head so quickly He may not be evil just misguided What if Verminaards got some hold over him Perhaps the Dragon Highlord convinced him hed spare his people ifin returnhe betrays us Maybe thats why he was in Solace waiting for us Thats ridiculous Tanis snapped How would he know we were coming We didnt exactly keep our journey from Xak Tsaroth to Solace secret Sturm returned coldly We saw draconians all along the way and those that escaped Xak Tsaroth must have realized we came for the Disks Verminaard probably knows our descriptions better than he knows his own mother No I dont believe it Tanis said angrily glaring at Sturm and Caramon You two are wrong Ill stake my life onit I grew up with Gilthanas I know him Yes there is a score to settle between us but we have discussed it and the matter is closed Ill believe hes turned traitor to his people the day I believe you or Caramon turn traitor And no I dont know the way to Pax Tharkas Ive never been there And one more thing Tanis shouted now in a fury if theres people I dont trust in this group its that brother of yours and that old man He stared accusingly at Caramon The big man grew pale and lowered his eyes He began to turn away Tanis came to his senses suddenly realizing what he had said Im sorry Caramon He put his hand on the warriors arm I didnt mean that Raistlins saved our lives more than once on this insane journey Its just that I cant believe Gilthanas is a traitor We know Tanis Sturm said quietly And we trust your judgment Butits too dark a night to walk with your eyes closed as my people say Tanis sighed and nodded He put his other hand on Sturms arm The knight clasped him and the three men stood in silence then they left the grove and walked back to the Hall of the Sky They could still hear the Speaker talking with his warriors What does SlaMori mean Caramon asked Secret Way Tanis answered Tanis woke with a start his hand on the dagger at his belt A dark shape crouched over him in the night blotting out the stars overhead Reaching up quickly he grabbed hold of and yanked the person down across his body putting his dagger to the exposed throat Tanthalas There was a small scream at the sight of the steel flashing in the starlight Laurana Tanis gasped Her body pressed against his He could feel her trembling and now that he was fully awake he could see the long hair flowing loosely about her shoulders She was dressed only in a flimsy nightdress Her cloak had fallen off in the brief struggle Acting on impulse Laurana had risen from her bed and slipped out into the night throwing a cloak around her to protect her from the cold Now she lay across Taniss chest too frightened to move This was a side of Tanis she had never known existed She realized suddenly that if she had been an enemy she would be dead nowher throat slit Laurana Tanis repeated thrusting the dagger back into his belt with a shaking hand He pushed her away and sat up angry at himself for frightening her and angry at her for awakenmg something deep within him For an instant when she lay on top of him he was acutely conscious only of the smell of her hair the warmth of her slender body the play of the muscles in her thighs the softness of her small breasts Laurana had been a girl when he left He returned to find a womana very beautiful desirable woman What in the name of the Abyss are you doing here at this time of night Tanthalas she said choking pulling her cape around her tightly I came to ask you to change your mind Let your friends go to free the humans in Pax Tharkas You must come with us Dont throw your life away My father is desperate He doesnt believe this will workI know he doesnt But he hasnt any choice Hes already mourning Gilthanas as if he were dead Im going to lose my brother I cant lose you too She began to sob Tanis glanced around hastily There were almost certainly elven guards around If the elves caught him in this compromising situation Laurana he said gripping her shoulders and shaking her Youre not a child anymore Youve got to grow up and grow up fast I wouldnt let my friends face danger without me I know the risks were taking Im not blind But if we can free the humans from Verminaard and give you and your people time to escape its a chance we have to take There comes a time Laurana when youve got to risk your life for something you believe insomething that means more than life itself Do you understand She looked up at him through a mass of golden hair Her sobs stopped and she ceased to tremble She stared at him very intently Do you understand Laurana he repeated Yes Tanthalas she answered softly I understand Good He sighed Now go back to bed Quickly Youve put me in danger If Gilthanas saw us like this Laurana stood up and walked swiftly from the grove flitting along the streets and buildings like the wind among the aspens Sneaking past the guards to get back inside her fathers dwelling was simpleshe and Gilthanas had been doing it since childhood Returning quietly to her room she stood outside her fathers and mothers door for a moment listening There was light inside She could hear parchment rustling smell an acrid odor Her father was burning papers She heard her mothers soft murmur calling her father to bed Laurana closed her eyes for a moment in silent agony then her lips tightened in firm resolve and she ran down the dark chill hallway to her bedchamber Doubts Ambush A new friend The elves woke the companions before dawn Storm clouds lowered on the northern horizon reaching like grasping fingers toward Qualinesti Gilthanas arrived after breakfast dressed in a tunic of blue cloth and suit of chain mail We have supplies he said gesturing toward the warriors who held packs in their hands We can also provide weapons or armament if you have need Tika needs armor and shield and sword said Caramon We will provide what we can Gilthanas said though I doubt if we have a full set of armor small enough How is Theros Ironfeld this morning Goldmoon asked He rests comfortably cleric of Mishakal Gilthanas bowed respectfully to Goldmoon My people will of course take him with them when we leave You may bid him farewell Elves soon returned with armor of every make and description for Tika and a lightweight shortsword favored by the elven women Tikas eyes glowed when she saw the helm and shield Both were of elvish design tooled and decorated with jewels Gilthanas took the helm and shield from the elf I have yet to thank you for saving my life in the Inn he said to Tika Accept these They are my mothers ceremonial armor dating back to the time of the Kinslayer wars These would have gone to my sister but Laurana and I both believe you are the proper owner How beautiful Tika murmured blushing She accepted the helm then looked at the rest of the armor in confusion I dont know what goes where she confessed Ill help Caramon offered eagerly Ill handle this Goldmoon said firmly Picking up the armor she led Tika into a grove of trees What does she know about armor Caramon grumbled Riverwind looked at the warrior and smiled the rare infrequent smile that softened his stem face You forget he said she is Chieftains Daughter It was her duty in her father absence to lead the tribe to war She knows a great deal about armor warriorand even more about the heart that beats beneath it Caramon flushed Nervously he picked up a pack of supplies and glanced inside Whats this junk he asked Quithpa said Gilthanas Iron rations in your language It will last us for many weeks if need be It looks like dried fruit Caramon said in disgust Thats what it is Tanis replied grinning Caramon groaned Dawn was just beginning to tinge the wispy storm clouds with a pale chill light when Gilthanas led the party out of Qualinesti Tanis kept his eyes straight ahead refusing to look back He wished that his final trip here could have been happier He had not seen Laurana all morning and though he felt relieved to have avoided a tearful farewell he secretly wondered why she hadnt come to bid him goodbye The trail moved south descending gradually but constantly It had been thick and overgrown with brush but the party of warriors Gilthanas led before had cleared it as they moved so that walking was relatively easy Caramon walked beside Tika resplendent in her mismatched armor instructing her on the use of her sword Unfortunately the teacher was having a bad time of it Goldmoon had slit Tikas red barmaid skirt up to her thighs for easier movement Bits of fluffy white from Tikas furtrimmed undergarments peeped enticingly through the slits Her legs were visible as she walked and the girls legs were just as Caramon had always imaginedround and wellformed Thus Caramon found it rather difficult to concentrate on his lesson Absorbed in his pupil he did not notice that his brother had disappeared Wheres the young mage Gilthanas asked harshly Maybe somethings happened to him Caramon said worriedly cursing himself for forgetting his brother The warrior drew his sword and started back along the trail Nonsense Gilthanas stopped him What could have happened to him There is no enemy for miles He must have gone off somewherefor some purpose What are you saying Caramon asked glowering Maybe he left to To collect what I need for the making of my magic elf Raistlin whispered emerging from the brush And to replenish the herbs that heal my cough Raist Caramon nearly hugged him in his relief You shouldnt go off by yourselfits dangerous My spell components are secret Raistlin whispered irritably shoving his brother away Leaning on the Staff of Magius the mage rejoined Fizban in the line Gilthanas cast a sharp glance at Tanis who shrugged and shook his head As the group continued on the trail became steeper and steeper leading down from the aspenwoods to the pines of the lowlands It joined up with a clear brook that soon became a raging stream as they traveled farther south When they stopped for a hasty lunch Fizban came over and hunkered down beside Tanis Someones following us he said in a penetrating whisper What Tanis asked his head snapping up to stare at the old man incredulously Yes indeed the old mage nodded solemnly Ive seen it darting in and out among the trees Sturm saw Taniss look of concern Whats the matter The Old One says someones following us Bah Gilthanas threw down his last bit of quithpa in disgust and stood up Thats insane Let us go now The SlaMori is still many miles and we must be there by sundown Ill take rear guard Sturm said to Tanis softly They walked through the ragged pines for several more hours The sun slanted down in the sky lengthening shadows across the trail when the group came suddenly to a clearing Hsst Tanis warned falling back in alarm Caramon instantly alert drew his sword motioning for Sturm and his brother with his free hand What is it piped Tasslehoff I cant see Shhh Tanis glared at the kender and Tas clapped his own hand over his own mouth to save Tanis the trouble The clearing was the site of a recent bloody fight Bodies of men and hobgoblins lay scattered about in the obscene postures of brutal death The companions looked about fearfully and listened for long minutes but could hear nothing above the roar of the water No enemy for miles Sturm glared at Gilthanas and started to step out into the clearing Wait Tanis said I thought I saw something move Maybe one of thems still alive Sturm said coolly and walked forward The rest followed more slowly A low moaning sound came from beneath two hobgoblin bodies The warriors walked toward the carnage swords level Caramon Tanis gestured The big warrior shoved the bodies to one side Beneath was a moaning figure Human Caramon reported And covered with blood Unconscious I think The rest came up to look at the man on the ground Goldmoon started to kneel down but Caramon stopped her No lady he said gently It would be senseless to heal him if we just have to kill him again Rememberhumans fought for the Dragon Highlord in Solace The group gathered round to examine the man He wore chain mail that was of good quality if rather tarnished His clothes were rich though the cloth had worn thin in places He appeared to be in his late thirties His hair was thick and black his chin firm and his features regular The stranger opened his eyes and stared up at the companions blearily Thank the gods of the Seekers he said hoarsely My friendsare they all dead Worry about yourself first Sturm said sternly Tell us who your friends werethe humans or the hobgoblins The humansfighters against the dragonmen The man broke off his eyes widening Gilthanas Eben Gilthanas said in quiet surprise How did you survive the battle at the ravine How did you for that matter The man named Eben tried to stagger to his feet Caramon reached out a hand to help him when suddenly Eben pointed Look out Drac Caramon whipped around letting Eben fall back with a groan The others turnedto see twelve draconians standing at the edge of the clearing weapons drawn All strangers in the land are to be taken to the Dragon Highlord for questioning one called out We charge you to come with us peacefully No one was supposed to know about this path to SlaMori Sturm whispered to Tanis with a meaningful glance at Gilthanas According to the elf that is We do not take orders from Lord Verminaard Tanis yelled ignoring Sturm You will soon enough the draconian said and waved its arm The creatures surged forward to attack Fizban standing near the edge of the woods pulled something from his pouch and began to mumble a few words Not Fireball Raistlin hissed grabbing the old mages arm Youll incinerate everyone out there Oh really I suppose youre right The old mage sighed in disappointment then brightened WaitIll think of something else Just stay here under cover Raistlin ordered Im going to my brother Now what was that web spell The old man pondered Tika her new sword drawn and ready trembled with fear and excitement One draconian rushed her and she swung a tremendous blow The blade missed the draconian by a mile Caramons head by inches Pulling Tika behind him he knocked the draconian down with the flat of his sword Before it could rise he stepped on its throat breaking its neck Get behind me he said to Tika then glanced down at the sword she was still waving around wildly On second thought Caramon amended nervously run over to those trees with the old man and Goldmoon Theres a good girl I will not Tika said indignantly Ill show him she muttered her sweaty palms slipping on the hilt of the sword Two more draconians charged Caramon but his brother was beside him nowthe two combining magic and steel to destroy their enemy Tika knew she would only get in their way and she feared Raistlins anger more than she feared draconians She looked around to see if anyone needed her help Sturm and Tanis fought side by side Gilthanas made an unlikely team with Flint while Tasslehoffhis hoopak planted solidly in the groundsent a deadly barrage of rocks whizzing onto the field Goldmoon stood beneath the trees Riverwind near her The old magician had pulled out a spellbook and was flipping through its pages Web web how did that go he mumbled Aaarrrgghh A screech behind Tika nearly caused her to swallow her tongue Whirling around she dropped her sword in alarm as a draconian laughing horribly launched itself into the air straight at her Panicstricken Tika gripped her shield in both hands and struck the draconian in its hideous reptilian face The impact nearly jarred the shield from her hands but it knocked the creature onto its back unconscious Tika picked up her sword and grimacing in disgust stabbed the creature through the heart Its body immediately turned to stone encasing her sword Tika yanked at it but it remained stuck fast Tika to your left yelled Tasslehoff shrilly Tika stumbled around and saw another draconian Swinging her shield she blocked its sword thrust Then with a strength born of terror she hit at the creature again and again with her shield knowing only that she had to kill the thing She kept bashing until she felt a hand on her arm Whipping around her bloodstained shield ready she saw Caramon Its all right the big warrior said soothingly Its all over Tika Theyre all dead You did fine just fine Tika blinked For a moment she didnt recognize the warrior Then with a shudder she lowered her shield I wasnt very good with the sword she said starting to tremble in reaction to her fear and the memory of the horrible creature lunging at her Caramon saw her start to shake He reached out and clasped her in his arms stroking the sweatdamp red curls You were braver than many men Ive seenexperienced warriors the big man said in a deep voice Tika looked up into Caramons eyes Her terror melted away replaced by exultation She pressed against Caramon The feel of his hard muscles the smell of sweat mingled with leather increased her excitement Tika flung her arms around his neck and kissed him with such violence her teeth bit into his lip She tasted blood in her mouth Caramon astonished felt the tingle of pain an odd contrast to the softness of her lips and was overwhelmed with desire He wanted this woman more than any other womanand there had been manyin his life He forgot where he was who was around him His brain and his blood were on fire and he ached with the pain of his passion Crushing Tika to his chest he held her and kissed her with bruising intensity The pain of his embrace was delicious to Tika She longed for the pain to grow and envelop her but at the same time she felt suddenly cold and afraid Remembering stories told by the other barmaids of the terrible wonderful things that happened between men and women she began to panic Caramon completely lost all sense of reality He caught Tika up in his arms with a wild idea of carrying her into the woods when he felt a cold familiar hand on his shoulder The big man stared at his brother and regained his senses with a gasp He gently set Tika on her feet Dizzy and disoriented she opened her eyes to see Raistlin standing beside his brother regarding her with his strange glittering stare Tikas face burned She backed away stumbled over the body of the draconian then picked up her shield and ran Caramon swallowed cleared his throat and started to say something but Raistlin simply glanced at him in disgust and walked back to rejoin Fizban Caramon trembling like a newborn colt sighed shakily and walked over to where Sturm Tanis and Gilthanas stood talking to Eben No Im fine the man assured them I just felt a little faint when I saw those creatures thats all You really have a cleric among you Thats wonderful but dont waste her healing powers on me Just a scratch Its more their blood than mine My party and I were tracking these draconians through the woods when we were attacked by at least forty hobgoblins And you alone live to tell the tale Gilthanas said Yes Eben replied returning the elfs suspicious gaze I am an expert swordsmanas you know I killed thesehe gestured to the bodies of six hobgoblins who lay around him then fell to the overwhelming numbers The rest must have assumed I was dead and left me But enough of my heroics You fellows are pretty good with swords yourselves Where are you headed Some place called the Sla began Caramon but Gilthanas cut him off Our journey is secret Gilthanas said Then he added in a tentative voice We could use an expert swordsman As long as youre fighting draconians your fight is my fight Eben said cheerfully He pulled his pack out from under the body of a hobgoblin and slung it over his shoulder My names Eben Shatterstone I come from Gateway Youve probably heard of my family he said We had one of the most impressive mansions west of Thats it cried Fizban I remembered Suddenly the air was filled with strands of sticky floating cobweb The sun set just as the group reached an open plain edged by tall mountain peaks Rivaling the mountains for dominance of the land before it was the gigantic fortress known as Pax Tharkas which guarded the pass between the mountains The companions stared at it in awed silence Tikas eyes widened at the sight of the massive twin towers soaring into the sky Ive never seen anything so big Who built it They must have been powerful men It was not men said Flint sadly The dwarfs beard quivered as he looked at Pax Tharkas with a wistful expression It was elves and dwarves working together Once long ago when times were peaceful The dwarf speaks truly Gilthanas said Long ago KithKanan broke his fathers heart and left the ancient home of Silvanesti He and his people came to the beautiful woods given them by the Emperor of Ergoth following the scribing of the Swordsheath Scroll that ended the Kinslayer wars Elves have lived in Qualinesti for long centuries since KithKanans death His greatest achievement however was the building of Pax Tharkas Standing between elven and dwarven kingdoms it was constructed by both in a spirit of friendship since lost on Krynn It grieves me to see it now the bastion of a mighty war machine Even as Gilthanas spoke the companions saw the huge gate that stood at the front of Pax Tharkas swing open An armylong rows of draconians hobgoblins and goblinsmarched out into the plains The sound of braying horns echoed back from the mountaintops Watching them from above was a great red dragon The companions cowered among the scrub brush and trees Though the dragon was too far away to see them the dragonfear touched them even from this distance They march on Qualinesti Gilthanas said his voice breaking We must get inside and free the prisoners Then Verminaard will be forced to call the army back Youre going inside Pax Tharkas Eben gasped Yes Gilthanas answered reluctantly apparently regretting he had said so much Whew Eben blew out a deep breath You people have guts Ill give you that Sohow do we get in there Wait until the army leaves There will probably be only a couple of guards at the front gate We could handle them easily couldnt we big man He nudged Caramon Sure Caramon grinned That is not the plan Gilthanas said coldly The elf pointed to a narrow vale leading into the mountains just visible in the rapidly fading light There is our way We will cross in the cover of darkness He stood up and started off Tanis hurried forward to catch up with him What do you know of this Eben the halfelf asked in elven glancing back to where the man was chatting with Tika Gilthanas shrugged He was with the band of humans who fought with us at the ravine Those who survived were taken to Solace and died there I suppose he could have escaped I did after all Gilthanas said glancing sideways at Tanis He comes from Gateway where his father and father before him were wealthy merchants The others told me when he was out of hearing that his family lost their money and he has since earned his living by his sword I figured as much Tanis said His clothes are rich but theyve seen better days You made the right decision bringing him along I dared not leave him behind Gilthanas answered grimly One of us should keep an eye on him Yes Tanis fell silent And on me too youre thinking Gilthanas said in a tight voice I know what the others saythe knight especially But I swear to you Tanis Im not a traitor I want one thing The elfs eyes gleamed feverishly in the dying light I want to destroy this Verminaard If you could have seen him as his dragon destroyed my people Id gladly sacrifice my life Gilthanas stopped abruptly And our lives as well Tanis asked As Gilthanas turned to face him his almondshaped eyes regarding Tanis without emotion If you must know Tanthalas your life means that He snapped his fingers But the lives of my people are everything to me That is all I care for now He walked on ahead as Sturm caught up with them Tanis he said The old man was right We are being followed Suspicions grow The SlaMori The narrow trail climbed steeply up from the plains into a wooded valley in the foothills Evenings shadows gathered close around them as they followed the stream up into the mountain They had traveled only a short distance however when Gilthanas left the trail and disappeared into the brush The companions stopped looking at each other doubtfully This is madness Eben whispered to Tanis Trolls live in this valleywho do you think made that trail The darkhaired man took Taniss arm with a cool familiarity the halfelf found disconcerting Admittedly Im the new kid in town so to speak and the gods know you dont have any reason to trust me but how much do you know about this Gilthanas I know Tanis began but Eben ignored him There were some of us who didnt believe that draconian army stumbled onto us by accident if you take my meaning My boys and I had been hiding in the hills fighting the dragonarmies ever since they hit Gateway Last week these elves showed up out of nowhere They told us they were going to raid one of the Dragon Highlords fortresses and would we like to come along and help We said sure why notanything to stick a bone in the Dragon High Mans craw As we hiked we began to get really nervous There were draconian tracks all over the place But it didnt bother the elves Gilthanas said the tracks were old That night we made camp and posted a watch It didnt do us a lot of good just gave us about twenty seconds warning before the draconians hit And Eben glanced around and moved even closer while we were trying to wake up grab our weapons and fight those foul creatures I heard the elves calling out as if someone was lost And who do you suppose they were calling for Eben regarded Tanis intently The halfelf frowned and shook his head irritated at the dramatics Gilthanas Eben hissed He was gone They shouted and shouted for himtheir leader The man shrugged Whether he ever showed up or not I dont know I was captured They took us to Solace where I got away Anyway Id think twice about following that elf He may have had good reason to be gone when the draconians attacked but Ive known Gilthanas a long time Tanis interrupted gruffly more disturbed than he wanted to admit Sure Just thought you should know Eben said smiling sympathetically He clapped Tanis on the back and dropped back to stand by Tika Tanis didnt have to look around to know Caramon and Sturm had heard every word Neither said anything however and before Tanis could talk to them Gilthanas appeared suddenly slipping out from among the trees It is not much farther the elf said The brush thins up ahead and the walking is easier I say we just go in the front gate Eben said I agree Caramon said The big man glanced at his brother who sat limply beneath a tree Goldmoon was pale with fatigue Even Tasslehoffs head hung wearily We could camp here tonight and go in by the front gates at dawn Sturm suggested We stick to the original plan Tanis said sharply We make camp once we reach the SlaMori Then Flint spoke up You can go ring the bell at the gate and ask Lord Verminaard to let you in if you want Sturm Brightblade Im sure hed oblige Cmon Tanis The dwarf stumped off down the trail At least Tanis said to Sturm in a low voice maybe this will throw off our pursuer Whoever or whatever it is Sturm answered Its woodscrafty Ill say that for it Every time I caught a glimpse and started back for a closer look it vanished I thought about ambushing it but there wasnt time The group emerged from the brush thankfully arriving at the base of a gigantic granite cliff Gilthanas walked along the cliff face for several hundred feet his hand feeling for something on the rock Suddenly he stopped We are here he whispered Reaching into his tunic he removed a small gem that began to glow a soft muted yellow Running his hand over the rock wall the elf found what he was searching fora small niche in the granite He placed the gem in the niche and began reciting ancient words and tracing unseen symbols in the night air Very impressive whispered Fizban I didnt know he was one of us he said to Raistlin A dabbler nothing more the mage replied Leaning wearily on his staff he watched Gilthanas intently however Suddenly and silently a huge block of stone separated from the cliff face and began moving slowly to one side The companions backed up as a blast of chill dank air flowed from the gaping hole in the rock Whats in there Caramon asked suspiciously I do not know what is in there now Gilthanas replied I have never entered I know of this place only through the lore of my people All right Caramon growled What used to be in there Gilthanas paused then said This was the burial chamber of KithKanan More spooks Flint grumbled peering into the darkness Send the mage in first so he can warn them were coming Throw the dwarf in Raistlin returned They are accustomed to living in dark dank caves You speak of the mountain dwarves Flint said his beard bristling It has been long years since the hill dwarves lived below ground in the kingdom of Thorbardin Only because you were cast out Raistlin hissed Stop it both of you Tanis said in exasperation Raistlin what do you sense about this place Evil Great evil the mage replied But I sense great goodness too Fizban spoke unexpectedly The elves are not truly forgotten within though evil things have come to rule in their stead This is crazy Eben shouted The noise echoed uncannily among the rocks and the others whirled startled staring at him in alarm Im sorry he said dropping his voice But I cant believe you people are going in there It doesnt take a magician to tell theres evil inside that hole I can feel it Go back around to the front he urged Sure therell be one or two guardsbut thats nothing compared to whatever lurks in that darkness beyond Hes got a point Tanis Caramon said You cant fight the dead We learned that in Darken Wood This is the only way Gilthanas said angrily If you are such cowards Theres a difference between caution and cowardice Gilthanas Tanis said his voice steady and calm The halfelf thought a moment We might be able to take on the guards at the front gate but not before they could alert others I say we enter and at least explore this way Flint you lead Raistlin well need your light Shirak spoke the mage softly and the crystal on his staff began to glow He and Flint plunged into the cave followed closely by the rest The tunnel they entered was obviously ancient but whether it was natural or artifact was impossible to tell What about our pursuer Sturm asked in a low voice Do we leave the entrance open A trap Tanis agreed softly Leave it open just a crack Gilthanas enough so that whoevers tracking us knows we came in here and can follow but not enough so that it looks like a trap Gilthanas drew forth the gem placed it in a niche on the inner side of the entrance and spoke a few words The stone began to slide silently back into place At the last moment when it was about seven or eight inches from closing Gilthanas swiftly removed the gemstone The stone shuddered to a halt and the knight the elf and the halfelf joined the companions in the entrance to the SlaMori There is a great deal of dust Raistlin reported coughing but no tracks at least in this part of the cave About one hundred and twenty feet farther on theres a crossroads Flint added We found footprints there but we could not make out what they were They dont look like draconians or hobgoblins and they dont come this direction The mage says the evil flows from the road to the right We will camp here for the night Tanis said near the entry Well post double watchone by the door one down the corridor Sturm you and Caramon first Gilthanas and I Eben and Riverwind Flint and Tasslehoff And me said Tika stoutly though she couldnt ever remember being so tired in her life Ill take my turn Tanis was glad the darkness hid his smile Very well he said You watch with Flint and Tasslehoff Good Tika replied Opening her pack she shook out a blanket and lay down conscious all the while of Caramons eyes on her She noticed Eben watching her too She didnt mind that She was accustomed to men staring at her admiringly and Eben was handsomer even than Caramon Certainly he was wittier and more charming than the big warrior Still just the memory of Caramons arms around her made her shiver with delightful fear She firmly put the memory from her mind and tried to get comfortable The chain mail was cold and it pinched her through her blouse Yet she noticed the others didnt take theirs off Besides she was tired enough to sleep dressed in a full suit of plate armor The last thing Tika remembered as she drifted off was telling herself she was thankful she wasnt alone with Caramon Goldmoon saw the warriors eyes linger on Tika Whispering something to Riverwindwho nodded smilingshe left him and walked over to Caramon Touching him on the arm she drew him away from the others into the shadow of the corridor Tanis tells me you have an older sister she stated Yes Caramon answered startled Kitiara Though shes my halfsister Goldmoon smiled and laid her hand gently on Caramons arm Im going to talk to you like an older sister Caramon grinned Not like Kitiara you wont lady of Queshu Kit taught me the meaning of every swear word Id ever heard plus a few I hadnt She taught me to use a sword and fight with honor in the tournaments but she also taught me how to kick a man in the groin when the judges werent watching No lady youre not much like my older sister Goldmoons eyes opened wide startled by this portrayal of a woman she guessed the halfelf loved But I thought she and Tanis I mean they Caramon winked They certainly did he said Goldmoon drew a deep breath She hadnt meant the conversation to wander off but it did lead to her subject In a way thats what I wanted to speak to you about Only this has to do with Tika Tika Caramon flushed Shes a big girl Begging your pardon I dont see that what we do is any of your concern She is a girl Caramon Goldmoon said gently Dont you understand Caramon looked blank He knew Tika was a girl What did Goldmoon mean Then he blinked in sudden understanding and groaned No she isnt Yes Goldmoon sighed She is Shes never been with a man before She told me while we were in the grove putting on her armor Shes frightened Caramon Shes heard a lot of stories Dont rush her She desperately wants approval from you and she might do anything to win it But dont let her use that as a reason to do something shell regret later If you truly love her time will prove it and enhance the moments sweetness I guess you know that huh Caramon said looking at Goldmoon Yes she said softly her eyes going to Riverwind We have waited long and sometimes the pain is unbearable But the laws of my people are strict I dont suppose it would matter now she spoke in a whisper more to herself than Caramon since we are the only two left But in a way that makes it even more important When our vows are spoken we will lie together as man and wife Not until then I understand Thanks for telling me about Tika Caramon said He patted Goldmoon awkwardly on the shoulder and returned to his post The night passed quietly with no sign of their pursuer When the watches changed Tanis discussed Ebens story with Gilthanas and received an unsatisfactory answer Yes what the man said was true Gilthanas had been gone when the draconians attacked He had been trying to convince the druids to help Hed returned when he heard the sounds of battle and thats when hed been struck on the head He told Tanis all this in a low bitter voice The companions woke when mornings pale light crept through the door After a quick breakfast they gathered their things and walked down the corridor into the SlaMori Arriving at the crossroads they examined both directionsleft and right Riverwind knelt to study the tracks then rose his expression puzzled They are human he said but they are not human There are animal tracks as wellprobably rats The dwarf was right I see no sign of draconians or goblins What is odd however is that the animal tracks end right here where the paths cross They do not go into the righthand corridor The other strange tracks do not go to the left Well which way do we go Tanis asked I say we dont go either way Eben stated The entrance is still open Lets turn back Turning back is no longer an option Tanis said coldly I would give you leave to go yourself only Only you dont trust me Eben finished I dont blame you Tanis HalfElven All right I said Id help and I meant it Which wayleft or right The evil comes from the right Raistlin whispered Gilthanas Tanis asked Do you have any idea where we are No Tanthalas the elf answered Legend says that there were many entrances from SlaMori into Pax Tharkasall secret Only the elven priests were allowed down here to honor the dead One way is as good as another Or as bad whispered Tasslehoff to Tika She gulped and crept over to stand near Caramon Well go left Tanis said since Raistlin feels uneasy about the right Walking by the light of the mages staff the companions followed the dusty rockstrewn tunnel for several hundred feet then reached an ancient stone wall rent by a huge hole through which only darkness was visible Raistlins small light showed faintly the distant walls of a great hall The warriors entered first flanking the mage who held his staff high The gigantic hall must once have been splendid but now it had fallen into such decay that its faded splendor seemed pathetic and horrible Two rows of seven columns ran the length of the hall though some lay shattered on the floor Part of the far wall was caved in evidence of the destructive force of the Cataclysm At the very back of the room stood two double bronze doors As Raistlin advanced the others spread out swords drawn Suddenly Caramon in the front of the hall gave a strangled cry The mage hurried to shine his light where Caramon pointed with a trembling hand Before them was a massive throne ornately carved of granite Two huge marble statues flanked the throne their sightless eyes staring forward into the darkness The throne they guarded was not empty Upon it sat the skeletal remains of what had once been a maleof what race none could say death being the great equalizer The figure was dressed in regal robes that even though faded and decayed still gave evidence of their richness A cloak covered the gaunt shoulders A crown gleamed on the fleshless skull The bone hands fingers lying gracefully in death rested on a sheathed sword Gilthanas fell to his knees KithKanan he said in a whisper We stand in the Hall of the Ancients his burial tomb None have seen this sight since the elven clerics vanished in the Cataclysm Tanis stared at the throne until slowly overcome by feelings he did not understand the halfelf sank to his knees Fealan thalos Im murquanethi Sai KithKananoth Mwtari Larion he murmured in tribute to the greatest of the elven kings What a beautiful sword Tasslehoff said his shrill voice breaking the reverent silence Tanis glared at him sternly Im not going to take it the kender protested looking wounded I just mentioned it as an item of interest Tanis rose to his feet Dont touch it he said sternly to the kender then went to explore other parts of the room As Tas walked closer to examine the sword Raistlin went with him The mage began to murmur Tsaran korilath ith hakon and moved his thin hand swiftly above the sword in a prescribed pattern The sword began to give off a faint red glow Raistlin smiled and said softly It is enchanted Tas gasped Good enchantment Or bad I have no way of knowing the mage whispered But since it has lain undisturbed for so long I certainly would not venture to touch it He turned away leaving Tas to wonder if he dared disobey Tanis and risk being turned into something icky While the kender was wrestling with temptation the others searched the walls for secret entrances Flint helped by giving them learned and lengthy descriptions of dwarvenbuilt hidden doorways Gilthanas walked to the far end from KithKanans throne where the two huge bronze double doors stood One bearing a relief map of Pax Tharkas was slightly ajar Calling for light he and Raistlin studied the map Caramon gave the skeletal figure of the long dead king a final backward glance and joined Sturm and Flint in searching the walls for secret doors Finally Flint called Tasslehoff you worthless kender this is your speciality At least youre always bragging about how you found the door that had been lost for one hundred years which led to the great jewel of the somethingorother It was in a place like this too Tas said his interest in the sword forgotten Skipping over to help he came to a sudden stop Whats that he asked cocking his head Whats what Flint said absently slapping the walls A scraping sound the kender said puzzled Its coming from those doors Tanis looked up having learned long ago to respect Tasslehoffs hearing He walked toward the doors where Gilthanas and Raistlin were intent upon the map Suddenly Raistlin took a step backwards Foulsmelling air wafted into the room through the open door Now everyone could hear the scraping sound and a soft squishing noise Shut the door Raistlin whispered urgently Caramon Tanis cried Sturm The two were already running for the door along with Eben All of them leaned against it but they were flung backwards as the bronze doors flew open banging against the walls with a hollow booming sound A monster slithered into the hall Help us Mishakal Goldmoon breathed the goddesss name as she sank back against the wall The thing entered the room swiftly despite its great bulk The scraping sound they had heard was caused by its gigantic bloated body sliding along the floor A slug Tas said running up to examine it with interest But look at the size of that thing How do you suppose it got so big I wonder what it eats Us you ninny Flint shouted grabbing the kender and flinging him to the ground just as the huge slug spat out a stream of saliva Its eyes perched atop slender rotating stalks on top of its head were not of much use nor did it need them The slug could find and devour rats in the darkness by sense of smell alone Now it detected much larger prey and it shot its paralyzing saliva in the general direction of the living flesh it craved The deadly liquid missed as the kender and the dwarf rolled out of the way Sturm and Caramon charged in slashing at the monster with their swords Caramons sword didnt even penetrate the thick rubbery hide Sturms twohanded blade bit causing the slug to rear back in pain Tanis charged forward as the slugs head swiveled toward the knight Tanthalas The scream pierced Taniss concentration and he halted turning back to stare in amazement at the entrance to the hall Laurana At that moment the slug sensing the halfelf spat the corrosive liquid at him The saliva struck his sword causing the metal to fizz and smoke then dissolve in his hand The burning liquid ran down his arm searing his flesh Tanis screaming in agony fell to his knees Tanthalas Laurana cried again running to him Stop her Tanis gasped doubled over in pain clutching a hand and swordarm suddenly blackened and useless The slug sensing success slithered forward dragging its pulsating gray body through the door Goldmoon cast a fearful glance at the huge monster then ran to Tanis Riverwind stood over them protectively Get away Tanis said through clenched teeth Goldmoon grasped his injured hand in her own praying to the goddess Riverwind fit an arrow to his bow and shot at the slug The arrow struck the creature in the neck doing little damage but distracting its attention from Tanis The halfelf saw Goldmoons hand touch his but he could feel nothing but pain Then the pain eased and feeling returned to his hand Smiling at Goldmoon he marveled at her healing powers even as he lifted his head to see what was happening The others were attacking the creature with renewed fury attempting to distract it from Tanis but they might as well have been plunging their weapons into a thick rubbery wall Tanis rose to his feet shakily His hand was healed but his sword lay on the ground a molten lump of metal Weaponless except for his longbow he fell back pulling Goldmoon with him as the slug slid into the room Raistlin ran to Fizbans side Now is the time for the casting of the fireball Old One he panted It is Fizbans face filled with delight Wonderful How does it go Dont you remember Raistlin practically shrieked dragging the mage behind a pillar as the slug spat another glob of burning saliva onto the floor I used to let me see Fizbans brow furrowed in concentration Cant you do it I have not gained the power yet Old One That spell is still beyond my strength Raistlin closed his eyes and began to concentrate on those spells he did know Fall back Get out of here Tanis shouted shielding Laurana and Goldmoon as best he could while he fumbled for his longbow and his arrows Itll just come after us Sturm yelled thrusting his blade home once again But all he and Caramon accomplished was to enrage the monster further Suddenly Raistlin held up his hands Kalith karan tobaniskarf he cried and flaming darts sprang from his fingers striking the creature in the head The slug reared in silent agony and shook its head but returned to the hunt Suddenly it lunged straight forward sensing victims at the end of the room where Tanis sought to protect Goldmoon and Laurana Maddened by pain driven wild by the smell of blood the slug attacked with unbelievable speed Taniss arrow bounced off the leathery hide and the monster dove for him its mouth gaping open The halfelf dropped the useless bow and staggered backwards nearly stumbling over the steps leading to the throne of KithKanan Behind the throne he yelled preparing to hold the monsters attention while Goldmoon and Laurana ran for cover His hand reached out grabbing for a huge rockanything to hurl at the creaturewhen his fingers closed over the metal hilt of a sword Tanis nearly dropped the weapon in amazement The metal was so cold it burned his hand The blade gleamed brightly in the wavering light of the mages staff There wasnt time to question however Tanis drove the point into the slugs gaping maw just as the creature swooped in for the kill Run Tanis yelled Grasping Lauranas hand he dragged her toward the hole Pushing her through he turned around preparing to help keep the slug at bay while the others escaped But the slugs appetite had died Writhing in misery it slowly turned and slithered back toward its lair Clear sticky liquid dribbled from its wounds The companions crowded into the tunnel stopping for a moment to calm their hearts and breathe deeply Raistlin wheezing leaned on his brother Tanis glanced around Wheres Tasslehoff he asked in frustration Whirling around to go back into the hall he nearly fell over the kender I brought you the scabbard Tas said holding it up For the sword Back down the tunnel Tanis said firmly stopping everyones questions Reaching the crossroads and sinking down on the dusty floor to rest Tanis turned to the elf maid What in the name of the Abyss are you doing here Laurana Has something happened in Qualinost Nothing happened Laurana said shaking from the encounter with the slug I I just came Then youre going right back Gilthanas yelled angrily grabbing Laurana She broke away from his grasp Im not either going back she said petulantly Im coming with you and Tanis and the rest Laurana this is madness Tanis snapped Were not going on an outing This isnt a game You saw what happened in therewe were nearly killed I know Tanthalas Laurana said pleadingly Her voice quivered and broke You told me that there comes a time when youve got to risk your life for something you believe in Im the one who followed you You could have been killed Gilthanas began But I wasnt Laurana cried defiantly I have been trained as a warriorall elven women are in memory of the time when we fought beside our men to save our homeland Its not serious training Tanis began angrily I followed you didnt I Laurana demanded casting a glance at Sturm Skillfully she asked the knight Yes he admitted Still that doesnt mean Raistlin interrupted him We are losing time the mage whispered And I for one do not want to spend any longer than I must in this dank and musty tunnel He was wheezing barely able to breathe The girl has made her decision We can spare no one to return with her nor do we dare trust her to leave on her own She might be captured and reveal our plans We must take her Tanis glared at the mage hating him for his cold unfeeling logic and for being right The halfelf stood up yanking Laurana to her feet He came very close to hating her too without quite understanding why knowing simply that she was making a difficult task much harder You are on your own he told her quietly as the rest stood up and gathered their things I cant hang around protecting you Neither can Gilthanas You have behaved like a spoiled brat I told you once beforeyou better grow up Now if you dont youre going to die and probably get all the rest of us killed right along with you Im sorry Tanthalas Laurana said avoiding his angry gaze But I couldnt lose you not again I love you Her lips tightened and she said softly Ill make you proud of me Tanis turned and walked away Catching sight of Caramons grinning face and hearing Tika giggle he flushed Ignoring them he approached Sturm and Gilthanas It seems we must take the righthand corridor after all whether or not Raistlins feelings about evil are correct He buckled on his new sword belt and scabbard noticing as he did so Raistlins eyes lingering on the weapon What is it now he asked irritably The sword is enchanted Raistlin said softly coughing How did you get it Tanis started He stared at the blade moving his hand as though it might turn into a snake He frowned trying to remember I was near the body of the elven king searching for something to throw at the slug when suddenly the sword was in my hand It had been taken out of the sheath and Tanis paused swallowing Yes Raistlin pursued his eyes glittering eagerly He gave it to me Tanis said softly I remember his hand touched mine He pulled it from its sheath Who asked Gilthanas None of us were near there KithKanan The Royal Guard The Chain Room Perhaps it was just imagination but the darkness seemed thicker as they walked down the other tunnel and the air grew colder No one needed the dwarf to tell them that this was not normal in a cave where the temperature supposedly stayed constant They reached a branch in the tunnel but no one felt inclined to go left which might lead them back to the Hall of the Ancientsand the wounded slug The elf almost got us killed by the slug Eben said accusingly I wonder whats in store for us down here No one answered By now everyone was experiencing the sense of growing evil Raistlin had warned of Their footsteps slowed and it was only through force of group will that they continued on Laurana felt fear convulse her limbs and she clung to the wall for support She longed for Tanis to comfort her and protect her as he had done when they were younger and facing imaginary foes but he walked at the head of the line with her brother Each had his own fear to contend with At that moment Laurana decided that she would die before she asked for their help It occurred to her then that she was really serious when she said she wanted to make Tanis proud of her Shoving herself away from the side of the crumbling tunnel she gritted her teeth and moved forward The tunnel came to an abrupt end Crumbled stone and rubble lay beneath a hole in the rock wall The sense of malevolent evil flowing from the darkness beyond the hole could almost be felt wafting across the flesh like the touch of unseen fingers The companions stopped none of themnot even the nerveless kenderdaring to enter Its not that Im afraid Tas confided in a whisper to Flint Its just that Id rather be somewhere else The silence became oppressive Each could hear his own heart beat and the breathing of the others The light jittered and wavered in the mages shaking hand Well we cant stay here forever Eben said hoarsely Let the elf go in Hes the one who brought us here Ill go Gilthanas answered But Ill need light None may touch the staff but I Raistlin hissed He paused then added reluctantly Ill go with you Raist Caramon began but his brother stared at him coldly Ill go too the big man muttered No Tanis said You stay here and guard the others Gilthanas Raistlin and I will go Gilthanas entered the hole in the wall followed by the mage and Tanis the halfelf assisting Raistlin The light revealed a narrow chamber vanishing into darkness beyond the staffs reach On either side were rows of large stone doors each held in place by huge iron hinges spiked directly into the rock wall Raistlin held the staff high shining it down the shadowy chamber Each knew that the evil was centered here Theres carving on the doors Tanis murmured The staffs light threw the stone figures into high relief Gilthanas stared at it The Royal Crest he said in a strangled voice What does that mean Tanis asked feeling the elfs fear infect him like a plague These are the crypts of the Royal Guard Gilthanas whispered They are pledged to continue their duties even in death and guard the kingso the legends speak And so the legends come to life Raistlin breathed gripping Taniss arm Tanis heard the sound of huge stone blocks shifting of rusting iron hinges creaking Turning his head he saw each of the stone doors begin to swing wide The hallway filled with a cold so severe that Tanis felt his fingers go numb Things moved behind the stone doors The Royal Guard They made the tracks Raistlin whispered frantically Human and not human There is no escape he said grasping Tanis tighter Unlike the spectres of Darken Wood these have but one thoughtto destroy all who commit the sacrilege of disturbing the kings rest Weve got to try Tanis said unclenching the mages biting fingers from his arm He stumbled backwards and reached the entryway only to find it blocked by two figures Get back Tanis gasped Run Who Fizban No you crazy old man Weve got to run The dead guards Oh calm down the old man muttered Young people Alarmists He turned around and helped someone else enter It was Goldmoon her hair gleaming in the light Its all right Tanis she called softly Look She drew aside her cape the medallion she wore glowed blue Fizban said they would let us pass Tanis if they saw the medallion And when he said thatit began to glow No Tanis started to order her back but Fizban tapped him on the chest with a long bony finger Youre a good man Tanis HalfElven the old mage said softly but you worry too much Now just relax and let us send these poor souls back to their sleep Bring the others along will you Tanis too startled for words fell back as Goldmoon and Fizban walked past Riverwind following As Tanis watched they walked slowly between the rows of gaping stone doors Behind each stone door movement ceased as she passed Even at that distance he could feel the sense of malevolent evil slip away As the others came to the crumbling entryway and he helped them through he answered their whispered questions with a shrug Laurana didnt say a word to him as she entered her hand was cold to the touch and he could see to his astonishment blood on her lip Knowing she must have bitten it to keep from screaming Tanis remorseful started to say something to her But the elfmaid held her head high and refused to look at him The others ran after Goldmoon hurriedly but Tasslehoff pausing to peek into one of the crypts saw a tall figure dressed in resplendent armor lying on a stone bier Skeletal hands grasped the hilt of a longsword lying across the body Tas looked up at the Royal Crest curiously sounding out the words Sothi Nuinqua Tsalarioth said Tanis coming up behind the kender What does it mean Tas asked Faithful beyond Death Tanis said softly At the west end of the crypts they found a set of bronze double doors Goldmoon pushed it open easily and led them into a triangular passage that opened into a large hall Inside this room the only difficulty they faced was in trying to get the dwarf out of it The hall was perfectly intactthe only room in the SlaMori they had encountered so far that had survived the Cataclysm without damage And the reason for that Flint explained to anyone who would listen was the wonderful dwarven constructionparticularly the twentythree columns supporting the ceiling The only way out was two identical bronze doors at the far end of the chamber leading west Flint tearing himself away from the columns examined each and grumbled that he hadnt any idea what was behind them or where they led After a brief discussion Tanis decided to take the door to his right The door opened onto a clean narrow passageway that led them after about thirty feet to another single bronze door This door however was locked Caramon pushed tugged priedall to no avail Its no use the big man grunted It wont budge Flint watched Caramon for several minutes then finally stumped forward Examining the door he snorted and shook his head Jts a false door Looks real to me Caramon said staring at the door suspiciously Its even got hinges Of course it does Flint snorted We dont build false doors to look falseeven a gully dwarf knows that So were at a dead end Eben said grimly Stand back Raistlin whispered carefully leaning his staff against a wall He placed both hands on the door touching it only with the tips of his fingers then said Khetsaram pak7io There was a flare of orange light but not from the doorit came from the wall Move Raistlin grabbed his brother and jerked him back just as the entire wall bronze door and all began to pivot Quickly before it shuts Tanis said and everyone hurried through the door Caramon catching his brother as Raistlin staggered Are you all right Caramon asked as the wall slammed shut behind them Yes the weakness will pass Raistlin whispered That is the first spell I have cast from the spellbook of Fistandantilus The spell of opening worked but I did not believe it would drain me like this The door led them into another passageway that ran straight west for about forty feet took a sharp turn to the south then east then continued south again Here the way was blocked by another single bronze door Raistlin shook his head I can only use the spell once It is gone from my memory A fireball would open the door said Fizban I think I remember that spell now No Old One Tanis said hastily It would fry all of us in this narrow passage Tas Reaching the door the kender pushed on it Drat its open he said disappointed not to have to pick a lock He peered inside Just another room They entered cautiously Raistlin illuminating the chamber with the staffs light The room was perfectly round about one hundred feet in diameter Directly across from them to the south stood a bronze door and in the center of the room A crooked column Tas said giggling Look Flint The dwarves built a crooked column If they did they had a good reason the dwarf snapped shoving the kender aside to examine the tall thin column It definitely slanted Hmmmm said Flint puzzled Then It isnt a column at all you doorknob Flint exploded Its a great huge chain Look you can see here its hooked to an iron bracket on the floor Then we are in the Chain Room Gilthanas said in excitement This is the famed defense mechanism of Pax Tharkas We must be almost in the fortress The companions gathered around staring at the monstrous chain in wonder Each link was as long as Caramon was tall and as thick around as the trunk of an oak What does the mechanism do asked Tasslehoff longing to climb up the great chain Where does this lead The chain leads to the mechanism itself Gilthanas answered As to how it works you must ask the dwarf for I am unfamiliar with engineering But if this chain is released from its mooringshe pointed to the iron bracket in the floormassive blocks of granite drop down behind the gates of the fortress Then no force on Krynn can open them Leaving the kender to peer up into the shadowy darkness trying in vain to get a glimpse of the wondrous mechanism Gilthanas joined the others in searching the room Look at this he finally cried pointing to a faint doorshaped line in the stones on the north wall A secret door This must be the entrance Theres the catch Tasslehoff turning from the chain pointed to a chipped piece of stone at the bottom The dwarves slipped up he said grinning at Flint This is a false door that looks false And therefore not to be trusted Flint said flatly Bah dwarves have bad days like everyone else Eben said bending down to try the catch Dont open it Raistlin said suddenly Why not asked Sturm Because you want to alert someone before we find the way into Pax Tharkas If I had wanted to betray you knight I could have done so a thousand times before this Raistlin hissed staring at the secret door I sense a power behind that door greater than any I have felt since He stopped shuddering Since when his brother prompted gently The Towers of High Sorcery Raistlin whispered I warn you do not open that door See where the south door leads Tanis told the dwarf Flint stumped over to the bronze door on the south wall and shoved it open Near as I can tell it leads down another passage exactly like all the others he reported glumly The way to Pax Tharkas is through a secret door Gilthanas repeated Before anyone could stop him he reached down and pulled out the chipped stone The door shivered and began to swing silently inward You will regret this Raistlin choked The door slid aside to reveal a large room nearly filled with yellow bricklike objects Through a thick layer of dust a faint yellowish color was visible A treasure room Eben cried Weve found the treasure of KithKanan All in gold Strum said coldly Worthless these days since steels the only thing of any value His voice trailed off his eyes widened in horror What is it shouted Caramon drawing his sword I dont know Sturm said more as a gasp than words I do Raistlin breathed as the thing took shape before his eyes It is the spirit of a dark elf I warned you not to open that door Do something Eben said stumbling backwards Put up your weapons fools Raistlin said in a piercing whisper You cannot fight her Her touch is death and if she wails while we are within these walls we are doomed Her keening voice alone kills Run run all of you Quickly Through the south door Even as they fell back the darkness in the treasure room took shape coalescing into the coldly beautiful distorted features of a female drowan evil elf of ages past whose punishment for crimes unspeakable had been execution Then the powerful elven magicusers chained her spirit forcing her to guard forever the kings treasure At the sight of these living beings she streched out her hands craving the warmth of flesh and opened her mouth to scream out her grief and her hatred of all living things The companions turned and fled stumbling over each other in their haste to escape through the bronze door Caramon fell over his brother knocking the staff from Raistlins hand The staff clattered on the floor its light still glowing for only dragonfire can destroy the magic crystal But now its light flared out over the floor plunging the rest of the room into darkness Seeing her prey escaping the spirit flitted into the Chain Room her grasping hand brushing Ebens cheek He screamed at the chilling burning touch and collapsed Sturm caught him and dragged him through the door just as Raistlin grabbed his staff and he and Caramon lunged through Is that everyone Tanis asked reluctant to close the door Then he heard a low moaning sound so frightful that he felt his heart stop beating for a moment Fear seized him He couldnt breathe The cry ceased and his heart gave a great painful leap The spirit sucked in its breath to scream again No time to look Raistlin gasped Shut the door brother Caramon threw all his weight on the bronze door It slammed shut with a boom that echoed through the hall That wont stop her Eben cried panicstricken No said Raistlin softly Her magic is powerful more powerful than mine I can cast a spell on the door but it will weaken me greatly I suggest you run while you can If it fails perhaps I can stall her Riverwind take the others on ahead Tanis orderd Sturm and Ill stay with Raistlin and Caramon The others crept down the dark corridor looking back to watch in horrible fascination Raistlin ignored them and handed the staff to his brother The light from the glowing crystal flashed out at the unfamiliar touch The mage put his hands on the door pressing both palms flat against it Closing his eyes he forced himself to forget everything except the magic Kalisan budrunin His concentration broke as he felt a terrible chill The dark elf She had recognized his spell and was trying to break him Images of his battle with another dark elf in the Towers of High Sorcery came back to his mind He struggled to blot out the evil memory of the battle that wrecked his body and came close to destroying his mind but he felt himself losing control He had forgotten the words The door trembled The elf was coming through Then from somewhere inside the mage came a strength he had discovered within himself only twice beforein the Tower and on the altar of the black dragon in Xak Tsaroth The familiar voice that he could hear clearly in his mind yet never identify spoke to him repeating the words of the spell Raistlin shouted them aloud in a strong clear voice that was not his own Kalisan budrunin karaemarath From the other side of the door came a wail of disappointment failure The door held The mage collapsed Caramon handed the staff to Eben as he picked up his brother in his arms and followed the others as they groped their way along the dark passage Another secret door opened easily to Flints hand leading to a series of short debrisfilled tunnels Trembling with fear the companions wearily made their way past these obstacles Finally they emerged into a large open room filled from ceiling to floor with stacks of wooden crates Riverwind lit a torch on the wall The crates were nailed shut Some bore the label SOLACE some GATEWAY This is it Were inside the fortress Gilthanas said grimly victorious We stand in the cellar of Pax Tharkas Thank the true gods Tanis sighed and sank onto the floor the others slumping down beside him It was then they noticed that Fizban and Tasslehoff were missing Lost The plan Betrayed Tasslehoff could never afterwards clearly recall those last few panicked moments in the Chain Room He remembered saying A dark elf Where and standing on his tiptoes trying desperately to see when suddenly the glowing staff fell on the floor He heard Tanis shouting andabove thata kind of a moaning sound that made the kender lose all sense of where he was or what he was doing Then strong hands grabbed him around the waist lifting him up into the air Climb shouted a voice beneath him Tasslehoff stretched out his hands felt the cool metal of the chain and began to climb He heard a door boom far below and the chilling wail of the dark elf again It didnt sound deadly this time more like a cry of rage and anger Tas hoped this meant his friends had escaped I wonder how Ill find them again he asked himself softly feeling discouraged for a moment Then he heard Fizban muttering to himself and cheered up He wasnt alone Thick heavy darkness wrapped around the kender Climbing by feel alone he was growing extremely tired when he felt cool air brush his right cheek He sensed rather than saw that he must be coming to the place where the chain and the mechanism linked up Tas was rather proud of that pun If only he could see Then he remembered He was after all with a magician We could use a light Tas called out A fight Where Fizban nearly lost his grip on the chain Not fight Light Tas said patiently clinging to a link I think were near the top of this thing and we really ought to have a look around Oh certainly Lets see light Tas heard the magician fumbling in his pouches Apparently he found what he was searching for because he soon gave a little crow of triumph spoke a few words and a small puffball of bluishyellow flame appeared hovering near the magicians hat The glowing puffball whizzed up danced around Tasslehoff as if to inspect the kender then returned to the proud magician Tas was enchanted He had all sorts of questions regarding the wonderful flaming puffball but his arms were getting shaky and the old magician was nearly done in He knew they better find some way to get off this chain Looking up he saw that they were as he had guessed at the top part of the fortress The chain ran up over a huge wooden cogwheel mounted on an iron axle anchored in solid stone The links of the chain fit over teeth big as tree trunks then the chain stretched out across the wide shaft disappearing into a tunnel to the kenders right We can climb onto that gear and crawl along the chain into the tunnel the kender said pointing Can you send the light up here Lightto the wheel Fizban instructed The light wavered in the air for a moment then danced back and forth in a decidedly naysaying manner Fizban frowned Lightto the wheel he repeated firmly The puffball flame darted around to hide behind the magicians hat Fizban making a wild grab for it nearly fell and flung both arms around the chain The puffball light danced in the air behind him as if enjoying the game Uh I guess weve got enough light after all Tas said No discipline in the younger generation Fizban grumbled His fathernow there was a puffball The old magicians voice died away as he began to climb again the puffball flame hovering near the tip of his battered hat Tas soon reached the first tooth on the wheel Discovering the teeth were rough hewn and easy to climb Tas crawled from one to another until he reached the top Fizban his robes hiked up around his thighs followed with amazing agility Could you ask the light to shine in the tunnel Tas asked Lightto the tunnel Fizban ordered his bony legs wrapped around a link in the chain The puffball appeared to consider the command Slowly it skittered to the edge of the tunnel and then stopped Inside the tunnel the magician commanded The puffball flame refused I think its afraid of the dark Fizban said apologetically My goodness how remarkable the kender said in astonishment Well he thought for a moment if it will stay where it is I think I can see enough to make my way across the chain It looks like its only about fifteen feet or so to the tunnel With nothing below but several hundred feet of darkness and air never mind the stone floor at the bottom Tas thought Someone should come up here and grease this thing Fizban said examining the axle critically Thats all you get today shoddy workmanship Im really rather glad they didnt Tas said mildly crawling forward onto the chain About halfway across the gap the kender considered what it would be like to fall from this height tumbling down and down and down then hitting the stone floor at the bottom He wondered what it would feellike to splatter all over the floor Get a move on Fizban shouted crawling out onto the chain after the kender Tas crawled forward quickly to the tunnel entrance where the puffball flame waited then jumped off the chain onto the stone floor about five feet below him The puffball flame darted in after him and finally Fizban reached the tunnel entrance too At the last moment he fell but Tas caught hold of his robes and dragged the old man to safety They were sitting on the floor resting when suddenly the old mans head snapped up My staff he said What about it Tas yawned wondering what time it was The old man struggled to his feet Left it down below he mumbled heading for the chain Wait You cant go back Tasslehoff jumped up in alarm Who says asked the old man petulantly his beard bristling I mmean Tas stuttered it would be too dangerous But I know you how feelmy hoopaks down there Hmmmm Fizban said sitting back down disconsolately Was it magic Tas asked after a moment I was never quite certain Fizban said wistfully Well said Tas practically maybe after weve finished the adventure we can go back and get it Now lets try to find someplace to rest He glanced around the tunnel It was about seven feet from floor to ceiling The huge chain ran along the top with numerous smaller chains attached stretching across the tunnel floor into a vast dark pit beyond Tas staring down into it could vaguely make out the shape of gigantic boulders What time do you suppose it is Tas asked Lunchtime said the old man And we might as well rest right here Its as safe a place as any He plopped back down Pulling out a handful of quithpa he began to chew on it noisily The puffball flame wandered over and settled on the brim of the magicians hat Tas sat down next to the mage and began to nibble on his own bit of dried fruit Then he sniffed There was suddenly a very peculiar smell like someone burning old socks Looking up he sighed and tugged on the magicians robe Uh Fizban he said Your hats on fire Flint Tanis said sternly for the last timeI feel as badly as you do about losing Tas but we cannot go back Hes with Fizban andknowing those twotheyll both manage to get out of whatever predicament theyre in If they dont bring the whole fortress down around our ears Sturm muttered The dwarf wiped his hand across his eyes glared at Tanis then whirled on his heel and stumped back to a corner where he hurled himself onto the floor sulking Tanis sat back down He knew how Flint felt It seemed oddthered been so many times he could happily have strangled the kender but now that he was gone Tanis missed himand for exactly the same reasons There was an innate unfailing cheerfulness about Tasslehoff that made him an invaluable companion No danger ever frightened a kender and therefore Tas never gave up He was never at a loss for something to do in an emergency It might not always be the right thing but at least he was ready to act Tanis smiled sadly I only hope this emergency doesnt prove to be his last he thought The companions rested for an hour eating quithpa and drinking fresh water from a deep well they discovered Raistlin regained consciousness but could eat nothing He sipped water then lay limply back Caramon broke the news to him about Fizban hesitantly fearing his brother might take the old mages disappearance badly But Raistlin simply shrugged closed his eyes and sank into a deep sleep After Tanis felt his strength return he rose and walked toward Gilthanas noting that the elf was intently studying a map Passing Laurana who sat alone he smiled at her She refused to acknowledge it Tanis sighed Already he regretted speaking harshly to her back in the SlaMori He had to admit that she had handled herself remarkably well under terrifying circumstances She had done what she was told to quickly and without question Tanis supposed he would have to apologize but first he needed to talk to Gilthanas Whats the plan he asked sitting down on a crate Yes where are we Sturm asked Soon almost everyone was crowded around the map except Raistlin who appeared to sleep though Tanis thought he saw a slit of gold shining through the mages supposedly closed eyelids Gilthanas spread his map flat Here is the fortress of Pax Tharkas and the surrounding mine area he said then he pointed We are in the cellars here on the lowest level Down this hallway about fifty feet from here are the rooms where the women are imprisoned This is a guard room across from the women and thishe tapped the map gentlyis the lair of one of the red dragons the one Lord Verminaard called Ember The dragon is so big of course that the lair extends up above ground level communicating with Lord Verminaards chambers on the first floor up through the gallery on the second floor and out into the open sky Gilthanas smiled bitterly On the first floor behind Verminaards chambers is the prison where the children are kept The Dragon Highlord is wise He keeps the hostages separated knowing that the women would never consider leaving without their children and the men would not leave without their families The children are guarded by a second red dragon in this room The menabout three hundred of themwork in mines out in the mountain caves There are several hundred gully dwarves working the mines as well You seem to know a lot about Pax Tharkas Eben said Gilthanas glanced up quickly What do you insinuate Im not insinuating anything Eben answered Its just that you know a lot about this place for never having been here And wasnt it interesting that we kept running into creatures who damn near killed us back in the SlaMori Eben Tanis spoke very quietly weve had enough of your suspicions I dont believe any of us is a traitor As Raistlin said the traitor could have betrayed any of us long before this Whats the point of coming this far To bring me and the Disks to Lord Verminaard Goldmoon said softly He knows I am here Tanis He and I are linked by our faith Thats ridiculous Sturm snorted No it isnt Goldmoon said Remember there are two constellations missing One was the Queen of Darkness From what little I have been able to understand in the Disks of Mishakal the Queen was also one of the ancient gods The gods of good are matched by the gods of evil with the gods of neutrality striving to keep the balance Verminaard worships the Queen of Darkness as I worship Mishakal that is what Mishakal meant when she said we were to restore the balance The promise of good that I bring is the one thing he fears and he is exerting all his will to find me The longer I stay here Her voice died All the more reason to quit bickering Tanis stated switching his gaze to Eben The fighter shrugged Enough said Im with you What is your plan Gilthanas Tanis asked noticing with irritation that Sturm and Caramon and Eben exchanged quick glancesthree humans sticking togehter against the elves he caught himself thinking But perhaps Im just as bad believing in Gilthanas because hes an elf Gilthanas saw the exchange of glances too For a moment he stared at them with an intense unblinking gaze then began to speak in a measured tone considering his words as if reluctant to reveal any more than was absolutely necessary Every evening ten to twelve women are allowed to leave their cells and take food to the men in the mines Thus the Highlord lets the men see that he is keeping his side of the bagain The women are allowed to visit the children once a day for the same reason My warriors and I planned to disguise ourselves as women go out to the men in the mines tell them of the plan to free the hostages and alert them to be ready to strike Beyond that we had not thought particularly in regard to freeing the children Our spies indicated something strange about the dragon guarding the children but we could not determine what What sp Caramon started to ask caught Taniss eye and thought better of his question Instead he asked When will we strike And what about the dragon Ember We strike tomorrow morning Lord Verminaard and Ember will most certainly join the army tomorrow as it reaches the outskirts of Qualinesti He has been preparing for this invasion a long time I do not believe he will miss it The group discussed the plan for several minutes adding to it refining it generally agreeing that it appeared viable They gathered their things as Caramon woke his brother Sturm and Eben pushed open the door leading to the hallway It appeared empty although they could hear faint sounds of harsh drunken laughter from a room directly across from them Draconians Silently the companions slipped into the dark and dingy corridor Tasselhoff stood in the middle of what he had named the Mechanism Room staring around the tunnel lighted dimly by the puffball The kender was beginning to feel discouraged It was a feeling he didnt get often and likened to the time hed eaten an entire green tomato pie acquired from a neighbor To this day discouragement and green tomato pie both made him want to throw up Theres got to be some way out of here said the kender Surely they inspect the mechanism occasionally or come up to admire it or give tours or something He and Fizban had spent an hour walking up and down the tunnel crawling in and out among the myriad chains They found nothing It was cold and barren and covered with dust Speaking of light said the old magician suddenly though they hadnt been Look there Tasselhoff looked A thin sliver of light was visible through a crack in the bottom of the wall near the entrance to the narrow tunnel They could hear voices and the light grew brighter as if torches were being lit in a room below them Maybe thats a way out the old man said Running lightly down the tunnel Tas knelt down and peered through the crack Come here The two looked down into a large room furnished with every possible luxury All that was beautiful graceful delicate or valuable in the lands under Verminaards control had been brought to decorate the private chambers of the Dragon Highlord An ornate throne stood at one end of the room Rare and priceless silver mirrors hung on the walls arranged so cunningly that no matter where a trembling captive turned the only image he saw was the grotesque horned helm of the Dragon Highlord glowering at him That must be him Tas whispered to Fizban That must be Lord Verminaard The kender sucked in his breath in awe That must be his dragonEmber The one Gilthanas told us about that killed all the elves in Solace Ember or Pyros his true name being a secret known only to draconians or to other dragonsnever to common mortals was an ancient and enormous red dragon Pyros had been given to Lord Verminaard ostensibly as a reward from the Queen of Darkness to her cleric In reality Pyros was sent to keep a watchful eye on Verminaard who had developed a strange paranoidal fear regarding discovery of the true gods All the Dragon Highlords on Krynn possessed dragons howeverthough perhaps not as strong and intelligent For Pyros had another more important mission that was secret even to the Dragon Highlord himselfa mission assigned to him by the Queen of Darkness and known only to her and her evil dragons Pyross mission was to search this part of Ansalon for one man a man of many names The Queen of Darkness called him Everman The dragons called him Green Gemstone Man His human name was Berem And it was because of this unceasing search for the human Berem that Pyros was present in Verminaards chamber this afternoon when he would have much preferred to be napping in his lair Pyros had received word that Fewmaster Toede was bringing in two prisoners for interrogation There was always the possibility this Berem might be one of them Therefore the dragon was always present during interrogations though he often appeared vastly bored The only time interrogations became interestingas far as Pyros was concernedwas when Verminaard ordered a prisoner to feed the dragon Pyros was stretched out along one side of the enormous throne room completely filling it His huge wings were folded at his sides his flanks heaved with every breath he took like some great gnomish engine Dozing he snorted and shifted slightly A rare vase toppled to the floor with a crash Verminaard looked up from his desk where he was studying a map of Qualinesti Transform yourself before you wreck the place he snarled Pyros opened one eye regarded Verminaard coldly for a moment then grudgingly rumbled a brief word of magic The gigantic red dragon began to shimmer like a mirage the monstrous dragon shape condensing into the shape of a human male slight of build with dark black hair a thin face and slanting red eyes Dressed in crimson robes Pyros the man walked to a desk near Verminaards throne Sitting down he folded his hands and stared at Verminaards broad muscled back with undisguised loathing There was a scratch at the door Enter Verminaard commanded absently A draconian guard threw open the door admitting Fewmaster Toede and his prisoners then withdrew swinging the great bronze and gold doors shut Verminaard kept the Fewmaster waiting several long minutes while he continued to study his battle plan Then favoring Toede with a condescending gaze he walked over and ascended the steps to his throne It was elaborately carved to resemble the gaping jaws of a dragon Verminaard was an imposing figure Tall and powerfully built he wore dark nightblue dragonscale armor trimmed in gold The hideous mask of a Dragon Highlord concealed his face Moving with a grace remarkable in such a large man he leaned back comfortably his leatherencased hand absently caressing a black goldtrimmed mace by his side Verminaard regarded Toede and his two captives irritably knowing full well that Toede had dredged up these two in an effort to redeem himself from the disastrous loss of the cleric When Verminaard discovered from his draconians that a woman matching the description of the cleric had been among those prisoners taken from Solace and that she had been allowed to escape his fury was terrifying Toede had nearly paid for his mistake with his life but the hobgoblin was exceptionally skilled at whining and groveling Knowing this Verminaard had considered refusing to admit Toede at all today but he had a strange nagging sensation that all was not well in his realm Its that blasted cleric Verminaard thought He could sense her power coming nearer and nearer making him nervous and uneasy He intently studied the two prisoners Toede led into the room Then seeing that neither of them matched the descriptions of those who had raided Xak Tsaroth Verminaard scowled behind the mask Pyros reacted differently to the sight of the prisoners The transformed dragon halfrose to his feet while his thin hands clenched the ebony desktop with such ferocity he left the impressions of his fingers in the wood Shaking with excitement it took a great effort of will to force himself to sit back down outwardly calm Only his eyes burning with a devouring flame gave a hint of his inner elation as he stared at the prisoners One of the prisoners was a gully dwarfSestun in fact He was chained hand and foot Toede was taking no chances and could barely walk Stumbling forward he dropped to his knees before the Dragon Highlord terrorstricken The other prisonerthe one Pyros watchedwas a human male dressed in rags who stood staring at the floor Why have you bothered me with these wretches Fewmaster Verminaard snarled Toede reduced to a quivering mass gulped and immediately launched into his speech This prisonerthe hobgoblin kicked Sestunwas the one who freed the slaves from Solace and this prisonerhe indicated the man who lifted his head a confused and puzzled expression on his facewas found wandering around Gateway which as you know has been declared off limits to all nonmilitary personnel So why bring them to me asked Lord Verminaard irritably Throw them into the mines with the rest of the rabble Toede stammered I thought the human mmmight bbe a sspy The Dragon Highlord studied the human intently He was tall about fifty human years old His hair was white and his cleanshaven face brown and weathered streaked with lines of age He was dressed like a beggar which is probably what he was Verminaard thought in disgust There was certainly nothing unusual about him except for his eyes which were bright and young His hands too were those of a man in his prime Probably elven blood The man is feebleminded Verminaard said finally Look at himgaping like a landed fish I bbbelieve hes uh deaf and dumb my lord Toede said sweating Verminaard wrinkled his nose Not even the dragonhelm could keep away the foul odor of perspiring hobgoblin So you have captured a gully dwarf and a spy who can neither hear nor speak Verminaard said caustically Well done Toede Perhaps now you can go out and pick me a bouquet of flowers If that is your lordships pleasure Toede replied solemnly bowing Verminaard began to laugh beneath his helm amused in spite of himself Toede was such a entertaining little creaturea pity he couldnt be taught to bathe Verminaard waved his hand Remove themand yourself What shall I do with the prisoners my lord Have the gully dwarf feed Ember tonight And take your spy to the mines Keep a watch on him thoughhe looks deadly The Dragon Highlord laughed Pyros ground his teeth and cursed Verminaard for a fool Toede bowed again Come on you he snarled yanking on the manacles and the man stumbled after him You too He prodded Sestun with his foot It was useless The gully dwarf hearing he was to feed the dragon had fainted A draconian was called to remove him Verminaard left his throne and walked over to his desk He gathered up his maps in a great roll Send the wyvern with dispatches he ordered Pyros We fly tomorrow morning to destroy Qualinesti Be ready when I call When the bronze and golden doors had closed behind the Dragon Highlord Pyros still in human form rose from the desk and began to pace feverishly back and forth across the room There came a scratching at the door Lord Verminaard has gone to his chambers Pyros called out irritated at the interruption The door opened a crack It is you I wish to see royal one whispered a draconian Enter Pyros said But be swift The traitor has been successful royal one the draconian said softly He was able to slip away only for a moment lest they suspect But he has brought the cleric To the Abyss with the cleric Pyros snarled This news is of interest only to Verminaard Take it to him No wait The dragon paused As you instructed I came to you first the draconian said apologetically preparing to make a hasty departure Dont go the dragon ordered raising a hand This news is of value to me after all Not the cleric There is much more at stake I must meet with our treacherous friend Bring him to me tonight in my lair Do not inform Lord Verminaardnot yet He might meddle Pryos was thinking rapidly now his plans coming together Verminaard has Qualinesti to keep him occupied As the draconian bowed and left the throne room Pyros began pacing once again back and forth back and forth rubbing his hands together smiling The parable of the gem Traitor revealed Tass dilemma top that you bold man Caramon simpered slapping Ebens hand as the fighter slyly slid his hand up Caramons skirt The women in the room laughed so heartily at the antics of the two warriors that Tanis glanced nervously at the cell door afraid of arousing the suspicion of the guards Maritta saw his worried gaze Dont worry about the guards she said with a shrug There are only two down here on this level and theyre drunk half the time especially now that the armys moved out She looked up from her sewing at the women and shook her head It does my heart good to hear them laugh poor things she said softly Theyve had little enough to laugh about these past days Thirtyfour women were crowded into one cellMaritta said there were sixty women living in another nearbyunder conditions so shocking that even the hardened campaigners were appalled Rude straw mats covered the floor The women had no possessions beyond a few clothes They were allowed outdoors for a brief exercise period each morning The rest of the time they were forced to sew draconian uniforms Though they had been imprisoned only a few weeks their faces were pale and wan their bodies thin and gaunt from the lack of nourishing food Tanis relaxed Though he had known Maritta only a few hours he already relied on her judgment She was the one who had calmed the terrified women when the companions burst into their cell She was the one who listened to their plan and agreed that it had possibilities Our menfolk will go along with you she told Tanis Its the Highseekers wholl give you trouble The Council of Highseekers Tanis asked in astonishment Theyre here Prisoners Maritta nodded frowning That was their payment for believing in that black cleric But they wont want to leave and why should they Theyre not forced to work in the mines the Dragon Highlord sees to that But were with you She glanced around at the others who nodded firmly On one conditionthat youll not put the children in danger I cant guarantee that Tanis said I dont mean to sound harsh but we may have to fight a dragon to reach them and Fight a dragon Flamestrike Maritta looked at him in amazement Pah Theres no need to fight the pitiful critter In fact were you to hurt her youd have half the children ready to tear you apart theyre that fond of her Of a dragon Goldmoon asked Whats she done cast a spell on them No I doubt Flamestrike could cast a spell on anything anymore Maritta smiled sadly The poor critters more than halfmad Her own children were killed in some great war or other and now shes got it in her head that our children are her children I dont know where his lordship dug her up but it was a sorry thing to do and I hope he pays for it someday She snapped a thread viciously Twont be difficult to free the children she added seeing Taniss worried look Flamestrike always sleeps late of a morning We feed the children their breakfast take them out for their exercise and she never stirs Shell never know theyre gone till she wakes poor thing The women filled with hope for the first time began modifying old clothes to fit the men Things went smoothly until it came time to fit them Shave Sturm roared in such fury that the women scurried away from the knight in alarm Sturm had taken a dim view of the disguise idea anyway but had agreed to go along with it It seemed the best way to cross the wideopen courtyard between the fortress and the mines But he announced he would rather die a hundred deaths at the hands of the Dragon Highlord than shave his moustaches He only calmed down when Tanis suggested covering his face with a scarf Just when that was settled another crisis arose Riverwind stated flatly that he would not dress up as a woman and no amount of arguing could convince him otherwise Goldmoon finally took Tanis aside to explain that in their tribe any warrior who committed a cowardly act in battle was forced to wear womens clothes until he redeemed himself Tanis was baffled by this one But Maritta had wondered how they would manage to outfit the tall man anyway After much discussion it was decided Riverwind would bundle up in a long cloak and walk hunched over leaning on a staff like an old woman Things went smoothly after thisfor a time at least Laurana walked over to a corner of the room where Tanis was wrapping a scarf around his own face Why dont you shave Laurana asked staring at Taniss beard Or do you truly enjoy flaunting your human side as Gilthanas says I dont flaunt it Tanis replied evenly I just got tired of trying to deny it thats all He drew a deep breath Laurana Im sorry I spoke to you as I did back in the SlaMori I had no right You had every right Laurana interrupted What I did was the act of a lovesick little girl I foolishly endangered your lives Her voice faltered then she regained control It will not happen again I will prove I can be of value to the group Exactly how she meant to do this she wasnt certain Although she talked glibly about being skilled in fighting she had never killed so much as a rabbit She was so frightened now that she was forced to clasp her hands behind her back to keep Tanis from seeing how she trembled She was afraid that if she let herself she would give way to her weakness and seek comfort in his arms so she left him and went over to help Gilthanas with his disguise Tanis told himself he was glad Laurana was showing some signs of maturity at last He steadfastly refused to admit that his soul stood breathless whenever he looked into her large luminous eyes The afternoon passed swiftly and soon it was evening and time for the women to take dinner to the mines The companions waited for the guards in tense silence laughter forgotten There had after all been one last crisis Raistlin coughing until he was exhausted said he was too weak to accompany them When his brother offered to stay behind with him Raistlin glared at him irritably and told him not to be a fool You do not need me this night the mage whispered Leave me alone I must sleep I dont like leaving him here Gilthanas began but before he could continue they heard the sound of clawed feet outside the cell and another sound of pots rattling The cell door swung open and two draconian guards both smelling strongly of stale wine stepped inside One of them reeled a bit as it peered blearyeyed at the women Get moving it said harshly As the women filed out they saw six gully dwarves standing in the corridor lugging large pots of some sort of nameless stew Caramon sniffed hungrily then wrinkled his nose in digust The draconians slammed the cell door shut behind them Glancing back Caramon saw his twin shrouded in blankets lying in a dark shadowy corner Fizban clapped his hands Well done my boy said the old magician in excitement as part of the wall in the Mechanism Room swung open Thanks Tas replied modestly Actually finding the secret door was more difficult than opening it I dont know how you managed I thought Id looked everywhere He started to crawl through the door then stopped as a thought occurred to him Fizban is there any way you can tell that light of yours to stay behind At least until we see if anyones in here Otherwise Im going to make an awfully good target and were not far from Verminaards chambers Im afraid not Fizban shook his head It doesnt like to be left alone in dark places Tasslehoff noddedhe had expected the answer Well there was no use worrying about it If the milks spilled the cat will drink it as his mother used to say Fortunately the narrow hallway he crawled into appeared empty The flame hovered near his shoulder He helped Fizban through then explored his surroundings They were in a small hallway that ended abruptly not forty feet away in a flight of stairs descending into darkness Double bronze doors in the east wall provided the only other exit Now muttered Tas were above the throne room Those stairs probably lead down to it I suppose theres a million draconians guarding it So thats out He put his ear to the door No sound Lets look around Pushing gently he easily opened the double doors Pausing to listen Tas entered cautiously followed closely by Fizban and the puffball flame Some sort of art gallery he said glancing around a giant room where paintings covered with dust and grime hung on the walls High slit windows in the walls gave Tas a glimpse of the stars and the tops of high mountains With a good idea of where he was now he drew a crude map in his head If my calculations are correct the throne room is to the west and the dragons lair is to the west of that At least thats where he went when Verminaard left this afternoon The dragon must have some way to fly out of this building so the lair should open up into the sky which means a shaft of some sort and maybe another crack where we can see whats going on So involved was Tas with his plans that he was not paying any attention to Fizban The old magician was moving purposefully around the room studying each painting as if searching for one in particular Ah here it is Fizban murmured then turned and whispered Tasslehoff The kender lifted his head and saw the painting suddenly begin to glow with a soft light Look at that Tasslehoff said entranced Why its a painting of dragonsred dragons like Emberattacking Pax Tharkas and The kenders voice died MenKnights of Solamniamounted on other dragons were fighting back The dragons the Knights rode were beautiful dragonsgold and silver dragonsand the men carried bright weapons that gleamed with a shining radiance Suddenly Tasslehoff understood There were good dragons in the worldif they could be foundwho would help fight the evil dragons and there was The Dragonlance he murmured The old magician nodded to himself Yes little one he whispered You understand You see the answer And you will remember But not now Not now Reaching out he ruffled the kenders hair with his gnarled hand Dragons What was I saying Tas couldnt remember And what was he doing here anyhow staring at a painting so covered with dust he couldnt make it out The kender shook his head Fizban must be rubbing off on him Oh yes The dragons lair If my calculations are correct its over here He walked away The old magician shuffled along behind smiling The companions journey to the mines proved uneventful They saw only a few draconian guards and they appeared halfasleep with boredom No one paid any attention to the women going by They passed the glowing forge continually fed by a scrambling mass of exhausted gully dwarves Hurrying past that dismal sight quickly the companions entered the mines where draconian guards locked the men in huge cave rooms at night then returned to keep an eye on the gully dwarves Guard duty over the men was a waste of time anyway Verminaard figuredthe humans werent going anyplace And for a while it looked to Tanis as if this might prove horribly true The men werent going anyplace They stared at Goldmoon unconvinced as she spoke After all she was a barbarianher accent was strange her dress even stranger She told what seemed a childrens tale of a dragon dying in a blue flame she herself survived And all she had to show for it was a collection of shining platinum disks Hederick the Solace Theocrat was loud in his denunciation of the Queshu woman as a witch and a charlatan and a blasphemer He reminded them of the scene in the Inn exhibiting his scarred hand as evidence Not that the men paid a great deal of attention to Hederick The Seeker gods after all had not kept the dragons from Solace Many of them in fact were interested in the prospect of escape Nearly all bore some mark of illtreatmentwhip lashes bruised faces They were poorly fed forced to live in conditions of filth and squalor and everyone knew that when the iron beneath the hills was gone their usefulness to Lord Verminaard would end But the Highseekersstill the governing body even in prisonopposed such a reckless plan Arguments started The men shouted back and forth Tanis hastily posted Caramon Flint Eben Sturm and Gilthanas at the doors fearing the guards would hear the disturbance and return The halfelf hadnt expected thisthe arguing might last for days Goldmoon sat despondently before the men looking as though she might cry She had been so imbued with her newfound convictions and so eager to bring her knowledge to the world that she was cast into despair when her beliefs were doubted These humans are fools Laurana said softly coming up to stand beside Tanis No replied Tanis sighing If they were fools it would be easier We promise them nothing tangible and ask them to risk the only thing they have lefttheir lives And for what To flee into the hills fighting a running battle all the way At least here they are alivefor the time being But how can life be worth anything living like this Laurana asked Thats a very good question young woman said a feeble voice They turned to see Maritta kneeling beside a man lying on a crude cot in a corner of the cell Wasted with illness and deprivation his age was indeterminable He struggled to sit up stretching out a thin pale hand to Tanis and Laurana His breath rattled in his chest Maritta tried to hush him but he stared at her irritably I know Im dying woman It doesnt mean I have to be bored to death first Bring that barbarian woman over to me Tanis looked at Maritta questioningly She rose and came over drawing him to one side He is Elistan she said as if Tanis should know the name When Tanis didnt respond she clarified Elistanone of the Highseekers from Haven He was much loved and respected by the people the only one who spoke out against this Lord Verminaard But no one listenednot wanting to hear of course You speak of him in the past tense Tanis said He isnt dead yet No but it wont be long Maritta wiped away a tear Ive seen the wasting sickness before My own father died of it Theres something inside of him eating him alive These last few days he has been halfmad with the pain but thats gone now The end is very near Maybe not Tanis smiled Goldmoon is a cleric She can heal him Perhaps perhaps not Maritta said skeptically I wouldnt want to chance it We shouldnt excite Elistan with false hope Let him die in peace Goldmoon Tanis said as the Chieftains Daughter came near This man wants to meet you Ignoring Maritta the halfelf led Goldmoon over to Elistan Goldmoons face hard and cold with disappointment and frustration softened as she saw the mans pitiful condition Elistan looked up at her Young woman he said sternly though his voice was weak you claim to bring word from ancient gods If it truly was we humans who turned from them not the gods who turned from us as weve always thought then why have they waited so long to make their presence known Goldmoon knelt down beside the dying man in silence thinking how to phrase her answer Finally she said Imagine you are walking through a wood carrying your most precious possessiona rare and beautiful gem Suddenly you are attacked by a vicious beast You drop the gem and run away When you realize the gem is lost you are afraid to go back into the woods and search for it Then someone comes along with another gem Deep in your heart you know it is not as valuable as the one you lost but you are still too frightened to go back to look for the other Now does this mean the gem has left the forest or is it still lying there shining brightly beneath the leaves waiting for you to return Elistan closed his eyes sighing his face filled with anguish Of course the gem waits for our return What fools we have been I wish I had time to learn of your gods he said reaching out his hand Goldmoon caught her breath her face drained until she was nearly as pale as the dying man on the cot You will be given time she said softly taking his hand in hers Tanis absorbed in the drama before him started in alarm when he felt a touch on his arm He turned around his hand on his sword to find Sturm and Caramon standing behind him What is it he asked swiftly The guards Not yet Sturm said harshly But we can expect them any minute Both Eben and Gilthanas are gone Night deepened over Pax Tharkas Back in his lair the red dragon Pyros had no room to pace a habit he had fallen into in his human form He barely had room to spread his wings in this chamber though it was the largest in the fortress and had even been expanded to accommodate him But the groundfloor chamber was so narrow all the dragon could do was turn his great body around Forcing himself to relax the dragon laid down upon the floor and waited his eyes on the door He didnt notice two heads peeking over the railing of a balcony on the third level far above him There was a scratch on the door Pyros raised his head in eager anticipation then dropped it again with a snarl as two goblins appeared dragging between them a wretched specimen Gully dwarf Pyros sneered speaking Common to underlings Verminaards taken leave of his senses if he thinks Id eat gully dwarf Toss him in a corner and get out he snarled at the goblins who hastened to do as instructed Sestun cowered in the corner whimpering Shut up Pyros ordered irritably Perhaps I should just flame you and stop that blubbering There came another sound at the door a soft knocking the dragon recognized His eyes burned red Enter A figure came into the lair of the dragon Dressed in a long cloak a hood covered its face I have come as you commanded Ember the figure said softly Yes Pyros replied his talons scratching the floor Remove the hood I would see the faces of those I deal with The man cast his hood back Up above the dragon on the third level came a strangled choking gasp Pyros stared up at the darkened balcony He considered flying up to investigate but the figure interrupted his thought I have only limited time royal one I must return before they suspect And I should report to Lord Verminaard In due course Pyros snapped irritably What are these fools that you accompany plotting They plan to free the slaves and lead them in revolt forcing Verminaard to recall the army marching on Qualinesti Thats all Yes royal one Now I must warn the Dragon Highlord Bah What does that matter It will be I who deal with the slaves if they revolt Unless they have plans for me No royal one They fear you a great deal as all must the figure added They will wait until you and Lord Verminaard have flown to Qualinesti Then they will free the children and escape into the mountains before you return That seems to be a plan equal to their intelligence Do not worry about Verminaard I will see he learns of this when I am ready for him to learn of it Much greater matters are brewing Much greater Now listen closely A prisoner was brought in today by that imbecile Toede Pyros paused his eyes glowing His voice dropped to a hissing whisper It is he The one we seek The figure stared in astonishment Are you certain Of course Pyros snarled viciously I see this man in my dreams He is herewithin my grasp When all of Krynn is searching for himI have found him You will inform Her Dark Majesty No I dare not trust a messenger I must deliver this man in person but I cannot leave now Verminaard cannot deal with Qualinesti alone Even if the war is just a ruse we must keep up appearances and the world will be better for the absence of elves anyway I will take the Everman to the Queen when time permits So why tell me the figure asked an edge in his voice Because you must keep him safe Pyros shifted his great bulk into a more comfortable position His plans were coming together rapidly now It is a measure of Her Dark Majestys power that the cleric of Mishakal and the man of the green gemstone arrive together within my reach I will allow Verminaard the pleasure of dealing with the cleric and her friends tomorrow In factPyross eyes gleamedthis may work out quite well We can remove the Green Gemstone Man in the confusion and Verminaard will know nothing When the slaves attack you must find the Green Gemstone Man Bring him back here and hide him in the lower chambers When the humans have all been destroyed and the army has wiped out Qualinesti I will deliver him to my Dark Queen I understand The figure bowed again And my reward Will be all you deserve Now leave me The man cast the hood up over his head and withdrew Pyros folded his wings and curling his great body around with the huge tail up over his snout he lay staring into the darkness The only sound that could be heard was Sestuns pitiful weeping Are you all right Fizban asked Tasslehoff gently as they sat crouched by the balcony afraid to move It was pitch dark Fizban having overturned a vase on the highly indignant puffball flame Yes Tas said dully Im sorry I choked like that I couldnt help myself Even though I expected itsort ofits still hard to realize someone you know could betray you Do you think the dragon heard me I couldnt say Fizban sighed The question is what do we do now I dont know Tas said miserably Im not supposed to be the one that thinks I just come along for the fun We cant warn Tanis and the others because we dont know where they are And if we start wandering around looking for them we might get caught and only make things worse He put his chin in his hand You know he said with unusual somberness I asked my father once why kenders were little why we werent big like humans and elves I really wanted to be big he said softly and for a moment he was quiet What did your father say asked Fizban gently He said kenders were small because we were meant to do small things If you look at all the big things in the world closely he said youll see that theyre really made up of small things all joined together That big dragon down there comes to nothing but tiny drops of blood maybe Its the small things that make the difference Very wise your father Yes Tas brushed his hand across his eyes I havent seen him in a long time The kenders pointed chin jutted forward his lips tightened His father if he had seen him would not have known this small resolute person for his son Well leave the big things to the others Tas announced finally Theyve got Tanis and Sturm and Goldmoon Theyll manage Well do the small thing even if it doesnt seem very important Were going to rescue Sestun Questions No answers Fizbans hat I heard something Tanis and I went to investigate Eben said his mouth set in a firm line I looked outside the cell door I was guarding and I saw a draconian crouched there listening I crept out and got it in a choke hold then a second one jumped me I knifed it then took off after the first I caught it and knocked it out then decided I better get back here The companions had returned to the cells to find both Gilthanas and Eben waiting for them Tanis had Maritta keep the women busy in a far corner while he questioned the two about their absence Ebens story appeared trueTanis had seen the bodies of the draconians as he returned to the prisonand Eben had certainly been in a fight His clothes were torn blood trickled from a cut on his cheek Tika got a relatively clean cloth from one of the women and began washing the cut He saved our lives Tanis she snapped Id think youd be grateful instead of glaring at him as if hed stabbed your best friend No Tika Eben said gently Tanis has a right to ask It did look suspicious I admit But I have nothing to hide Catching hold of her hand he kissed her fingertips Tika flushed and dipped the cloth in water raising it to his cheek again Caramon watching scowled What about you Gilthanas the warrior asked abruptly Why did you leave Do not question me the elf said sullenly You dont want to know Know what Tanis said sternly Why did you leave Leave him alone Laurana cried going to her brothers side Gilthanass almondeyes flashed as he glanced at them his face was drawn and pale This is important Laurana Tanis said Where did you go Gilthanas RememberI warned you Gilthanass eyes shifted to Raistlin I returned to see if our mage was really as exhausted as he said He must not have been He was gone Caramon stood up his fists clenched his face distorted with anger Sturm grabbed hold of him and shoved him backwards as Riverwind stepped in front of Gilthanas All have a right to speak and all have a right to respond in their own defense the Plainsman said in his deep voice The elf has spoken Let us hear from your brother Why should I speak Raistlin whispered harshly his voice soft and lethal with hatred None of you trusts me so why should you believe me I refuse to answer and you may think as you choose If you believe I am a traitorkill me now I will not stop you He began to cough Youll have to kill me too Caramon said in a choked voice He led his brother back to his bed Tanis felt sick Double watches all night No not you Eben Sturm you and Flint first Riverwind and Ill take second Tanis slumped down on the floor his head on his arms Weve been betrayed he thought One of those three is a traitor and has been all along The guards might come at any moment Or perhaps Verminaard was more subtle some trap to catch us all Then Tanis saw it all with sickening clarity Of course Verminaard would use the revolt as an excuse to kill the hostages and the cleric He could always get more slaves who would have a horrible example before their eyes of what happened to those who disobeyed him This planGilthanass planplayed right into his hands We should abandon it Tanis thought wildly then he forced himself to calm down No the people were too excited Following Elistans miraculous healing and his announced determination to study these ancient gods the people had hope They believed that the gods had truly come back to them But Tanis had seen the other Highseekers look at Elistan jealously He knew that though they made a show of supporting the new leader given time they would try and subvert him Perhaps even now they were moving among the people spreading doubt If we backed out now theyd never trust us again Tanis thought We must go aheadno matter how great the risk Besides perhaps he was wrong Maybe there was no traitor Hoping he fell into a fitful sleep The night passed in silence Dawn filtered through the gaping hole in the tower of the fortress Tas blinked then sat up rubbing his eyes wondering for a moment where he was Im in a big room he thought staring up at a high ceiling that had a hole cut in it to allow the dragon access to the outside There are two other doors besides the one Fizban and I came through last night Fizban The dragon Tas groaned remembering He hadnt meant to fall asleep He and Fizban had only been waiting until the dragon slept to rescue Sestun Now it was morning Perhaps it was too late Fearfully the kender crept to the balcony and peered over the edge No He sighed in relief The dragon was asleep Sestun slept too worn out with fear Now was their chance Tasslehoff crawled back to the mage Old One he whispered Wake up He shook him What Who Fire The mage sat up peering around blearily Where Run for the exits No not a fire Tas sighed Its morning Heres your hat He handed it to the magician who was groping around searching for it What happened to the puffball light Humpf Fizban sniffed I sent it back Kept me awake shining in my eyes We were supposed to stay awake remember Tas said in exasperation Rescue Sestun from the dragon How were we going to do that Fizban asked eagerly You were the one with the plan I was Dear dear The old magician blinked Was it a good one You didnt tell me Tas nearly shouted then he calmed down All you said was that we had to rescue Sestun before breakfast because gully dwarf might start looking more appetizing to a dragon who hadnt eaten in twelve hours Makes sense Fizban conceded Are you sure I said it Look said Tasslehoff patiently all we really need is a long rope to throw down to him Cant you magic that up Rope Fizban glared at him As if Id stoop so low That is an insult to one of my skill Help me stand Tas helped the mage stand I didnt mean to insult you the kender said and I know theres nothing fancy about rope and you are very skilled Its just thatoh all right Tas gestured toward the balcony Go ahead I just hope we all survive he muttered under his breath I wont let you downor Sestun either for that matter Fizban promised beaming The two peeked over the balcony Everything was as before Sestun lay in a corner The dragon slept soundly Fizban closed his eyes Concentrating he murmured eerie words then stretched his thin hand through the railing of the balcony and began to make a lifting motion Tasslehoff watching felt his heart fly up in his throat Stop he gurgled Youve got the wrong one Fizbans eyes flew open to see the red dragon Pyros slowly rising off the floor his body still curled in sleep Oh dear the magician gasped and quickly saying different words he reversed the spell lowering the dragon to the ground Missed my aim the mage said Now Im zeroed in Lets try again Tas heard the eerie words again This time Sestun began to rise off the floor and breath by breath came level with the balcony Fizbans face grew red with exertion Hes almost here Keep going Tas said hopping up and down in excitement Guided by Fizbans hand Sestun sailed peacefully over the balcony He came to rest on the dusty floor still asleep Sestun Tas whispered putting his hand over the gully dwarfs mouth so that he wouldnt yell Sestun Its me Tasslehoff Wake up The gully dwarf opened his eyes His first thought was that Verminaard had decided to feed him to a vicious kender instead of the dragon Then the gully dwarf recognized his friend and went limp with relief Youre safe but dont say a word the kender warned The dragon can still hear us He was interrupted by a loud booming from below The gully dwarf sat up in alarm Shhh said Tas probably just the door into the dragons lair He hurried back to the balcony where Fizban was peering through the railing What is it The Dragon Highlord Fizban pointed to the second level where Verminaard stood on a ledge overlooking the dragon Ember awaken Verminaard yelled down at the sleeping dragon I have received reports of intruders That cleric is here inciting the slaves to rebellion Pyros stirred and slowly opened his eyes awakening from a disturbing dream in which hed seen a gully dwarf fly Shaking his giant head to clear away the sleep he heard Verminaard ranting about clerics He yawned So the Dragon Highlord had found out the cleric was in the fortress Pyros supposed hed have to deal with this now after all Do not trouble yourself my lord Pyros began then stopped abruptly staring at something very strange Trouble myself Verminaard fumed Why I He stopped too The object at which both stared was drifting down through the air gently as a feather Fizbans hat Tanis woke everyone in the darkest hour before dawn Well said Sturm do we go ahead We have no choice Tanis said grimly looking at the group If one of you has betrayed us then he must live with the knowledge that he has brought about the deaths of innocents Verminaard will kill not only us but the hostages as well I pray that there is no traitor and so Im going ahead with our plans No one said anything but each glanced sideways at the others suspicion gnawing at all of them When the women were awake Tanis went over the plan again My friends and I will sneak up to the childrens room with Maritta disguised as the women who usually bring the children breakfast Well lead them to the courtyard Tanis said quietly You must go about your business as you do every morning When you are allowed into the exercise area get the children and start moving immediately toward the mines Your menfolk will handle the guards there and you can escape safely into the mountains to the south Do you understand The women nodded silently as they heard the sound of the guards approaching This is it Tanis said softly Back to your work The women scattered Tanis beckoned to Tika and Laurana If we have been betrayed you will both be in great danger since youll be guarding the women he began Well all be in great danger Laurana amended coldly She hadnt slept all night She knew that if she released the tight bands she had wrapped around her soul fear would overwhelm her Tanis saw none of this inner turmoil He thought she appeared unusually pale and exceptionally beautiful this morning A longtime campaigner himself his preoccupation made him forget the terrors of a first battle Clearing his throat he said huskily Tika take my advice Keep your sword in your scabbard Youre less dangerous that way Tika giggled and nodded nervously Go say goodbye to Caramon Tanis told her Tika blushed crimson and giving Tanis and Laurana a meaningful look ran off Tanis gazed at Laurana steadily for a moment andfor the first timesaw that her jaw muscles were clenched so tightly the tendons in her neck were stretched He reached out to hold her but she was stiff and cold as a draconians corpse You dont have to do this Tanis said releasing her This isnt your fight Go to the mines with the other women Laurana shook her head waiting to speak until she was certain her voice was under control Tika is not trained for fighting I am No matter if it was ceremonial She smiled bitterly at Taniss look of discomfiture I will do my part Tanis His human name came awkwardly to her lips Otherwise you might think I am a traitor Laurana please believe me Tanis sighed I dont think Gilthanas is a traitor any more than you do Its justdamn it there are so many lives at stake Laurana Cant you realize Feeling his hands on her arms shake she looked up at him and saw the anguish and the fear in his own facemirroring the fear she felt inside Only his was not fear for himself it was fear for others She drew a deep breath I am sorry Tanis she said You are right Look The guards are here It is time to go She turned and walked away without looking back It didnt occur to her until it was too late that Tanis might have been silently asking for comfort himself Maritta and Goldmoon led the companions up a flight of narrow stairs to the first level The draconian guards didnt accompany them saying something about special duty Tanis asked Maritta if that was usual and she shook her head her face worried They had no choice but to go on Six gully dwarves trailed after them carrying heavy pots of what smelled like oatmeal They paid little attention to the women until Caramon stumbled over his skirt climbing the stairs and fell to his knees uttering a very unladylike oath The gully dwarves eyes opened wide Dont even squeak Flint said whirling around to face them a knife flashing in his hand The gully dwarves cowered against the wall shaking their heads frantically the pots clattering The companions reached the top of the stairs and stopped We cross this hall to the door Maritta pointed Oh no She grasped Taniss arm Theres a guard at the door Its never guarded Hush it could be coincidence Tanis said reassuringly although he knew it wasnt Just keep on as we planned Maritta nodded fearfully and walked across the hall Guards Tanis turned to Sturm Be ready Remember quick and deadly No noise According to Gilthanass map the playroom was separated from the childrens sleeping quarters by two rooms The first was a storeroom which Maritta reported was lined with shelves containing toys and clothing and other items A tunnel ran through this room to the secondthe room that housed the dragon Flamestrike Poor thing Maritta had said when discussing the plan with Tanis She is as much a prisoner as we are The Dragon Highlord never allows her out I think theyre afraid shell wander off Theyve even built a tunnel through the storeroom too small for her to fit through Not that she wants to get out but I think she might like to watch the children play Tanis regarded Maritta dubiously wondering if they might encounter a dragon very different from the mad feeble creature she described Beyond the dragons lair was the room where the children slept This was the room they would have to enter to wake the children and lead them outdoors The playroom connected directly with the courtyard through a huge door locked with a great oaken beam More to keep the dragon in than us Maritta stated It must be just about dawning Tanis thought as they emerged from the stairwell and turned toward the playroom The torchlight cast their shadows ahead of them Pax Tharkas was quiet deathly quiet Too quietfor a fortress preparing for war Four draconian guards stood huddled together talking at the doorway to the playroom Their conversation broke off as they saw the women approach Goldmoon and Maritta walked in front Goldmoons hoodwas drawn back her hair glimmering in the torchlight Directly behind Goldmoon came Riverwind Bent over a staff the Plainsman was practically walking on his knees Caramon and Raistlin followed the mage staying close to his brother then Eben and Gilthanas All the traitors together as Raistlin had sarcastically observed Flint brought up the rear turning occasionally to glower at the panicstricken gully dwarves Youre early this morning a draconian growled The women clustered like chickens in a halfcircle around the guards and stood waiting patiently to be allowed inside It smells of thunder Maritta said sharply I want the children to have their exercise before the storm hits And what are you doing here This door is never guarded Youll frighten the children One of the draconians made some comment in their harsh language and two of the others grinned showing rows of pointed teeth The spokesman only snarled Lord Verminaards command He and Ember are gone this morning to finish the elves Were ordered to search you before you enter The draconians eyes fastened onto Goldmoon hungrily Thats going to be a pleasure Id say For you maybe muttered another guard staring at Sturm in disgust Ive never seen an uglier female in my life than ugh The creature slumped over a dagger thrust deep into its ribs The other three draconians died within seconds Caramon wrapped his hands around the neck of one Eben hit his in the stomach and Flint lobbed off its head with an axe as it fell Tanis stabbed the leader through the heart with his sword He started to let go of the weapon expecting it to remain stuck in the creatures stony corpse To his amazement his new sword slid out of the stone carcass as easily as if it had been nothing more than goblin flesh He had no time to ponder this strange occurrence The gully dwarves catching sight of the flash of steel dropped their pots and ran wildly down the corridor Never mind them Tanis snapped at Flint Into the playroom Hurry Stepping over the bodies he flung the door open If anyone finds these bodies itll be all over Caramon said It was over before we began Sturm muttered angrily Weve been betrayed so its just a matter of time Keep moving Tanis said sharply shutting the door behind them Be very quiet Maritta whispered Flamestrike generally sleeps soundly If she does waken act like women Shell never recognize you Shes blind in one eye The chill dawn light filtered in through tiny windows high above the floor shining on a grim cheerless playroom A few wellused toys lay scattered about There was no furniture Caramon walked over to inspect the huge wooden beam barring the double doors that led to the courtyard outside I can manage he said The big man appeared to lift the beam effortlessly then set it against the wall and shoved on the door Not locked from the outside he reported I guess they didnt expect us to get this far Or perhaps Lord Verminaard wants us out there Tanis thought He wondered if what the draconian said was true Had the Dragon Highlord and the dragon really gone Or were theyangrily he wrenched his mind back It doesnt matter he told himself We have no choice We must go on Flint stay here he said If anyone comes warn us first then fight Flint nodded and took a position just inside the door leading to the corridor first opening it a crack to see The draconian bodies had turned to dust on the floor Maritta took a torch from the wall Lighting it she led the companions through a dark archway into the tunnel leading to the dragons lair Fizban Your hat Tas risked whispering Too late The old magician made a grab for it but missed Spies yelled Verminaard in a rage pointing up to the balcony Capture them Ember I want them alive Alive the dragon repeated to himself No that could not be Pyros recalled the strange sound he had heard last night and he knew without a doubt that these spies had overheard him talking about the Green Gemstone Man Only a privileged few knew that dread secret the great secret the secret that would conquer the world for the Queen of Darkness These spies must die and the secret die with them Pyros spread his wings and launched himself into the air using his powerful back legs to propel himself from the floor with tremendous speed This is it thought Tasslehoff Now weve done it Theres no escape this time Just as he resigned himself to being cooked by a dragon he heard the magician shout a single word of command and a thick unnatural darkness almost knocked the kender over Run panted Fizban grabbing the kenders hand and dragging Tas to his feet Sestun Ive got him Run Tasslehoff ran They flew out the door and into the gallery then he had no idea where he was going He just kept hold of the old man and ran Behind him he could hear the sound of the dragon whooshing up out of his lair and he heard the dragons voice So you are a magicuser are you spy Pyros shouted We cant have you running around in the dark You might get lost Let me light your way Tasslehoff heard a great intake of breath into a giant body then flames crackled and burned around him The darkness vanished driven away by the fires flaring light but to his amazement Tas wasnt touched by the flame He looked at Fizban hatless running next to him They were in the gallery still heading for the double doors The kender twisted his head Behind him loomed the dragon more horrible than anything he had imagined more terrifying than the black dragon in Xak Tsaroth The dragon breathed on them again and once more Tas was enveloped by flame The paintings on the walls blazed furniture burned curtains flared like torches smoke filled the room But none of it touched him and Sestun and Fizban Tasslehoff looked at the mage in admiration truly impressed How long can you keep this up he shouted to Fizban as they wheeled around a corner the double bronze doors in sight The old mans eyes were wide and staring I have no idea he gasped I didnt know I could do it at all Another blast of flame exploded around them This time Tasslehoff felt the heat and glanced at Fizban in alarm The mage nodded Im losing it he cried Hang on Tasslehoff panted Were almost to the door He cant get through it The three pushed through the bronze double doors that led from the gallery back into the hallway just as Fizbans magic spell wore off Before them was the secret door still open that led to the Mechanism Room Tasslehoff flung the bronze doors shut and stopped a moment to catch his breath But just as he was about to say We made it one of the dragons huge clawed feet broke through the stone wall right above the kenders head Sestun giving a shriek headed for the stairs No Tasslehoff grabbed him That leads to Verminaards quarters Back to the Mechanism Room Fizban cried They dashed through the secret door just as the stone wall gave way with a tremendous crash But they could not shut the door I have a lot to learn about dragons apparently Tas muttered I wonder if there are any good books on the subject So I have run you rats into your hole and now you are trapped boomed Pyross voice from outside You have nowhere to go and stone walls do not stop me There was a terrible grinding and grating sound The walls of the Mechanism Room trembled then began to crack It was a nice try Tas said ruefully That last spell was a doozy Almost worth getting killed by a dragon to see Killed Fizban seemed to wake up By a dragon I should say not Ive never been so insulted There must be a way out His eyes began to gleam Down the chain The chain repeated Tas thinking he must have misunderstood what with the walls cracking around him and the dragon roaring and all Well crawl down the chain Come on Cackling with delight the old mage turned and ran down the tunnel Sestun looked dubiously at Tasslehoff but just then the dragons huge claw appeared through the wall The kender and the gully dwarf turned and ran after the old magician By the time they reached the great wheel Fizban had already crawled along the chain leading from the tunnel and reached the first treetrunk tooth of the wheel itself Tucking his robes up around his thighs he dropped down from the tooth onto the first rung of the huge chain The kender and gully dwarf swung onto the chain after him Tas was just beginning to think they might get out of this alive after all especially if the dark elf at the bottom of the chain had taken the day off when Pyros burst suddenly into the shaft where the great chain hung Sections of the stone tunnel caved in around them falling to the ground with a hollow booming thud The walls shuddered and the chain started to tremble Above them hovered the dragon He did not speak but simply stared at them with his red eyes Then he drew in a huge breath that seemed to suck in the air of the whole valley Tas started instinctively to close his eyes then opened them wide Hed never seen a dragon breathe fire and he wasnt going to miss seeing it nowespecially as it would probably be his last chance Flames billowed out from the dragons nose and mouth The blast from the heat alone nearly knocked Tasslehoff off the chain But once again the fire burned all around him and did not touch him Fizban cackled with delight Quite clever old man said the dragon angrily But I too am a magicuser and I feel you weakening I hope your cleverness amuses youall the way down Flames flared out again but this time the dragons fire was not aimed at the trembling figures clinging to the chain The flames struck the chain itself and the iron links began to glow red hot at the first touch of the dragonfire Pyros breathed again and the links burned white hot The dragon breathed a third time The links melted The massive chain gave a great shudder and broke plunging into the darkness below Pyros watched it as it plummeted down Then satisfied that the spies would not live to tell their tale he flew back to his lair where he could hear Verminaard shouting for him In the darkness left behind by the dragon the great cogwheelfree of the chain that had held it in place for centuriesgave a groan and began to turn Matafleur The magic sword White feathers The light from Marittas torch illuminated a large barren windowless room There was no furniture The only objects in the chill stone chamber were a huge basin of water a bucket filled with what smelled like rotted meat and a dragon Tanis caught his breath He had thought the black dragon in Xak Tsaroth formidable He was truly awed at the massive size of this red dragon Her lair was enormous probably over one hundred feet in diameter and the dragon stretched the length of it the tip of her long tail lying against the far wall For a moment the companions stood stunned with ghastly visions of the giant head rising up and searing them with the burning flame breathed by the red dragons the flames that had destroyed Solace Maritta did not appear worried however She advanced steadily into the room and after a moments hesitation the companions hurried after her As they drew closer to the creature they could see that Maritta had been rightthe dragon was clearly in pitiful condition The great head that lay on the cold stone floor was lined and wrinkled with age the brilliant red skin grayish and mottled She breathed noisily through her mouth her jaws parted to reveal the once swordsharp teeth now yellowed and broken Long scars ran along her sides her leathery wings were dry and cracked Now Tanis could understand Marittas attitude Clearly the dragon had been illused and he caught himself feeling pity relaxing his guard He realized how dangerous this was when the dragonawakened by the torchlightstirred in her sleep Her talons were as sharp and her fire as destructive as any other red dragon in Krynn Tanis reminded himself sharply The dragons eyes opened slits of glistening red in the torchlight The companions halted hands on their weapons Is it time for breakfast already Maritta Matafleur Flamestrike being her name to common mortals said in a sleepy husky voice Yes were just a bit early today dearie Maritta said soothingly But theres a storm brewing and I want the children to have their exercise before it breaks Go back to sleep Ill see they dont wake you on their way out I dont mind The dragon yawned and opened her eyes a bit farther Now Tanis could see that one of them had a milky covering she was blind in that eye I hope we dont have to fight her Tanis Sturm whispered Itd be like fighting someones grandmother Tanis forced his expression to harden Shes a deadly grandmother Sturm Just remember that The little ones had a restful night the dragon murmured apparently drifting off to sleep again See that they dont get wet if it does storm Maritta Especially little Erik He had a cold last week Her eyes closed Turning Maritta beckoned the others on putting her finger to her lips Sturm and Tanis came last their weapons and armor muffled by numerous cloaks and skirts Tanis was about thirty feet from the dragons head when the noise started At first he thought it was his imagination that his nervousness was making him hear a buzzing sound in his head But the sound grew louder and louder and Sturm turned staring at him in alarm The buzzing sound increased until it was like a thousand swarming locusts Now the others were looking back tooall of them staring at him Tanis looked at his friends helplessly an almost comic look of confusion on his face The dragon snorted and stirred in irritation shaking her head as though the noise hurt her ears Suddenly Raistlin broke from the group and ran back to Tanis The sword he hissed He grabbed the halfelfs cloak and threw it back to reveal the blade Tanis stared down at the sword in its antique scabbard The mage was right The blade hummed as if in the highest state of alarm Now that Raistlin called his attention to it the halfelf could actually feel the vibrations Magic the mage said softly studying it with interest Can you stop it yelled Tanis over the weird noise No said Raistlin I remember now This is Wyrmslayer the famed magical sword of KithKanan It is reacting to the presence of the dragon This is an abysmal time to remember Tanis said in fury Or a very convenient time snarled Sturm The dragon slowly raised her head her eyes blinking a thin stream of smoke drifting from a nostril She focused her bleary red eyes on Tanis pain and irritation in her gaze Who have you brought Maritta Matafleurs voice was filled with menace I hear a sound I have not heard in centuries I smell the foul smell of steel These are not the women These are warriors Dont hurt her Maritta wailed I may not have any choice Tanis said viciously drawing Wyrmslayer from its sheath Riverwind and Goldmoon get Maritta out of here The blade began to shine with a brilliant white light as the buzzing grew louder and angrier Matafleur shrank back The light of the sword pierced her good eye painfully the terrible sound went through her head like a spear Whimpering she huddled away from Tanis Run get the children Tanis yelled realizing that they didnt need to fightat least not yet Holding the shining sword high in the air he moved forward cautiously driving the pitiful dragon back against the wall Maritta after one fearful glance at Tanis led Goldmoon tothe childrens room About one hundred children were wideeyed with alarm over the strange sounds outside their chamber Their faces relaxed at the sight of Maritta and Goldmoon and a few of the littler ones actually giggled when Caramon came rushing in his skirts flapping around his armored legs But at the sight of warriors and their drawn weapons the children sobered immediately What is it Maritta asked the oldest girl Whats happening Is it fighting again We hope therell be no fighting dear one Maritta said softly But Ill not lie to youit may come to that Now I want you to gather your things particularly your warm cloaks and come with us The older of you carry the wee ones as you do when we go outdoors for exercise Sturm expected confusion and wailing and demands for explanations But the children quickly did as they were told wrapping themselves in warm clothing and helping to dress the younger ones They were quiet and calm if a bit pale These were children of war Sturm remembered I want you to move very swiftly through the dragons lair and out into the playroom When we get there the big man Sturm gestured to Caramonwill lead you out into the courtyard Your mothers are waiting for you there When you get outside look immediately for your mother and go to her Does everyone understand He glanced dubiously at the smaller children but the girl at the front of the line nodded We understand sir she said All right Sturm turned Caramon The warrior flushing in embarrassment as one hundred pairs of eyes turned to look at him led the way back into the dragons lair Goldmoon scooped up a toddler in her arms Maritta picked up another one The older boys and girls carried little ones on their backs They hurried out the door in orderly fashion without saying a word until they saw Tanis the gleaming sword and the terrified dragon Hey you Dont hurt our dragon one little boy yelled Leaving his place in line the child ran up to Tanis his fists raised his face twisted into a snarl Dougl cried the oldest girl shocked Get back in line this instant But some of the children were crying now Tanis the sword still raisedknowing that this was the only thing keeping the dragon at bayshouted Get them out of here Children please Chieftains Daughter her voice stern and commanding brought order to the chaos Tanis will not hurt the dragon if he does not have to He is a gentle man You must leave now Your mothers need you There was an edge of fear in Goldmoons voice a feeling of urgency that influenced even the youngest child They got back into line quickly Goodbye Flamestrike several of the children called out wistfully waving their hands as they followed Caramon Dougl gave Tanis one final threatening glance then he returned to line wiping his eyes with grubby fists No shrieked Matafleur in a heartbroken voice No Dont fight my children Please It is me you want Fight me Dont harm my children Tanis realized the dragon was back in her past reliving whatever terrible event had deprived her of her children Sturm stayed near Tanis Shes going to kill you when the children are out of danger you know Yes said Tanis grimly Already the dragons eyeseven the bad eyewere flaring red Saliva dripped from the great gaping mouth and her talons scratched the floor Not my children she said with rage Im with you Sturm began drawing his sword Leave us knight Raistlin whispered softly from the shadows Your weapon is useless I will stay with Tanis The halfelf glanced at the mage in astonishment Raistlins strange golden eyes met his knowing what he was thinking do I trust him Raistlin gave him no help almost as if he were goading him to refusal Get out Tanis said to Sturm What he yelled Are you crazy Youre trusting this Get out Tanis repeated At that moment he heard Flint yelling loudly Go Sturm they need you out there The knight stood a moment irresolute but he could not in honor ignore a direct order from one he considered his commander Casting a baleful glance at Raistlin Sturm turned on his heel and entered the tunnel There is little magic I can work against a red dragon Raistlin whispered swiftly Can you buy us time Tanis asked Raistlin smiled the smile of one who knows death is so near it is past fearing I can he whispered Move back near the tunnel When you hear me start to speak run Tanis began backing up still holding the sword high But the dragon no longer feared its magic She knew only that her children were gone and she must kill those responsible She lunged directly at the warrior with the sword as he began to run toward the tunnel Then darkness descended upon her a darkness so deep Matafleur thought for a horrible moment she had lost the sight of the other eye She heard whispered words of magic and knew the robed human had cast a spell Ill burn them she howled sniffing the smell of steel through the tunnel They will not escape But just as she sucked in a great breath she heard another soundthe sound of her children No she realized in frustration I dare not My children I might harm my children Her head drooped down on the cold stone floor Tanis and Raistlin ran down the tunnel the halfelf dragging the weakened mage with him Behind them they heard a pitiful heartbroken moan Not my children Please fight me Dont hurt my children Tanis emerged from the tunnel into the playroom blinking in the bright light as Caramon swung the huge doors open to the rising sun The children raced out the door into the courtyard Through the door Tanis could see Tika and Laurana standing with their swords drawn looking their way anxsiously A draconian lay crumbling on the floor of the playroom Flints battleaxe stuck in its back Outside all of you Tanis shouted Flint retrieving his battleaxe joined the halfelf as the last to leave the playroom As they did so they heard a terrifying roar the roar of a dragon but a very different dragon than the pitiful Matafleur Pyros had discovered the spies The stone walls began to tremblethe dragon was rising from his lair Ember Tanis swore bitterly He hasnt gone The dwarf shook his head Ill bet my beard he said gloomily that Tasslehoffs involved The broken chain plummeted to the stone floor of the Chain Room in the SlaMori three little figures falling with it Tasslehoff clinging uselessly to the chain tumbled through the darkness and thought this is how it feels to die It was an interesting sensation and he was sorry he couldnt experience it longer Above him he could hear Sestun shrieking in terror Below he heard the old mage muttering to himself probably trying one last spell Then Fizban raised his voice Pveatherf The word was cut off with a scream There was the sound of a bonecrushing thud as the old magician crashed to the floor Tasslehoff grieved even though he knew he was next The stone floor was approaching Within a very few seconds he too would be dead Then it was snowing At least that was what the kender thought Then he realized with a shock that he was surrounded by millions and millions of featherslike an explosion of chickens He sank into a deep vast pile of white feathers Sestun tumbling in after him Poor Fizban Tas said blinking tears from his eyes as he floundered in an ocean of white chicken feathers His last spell must have been featherfall like Raistlin uses Wouldnt you know it He just got the feathers Above him the cogwheel turned faster and faster the freed chain rushing through it as if rejoicing in its release from bondge Outdoors in the courtyard chaos reigned Over here Tanis yelled bursting out of the door knowing they were doomed but refusing to give in The companions gathered around him weapons drawn looking at him anxiously Run to the mines Run for shelter Verminaard and the red dragon didnt leave It is a trap Theyll be on us any moment The others their faces grim nodded All of them knew it was hopelessthey must cover about two hundred yards of flat wideopen surface to reach safety They tried to herd the women and children along as swiftly as possible but not very successfully All the mothers and children needed to be sorted out Then Tanis looking over at the mines swore aloud in added frustration The men of the mines seeing their families free quickly overpowered the guards and began running toward the courtyard That wasnt the plan What was Elistan thinking about Within moments there would be eight hundred frantic people milling around out in the open without a scrap of shelter He had to get them to head back south to the mountains Wheres Eben he called to Sturm Last I saw him he was running for the mines I couldnt figure out why The knight and halfelf gasped in sudden realization Of course said Tanis softly his voice lost in the commotion It all fits As Eben ran for the mines his one thought was to obey Pyross command Somehow in the midst of this furor he had to find the Green Gemstone Man He knew what Verminaard and Pyros were going to do to these poor wretches Eben felt amoments pityhe was not after all cruel and vicious He had amply seen long ago which side was bound to win and he determined for once to be on a winning side When his familys fortune was wiped out Eben was left with only one thing to sellhimself He was intelligent handy with a sword and as loyal as money could buy It was on a journey to north looking for possible buyers that Eben met Vermiaard Eben had been impressed with Verminaards power and had wormed his way into the evil clerics favor But more importantly he had managed to make himself useful to Pyros The dragon found Eben charming intelligent resourceful and after a few teststrustworthy Eben was sent home to Gateway just before the dragonarmies struck He conveniently escaped and started his resistance group Stumbling upon Gilthanass party of elves the first time they tried to sneak into Pax Tharkas was a stroke of luck that further improved Ebens relationship with both Pyros and Verminaard When the cleric actually fell into Ebens hands he couldnt believe his luck It must go to show how much the Dark Queen favored him he supposed He prayed that the Dark Queen continue to favor him Finding the Green Gemstone Man in this confusion was going to take divine intervention Hundreds of men were milling about uncertainly Eben saw a chance to do Verminaard another favor Tanis wants you men to meet in the courtyard he cried Join your families No That isnt the plan Elistan cried trying to stop them But he was too late The men seeing their families free surged forward Several hundred gully dwarves added to the confusion rushing gleefully out of the mines to join the fun thinking perhaps it was a holiday Eben scanned the crowd anxiously for the Green Gemstone Man then dedded to look inside the prison cells Sure enough he found the man sitting alone staring vaguely around the empty cell Eben swiftly knelt beside him racking his brain to come up with the mans name It was something odd oldfashioned Berem Eben said after a moment Berem The man looked up interest lighting his face for the first time in many weeks He was not as Toede had assumed deaf and dumb He was instead a man obsessed totally absorbed in his own secret quest He was human however and the sound of a human voice speaking his name was inordinately comforting Berem said Eben again licking his lips nervously Now that he had him he wasnt sure what to do with him He knew the first thing those poor wretches outside would do when the dragon struck would be to head for the safety of the mines He had to get Berem out of here before Tanis caught them But where He could take the man inside Pax Tharkas as Pyros had ordered but Eben didnt like that idea Verminaard would certainly find them and his suspicions aroused would ask questions Eben couldnt answer No there was only one place Eben could take him and be safeoutside the walls of Pax Tharkas They could lie low in the wilderness until the confusion died then sneak back inside the fortress at night His decision made Eben took Berems arm and helped the man rise to his feet Theres going to be fighting he said Im going to take you away keep you safe until it is over I am your friend Do you understand The man regarded him with a look of penetrating wisdom and intelligence It was not the ageless look of the elves but of a human who has lived in torment for countless years Berem gave a small sigh and nodded Verminaard strode from his chamber in a fury yanking at his leather armored gloves A draconian trotted behind carrying the Highlords mace Nightbringer Other draconians milled around acting on the orders Verminaard gave as he stepped into the corridor returning to Pyross lair No you fools dont recall the army This will take but a moment of my time Qualinesti will be in flames by nightfall Ember he shouted throwing open the doors that led to the dragons lair He stepped out onto the ledge Peering upward toward the balcony he could see smoke and flame and in the distance hear the dragons roar Ember There was no answer How long does it take to capture a handful of spies he demanded furiously Turning he nearly fell over a draconian captain Will you be using the dragonsaddle my lord No there isnt time Besides I use that only for combat and there will no one to fight out there simply a few hundred slaves to burn But the slaves have overcome the guards at the mine and are rejoining their families in the courtyard How strong are your forces Not nearly strong enough my lord the draconian captain said its eyes glinting The captain had never thought it wise to deplete the garrison We are forty or fifty perhaps to over three hundred men and an equal number of women The women will undoubtedly fight alongside the men your lordship and if they never get organized and escape into the mountains Bah Ember Verminaard called He heard in another part of the fortress a heavy metallic thud Then he heard another sound the great wheelunused in centuriescreaking with protest at being forced into labor Verminaard was wondering what these odd sounds portended when Pyros flew down into his lair The Dragon Highlord ran to the ledge as Pyros dropped past him Verminaard climbed swiftly and skillfully onto the dragons back Though separated by mutual distrust the two fought well together Their hatred for the petty races they strove to conquer combined with their desire for power joined them in a bond much stronger than either cared to admit Fly Verminaard roared and Pyros rose into the air It is useless my friend Tanis said quietly to Sturm laying his hand on the knights shoulder as Sturm frantically called for order Youre only wasting your breath Save it for fighting Therell be no fighting Sturm coughed hoarse from shouting Well die trapped like rats Why wont these fools listen He and Tanis stood at the northern end of the courtyard about twenty feet from the front gates of Pax Tharkas Looking south they could see the mountains and hope Behind them were the great gates of the fortress that would at any moment open to admit the vast draconian army and within these walls somewhere were Verminaard and the red dragon In vain Elistan sought to calm the people and urge them to move southwards But the men insisted on finding their womenfolk the women on finding their children A few families together again were starting to move south but too late and too slowly Then like a bloodred flaming comet Pyros soared from the fortress of Pax Tharkas his wings sleek held close to his sides His huge tail trailed behind him His taloned forefeet were curled close to his body as he gained speed in the air Upon his back rode the Dragon Highlord the gilded horns of the hideous dragonmask glinting in the morning sun Verminaard held onto the dragons spiny mane with both hands as they flared into the sunlit sky bringing nights shadows to the courtyard below The dragonfear spread over the people Unable to scream or run they could only cower before the fearful apparition arms around each other knowing death was inevitable At Verminaards command Pyros settled on one of the fortress towers Verminaard stared out from behind the homed dragonmask silent furious Tanis watching in helpless frustration felt Sturm grip his arm Look The knight pointed north toward the gates Tanis reluctantly Ipwered his gaze from the Dragon Highlord and saw two figures running toward the gates of the fortress Eben he cried in disbelief But whos that with him He wont escape Sturm shouted Before Tanis could stop him the knight ran after the two As Tanis followed he saw a flash of red out of the comer of his eyeRaistlin and his twin I too have a score to settle with this man the mage hissed The three caught up with Sturm just as the knight gripped Eben by the collar and hurled him to the ground Traitor Sturm yelled loudly Though I die this day Ill send you to the Abyss first He drew his sword and jerked Ebens head back Suddenly Ebens companion whirled around came back and caught hold of Sturms swordarm Sturm gasped His hand loosened its grip on Eben as the knight stared amazed at the sight before him The mans shirt had been torn open in his wild flight from the mines Impaled in the mans flesh in the center of his chest was a brilliant green jewel Sunlight flashed on the gem that was as big around as a mans fist causing it to gleam with a bright and terrible lightan unholy light I have never seen nor heard of magic like this Raistlin whispered in awe as he and the others stopped stunned beside Sturm Seeing their wide eyes focused on his body Berem instinctively pulled his shirt over his chest Then loosening his hold on Sturms arm he turned and ran for the gates Eben scrambled to his feet and stumbled after him Sturm leaped forward but Tanis stopped him No he said Its too late We have others to think of Tanis look Caramon shouted pointing above the huge gates A section of the stone wall of the fortress above the massive front gates began to open forming a huge widening crack Slowly at first then with increasing speed the massive granite boulders began to fall from the crack smashing to the ground with such force that the flagstone cracked and great clouds of dust rose into the air Above the roar could be dimly heard the sound of the massive chains releasing the mechanism The boulders began to fall just as Eben and Berem arrived at the gates Eben shrieked in terror instinctively and pitifully raised his arm to shield his head The man next to him glanced up andit seemedgave a small sigh Then both were buried under tons of cascading rock as the ancient defense mechanism sealed shut the gates of Pax Tharkas This is your final act of defiance Verminaard roared His speech had been interrupted by the fall of the rocks an act that only enraged him more I offered you a chance to work to further the glory of my Queen I cared for you and your families But you are stubborn and foolish You will pay with your lives The Dragon Highlord raised Nightbringer high in the air I will destroy the men I will destroy the women I will destroy the children At a touch of the Dragon Highlords hand Pyros spread his huge wings and leaped high into the air The dragon drew in a deep breath preparing to swoop down upon the mass of people who wailed in terror in the wideopen courtyard and incinerate them with his fiery breath But the dragons deadly dive was stopped Sweeping up into the sky from the pile of rubble made when she crashed out of the fortress Matafleur flew straight at Pyros The ancient dragon had sunk deeper into her madness Once more she relived the nightmare of losing her children She could see the knights upon the silver and golden dragons the wicked dragonlances gleaming in the sunshine In vain she pleaded with her children not to join the hopeless fight in vain she sought to convince them the war was at an end They were young and would not listen They flew off leaving her weeping in her lair As she watched in her minds eye the bloody final battle as she saw her children die upon the dragonlances she heard Verminaards voice I will destroy the children And as she had done so many centuries before Matafleur flew out to defend them Pyros stunned by the unexpected attack swerved just in time to avoid the broken yet still lethal teeth of the old dragon aiming for his unprotected flanks Matafleur hit him a glancing blow tearing painfully into one of the heavy muscles that drove the giant wings Rolling in the air Pyros lashed out at the passing Matafleur with a wicked taloned forefoot tearing a gash in the female dragons soft underbelly In her madness Matafleur did not even feel the pain but the force of the larger and younger male dragons blow knocked her backwards in the air The rollover manuever had been an instinctive defensive action on the part of the male dragon He had been able to gain both altitude and time to plan his attack He had however forgotten his rider Verminaard riding without the dragonsaddle he used in battlelost his grip on the dragons neck and fell to the courtyard below It was not a long drop and he landed uninjured only bruised and momentarily shaken Most of the people around him fled in terror when they saw him rise to his feet butglancing around swiftlyhe noticed that there were four near the northern end of the courtyard who did not flee He turned to face those four The appearance of Matafleur and her sudden attack on Pyros jolted the captive people out of their state of panic This combined with the fall of Verminaard into their midst like the fall of some horrifying god accomplished what Elistan and the others had not The people were shaken out of their fear sense returned and they began fleeing south toward the safety of the mountains At this sight the draconian captain sent his forces pouring into the crowd He detailed another messenger a wyvem to fly from the fortress to recall the army The draconians surged into the refugees but if they hoped to cause a panic they failed The people had suffered enough They had allowed their freedom to be taken away once in return for the promise of peace and safety Now they understood that there could be no peace as long as these monsters roamed Krynn The people of Solace and Gatewaymen women and children fought back using every pitiful weapon they could grabrocks stones their own bare hands teeth and nails The companions became separated in the crowd Laurana was cut off from everyone Gilthanas had tried to stay near her but he was carried off in the mob The elfmaiden more frightened than she believed possible and longing to hide fell back against the wall of the fortress her sword in her hand As she watched the raging battle in horror a man fell to the ground in front her clutching his stomach his fingers red with his own blood His eyes fixed in death seeming to stare at her as his blood formed a pool at her feet Laurana stared at the blood in horrid fascination then she heard a sound in front of her Shaking she looked updirectly into the hideous reptilian face of the mans killer The draconian seeing an apparently terrorstricken elven female before him figured on an easy kill Licking its bloodstained sword with its long tongue the creature jumped over the body of his victim and lunged for Laurana Clutching her sword her throat aching with terror Laurana reacted out of sheer defensive instinct She stabbed blindly jabbing upward The draconian was caught totally offguard Laurana plunged her weapon into the draconians body feeling the sharp elven blade penetrate both armor and flesh hearing bone splinter and the creatures last gurgling scream It turned to stone yanking the sword from her hand But Laurana thinking with a cold detachment that amazed her knew from hearing the warriors talk that if she waited a moment the stone body would turn to dust releasing her weapon The sounds of battle raged around her the screams the death cries the thuds and groans the clash of steelbut she heard none of it She waited calmly until she saw the body crumble Then she reached down and sifting the dust aside with her hand she grasped the hilt of her sword and lifted it into the air Sunlight flashed on the bloodstained blade her enemy lay dead at her feet She looked around but could not see Tanis She could not see any of the others For all she knew they might be dead For all she knew she might herself be dead within the next moment Laurana lifted her eyes to the sundrenched blue sky The world she might soon be leaving seemed newly madeevery object every stone every leaf stood out in painful clarity A warm fragrant southern breeze sprang up driving back the storm clouds that hung over her homeland to the north Lauranas spirit released from its prison of fear soared higher than the clouds and her sword flashed in the morning sun The Dragon Highlord Matafleurs children Verminaard studied the four men as they approached him These were not slaves he realized Then he recognized them as the ones who traveled with the goldenhaired cleric These then were the ones who had defeated Onyx in Xak Tsaroth escaped the slave caravan and broken into Pax Tharkas He felt as if he knew themthe knight from that broken land of past glories a halfelf trying to pass himself off as human a deformed sickly magician and the mages twina human giant whose brain was probably as thick as his arms It will be an interesting fight he thought He almost welcomed handtohand combatit had been a long time He was growing bored with commanding armies from the back of a dragon Thinking of Ember he glanced into the sky wondering if he might be able to summon aid But it appeared that the red dragon was having his own problems Matafleur had been fighting battles when Pyros was still in the egg what she lacked in strength she made up for in guile and cunning The air crackled with flames dragonblood dropped down like red rain Shrugging Verminaard looked back at the four approaching him warily He could hear the magicuser reminding his companions that Verminaard was a cleric of the Queen of Darkness andas suchcould call upon her aid Verminaard knew from his spies that this magicuser though young was imbued with a strange power and considered very dangerous The four did not speak There was no need for talk among these men nor was there need for talk between enemies Respect grudging as it may be was apparent on both sides As for the battlerage that was unnecessary This would be fought coolly The major victor would be death And so the four came forward spreading to outflank him since he had nothing to set his back against Crouching low Verminaard swung Nightbringer in an arc keeping them back forming his plans He must even the odds quickly Gripping Nightbringer in his right hand the evil cleric sprang forward from his crouched stance with all the strength in his powerful legs His sudden move took his opponents by surprise He did not raise his mace All he needed now was his deadly touch Landing on his feet in front of Raistlin he reached out and grasped the magicuser by the shoulder whispering a swift prayer to his Dark Queen Raistlin screamed His body pierced by unseen unholy weapons he sank to the ground in agony Caramon gave a great bellowing roar and sprang at Verminaard but the cleric was prepared He swung the mace Nightbringer and struck the warrior a glancing blow Midnight Verminaard whispered and Caramons bellow changed to a shout of panic as the spellbound mace blinded him I cant see Tanis help me the big warrior cried stumbling about Verminaard laughing grimly struck him a solid blow to the head Caramon went down like a felled ox Out of the corner of his eye Verminaard saw the halfelf leap for him a twohanded sword of ancient elvish design in his hands Verminaard whirled blocking Taniss sword with Nightbringers massive oaken handle For a moment the two combatants were locked together but Verminaards greater strength won out and he hurled Tanis to the ground The Solamnic knight raised his sword in salutea costly mistake It gave Verminaard time to remove a small iron needle from a hidden pocket Raising it he called once more upon the Queen of Darkness to defend her cleric Sturm striding forward suddenly felt his body grow heavier and heavier until he could walk no more Tanis lying on the ground felt an unseen hand press down on him He couldnt move He couldnt turn his head His tongue was too thick to speak He could hear Raistlins screams choke off in pain He could hear Verminaard laugh and shout a hymn of praise to the Dark Queen Tanis could only watch in despair as the Dragon Highlord mace raised walked toward Sturm preparing to end the knights life Baravais Kbaras Verminaard said in Solamnic He lifted the mace in a gruesome mockery of the knights salute then aimed for the knights head knowing that this death would be the most torturous possible for a knightdying at the mercy of the enemy Suddenly a hand caught Verminaards wrist In astonishment he stared at the hand the hand of a female He felt a power to match his own a holiness to match his unholiness At her touch Verminaards concentration wavered his prayers to his Dark Queen faltered And then it was that the Dark Queen herself looked up to find a radiant god dressed in white and shining armor appear on the horizon of her plans She was not ready to fight this god she had not expected his return and so she fled to rethink her options and restructure her battle seeingfor the first time the possibility of defeat The Queen of Darkness withdrew and left her cleric to his fate Sturm felt the spell leave his body his muscles his own to command once more He saw Venninaard turn his fury on Goldmoon striking at her savagely The knight lunged forward seeing Tanis rise the elven sword flashing in the sunlight Both men ran toward Goldmoon but Riverwind was there before them Thrusting her out of the way the Plainsman received on his swordarm the blow of the clerics mace that had been intended to crush Goldmoons head Riverwind heard the cleric shout Midnight and his vision was obscured by the same unholy darkness that had overtaken Caramon But the Queshu warrior expecting this did not panic Riverwind could still hear his enemy Resolutely ignoring the pain of his injury he transferred the sword to his left hand and stabbed in the direction of his enemys harsh breathing The blade turned aside by the Dragon Highlords powerful armor was jarred from Riverwinds hand Riverwind fumbled for his dagger though he knew it was hopeless that death was certain At that moment Verminaard realized he was alone bereft of spiritual help He felt the cold skeletal hand of despair clutch at him and he called to his Dark Queen But she had turned away absorbed in her own struggle Verminaard began to sweat beneath the dragonmask He cursed it as the helm seemed to stifle him he couldnt catch his breath Too late he realized its unsuitableness for handtohand combatthe mask blocked his peripheral vision He saw the tall Plainsman blind and wounded before himhe could kill him at his leisure But there were two other fighters near The knight and the halfelf had been freed of the unholy spell he had cast on them and they were coming closer He could hear them Catching a glimpse of movement he turned quickly and saw the halfelf running toward him the elvish blade glistening But where was the knight Verminaard turned and backed up swinging his mace to keep them at bay while with his free hand he struggled to rip the dragonhelm from his head Too late Just as Verminaards hand closed over the visor the magic blade of KithKanan pierced his armor and slid into his back The Dragon Highlord screamed and whirled in rage only to see the Solamnic knight appear in his blooddimmed vision The ancient blade of Sturms fathers plunged into his bowels Verminaard feel to his knees Still he struggled to remove the helmhe couldnt breathe he couldnt see He felt another sword thrust then darkness overtook him High overhead a dying Matafleur weakened by loss of blood and many woundsheard the voices of her children crying to her She was confused and disoriented Pyros seemed to be attacking from every direction at once Then the big red dragon was before her against the wall of the mountain Matafleur saw her chance She would save her children Pyros breathed a great blast of flame directly into the face of the ancient red dragon He watched in satisfaction as the head withered the eyes melted But Matafleur ignored the flames that seared her eyes forever ending her vision and flew straight at Pyros The big male dragon his mind clouded by fury and pain and thinking he had finished his enemy was taken by surprise Even as he breathed again his deadly fire he realized with horror the position he was inhe had allowed Matafleur to manuever him between herself and the sheer face of the mountain He had nowhere to go no room to turn Matafleur soared into him with all the force of her oncepowerful body striking him like a spear hurled by the gods Both dragons slammed against the mountain The peak trembled and split apart as the face of the mountain exploded in flames In later years when the Death of Flamestrike was legend there were those who claimed to have heard a dragons voice fade away like smoke on an autumn wind whispering My children The Wedding The last day of autumn dawned clear and bright The air was warmtouched by the fragrant wind from the south which had blown steadily ever since the refugees fled Pax Tharkas taking with them only what they could scrounge from the fortress as they fled the wrath of the dragonarmies It had taken long days for the draconian army to scale the walls of Pax Tharkas its gates blocked by boulders its towers defended by gully dwarves Led by Sestun the gully dwarves stood on top of the walls throwing rocks dead rats and occasionally each other down on the frustrated draconians This allowed the refugees time to escape into the mountains where although they skirmished with small forces of draconians they were not seriously threatened Flint volunteered to lead a party of men through the mountains searching for a place where the people could spend the winter These mountains were familiar to Flint since the hill dwarves homeland was not far to the south Flints party discovered a valley nestled between vast craggy peaks whose treacherous passes were choked with snow in the winter The passes could be easily held against the might of the dragonarmies and there were caves where they could hide from the fury of the dragons Following a dangerous path the refugees fled into the mountains and entered the valley An avalanche soon blocked the route behind them and destroyed all trace of their passing It would be months before the draconians discovered them The valley far below the mountain peaks was warm and sheltered from the harsh winter winds and snows The woods were filled with game Clear streams flowed from the mountains The people mourned their dead rejoiced in their deliverance built shelters and celebrated a wedding On the last day of autumn as the sun set behind the mountains kindling their snowcapped peaks with flame the color of dying dragons Riverwind and Goldmoon were married When the two came to Elistan to ask him to preside over their exchange of vows he had been deeply honored and had asked them to explain the ways of their people to him Both of them replied steadily that their people were dead The Queshu were gone their ways were no more This will be our ceremony Riverwind said The beginning of something new not the continuation of that which has passed away Though we will honor the memory of our people in our hearts Goldmoon added softly we must look forward not behind We will honor the past by taking from it the good and the sorrowful that have made us what we are But the past shall rule us no longer Elistan therefore studied the Disks of Mishakal to find what the ancient gods taught about marriage He asked Goldmoon and Riverwind to write their own vows searching their hearts for the true meaning of their lovefor these vows would be spoken before the gods and last beyond death One custom of the Queshu the couple kept This was that the bridegift and the groomgift could not be purchased This symbol of love must be made by the hand of the beloved The gifts would be exchanged with the saying of the vows As the suns rays spread across the sky Elistan took his place on the top of a gentle rise The people gathered in silence at the foot of the hill From the east came Tika and Laurana bearing torches Behind them walked Goldmoon Chieftains Daughter Her hair fell down around her shoulders in streams of molten gold mingled with silver Her head was crowned with autumn leaves She wore the simple fringed doeskin tunic she had worn through their adventures The medallion of Mishakal glittered at her throat She carried her bridegift wrapped in a cloth as fine as cobweb for the beloved ones eyes must be the first to see it Tika walked before her in solemn mistyeyed wonder the young girls heart filled with dreams of her own beginning to think that this great mystery shared by men and women might not be the terrifying experience she had feared but something sweet and beautiful Laurana next to Tika held her torch high brightening the days dying light The people murmured at Goldmoons beauty they fell silent when Laurana passed Goldmoon was human her beauty the beauty of the trees and mountains and skies Lauranas beauty was elvish otherworldly mysterious The two women brought the bride to Elistan then they turned looking to the west waiting for the groom A blaze of torches lit Riverwinds way Tanis and Sturm their solemn faces wistful and gentle led Riverwind came behind towering over the others his face stern as always But a radiant joy brighter than the torches lit his eyes His black hair was crowned with autumn leaves his groomgift covered by one of Tasslehoffs hankerchiefs Behind him walked Flint and the kender Caramon and Raistlin came last the mage bearing the lightedcrystal Staff of Magius instead of a torch The men brought the groom to Elistan then stepped back to join the women Tika found herself standing next to Caramon Reaching out timidly she touched his hand Smiling down at her gently he clasped her little hand in his big one As Elistan looked at Riverwind and Goldmoon he thought of the terrible grief and fear and danger they had faced the harshness of their lives Did their future hold anything different For a moment he was overcome and could not speak The two seeing Elistans emotion and perhaps understanding his sorrow reached out to him reassuringly Elistan drew them close to him whispering words for them alone It was your love and your faith in each other that brought hope to the world Each of you was willing to sacrifice your life for this promise of hope each has saved the life of the other The sun shines now but already its rays are dimming and night is ahead It is the same for you my friends You will walk through much darkness before morning But your love will be as a torch to light the way Elistan then stepped back and began to speak to all assembled His voice husky to begin with grew stronger and stronger as he felt the peace of the gods surround him and confirm their blessings on this couple The left hand is the hand of the heart he said placing Goldmoons left hand in Riverwinds left hand and holding his own left hand over them We join left hands that the love in the hearts of this man and this woman may combine to form something greater as two streams join together to form a mighty river The river flows through the land branching off into tributaries exploring new ways yet ever drawn to the eternal sea Receive their love Paladinegreatest of the gods bless it and grant them peace at least in the hearts if there is no peace in this shattered land In the blessed silence husbands and wives put their arms around each other Friends drew close children quieted and crept near their parents Hearts filled with mourning were comforted Peace was granted Pledge your vows one to another Elistan said and exchange the gifts of your hands and hearts Goldmoon looked into Riverwinds eyes and began to speak softly Wars have settled on the North and dragons ride the skies Now is the time for wisdom say the wise and the nearly wise Here in the heart of battle the time to be brave is at hand Now most things are larger than the promise of woman to man But you and I through burning plains through darkness of the earth affirm this world its people the heavens that gave them birth the breath that passes between us this altar where we stand and all those things made larger by the promise of woman to man Then Riverwind spoke Now in the belly of winter when ground and sky are gray here in the heart of sleeping snow now is the time to say yes to the sprouting vallenwood in the green countryside for these things are far larger than a mans word to his bride Through these promises we keep forged in the yawning night proved in the presence of heroes and the prospect of spring light the children will see moons and stars where now the dragons ride and humble things made large by a mans word to his bride When the vows were spoken they exchanged gifts Goldmoon shyly handed her present to Riverwind He unwrapped it with hands that trembled It was a ring plaited of her own hair bound with bands of silver and of gold as fine as the hair the surrounded Goldmoon had given Flint her mothers jewelry the dwarfs old hands had not lost their touch In the wreckage of Solace Riverwind had found a vallenwood branch spared by the dragons fire and had carried it in his pack Now that branch made Riverwinds gift to Goldmoona ring perfectly smooth and plain When polished the wood of the tree was a rich gold color marked by streaks and whorls of softest brown Goldmoon holding it remembered the first night she had seen the great vallenwoods the night they had stumbledweary and frightenedinto Solace bearing the blue crystal staff She began to cry softly and wiped her eyes with Tass handkerchief Bless the gifts Paladine Elistan said these symbols of love and sacrifice Grant that during times of deepest darkness these two may look upon these gifts and see their path lighted by love Great and shining god god of human and elf god of kender and dwarf give your blessing to these your children May the love they plant in their hearts today be nourished by their souls and grow into a tree of life providing shelter and protection to all who seek refuge beneath its spreading boughs With the joining of hands the exchanging of vows the giving of gifts you twoRiverwind grandson of Wanderer and Goldmoon Chieftains Daughterbecome onein your hearts in the sight of men in the eyes of the gods Riverwind took his ring from Goldmoon and placed it upon her slender finger Goldmoon took her ring from Riverwind He knelt before heras would have been the custom of the Queshu But Goldmoon shook her head Rise warrior she said smiling through her tears Is that a command he asked softly It is the last command of Chieftains Daughter she whispered Riverwind stood up Goldmoon placed the golden ring on his finger Then Riverwind took her in his arms She put her arms around him Their lips met their bodies melded together their spirits joined The people gave a great shout and torches flared The sun sank behind the mountains leaving the sky bathed in a pearllike hue of purples and soft reds which soon deepened into the sapphire of night The bride and groom were carried down the hill by the cheering throng and feasting and merriment began Huge tables carved from the pine trees of the forest were set up on the grass The children freed at last from the awe of the ceremony ran and shouted playing at dragonslaying Tonight care and worry were far from their minds Men broached the huge casks of ale and wine they had salvaged in Pax Tharkas and began drinking salutes to the bride and groom Women brought in huge plates of foodgame and fruits and vegetables gathered in the forest and taken from the stores in Pax Tharkas Get out of my way dont crowd me Caramon grumbled as he sat down at the table The companions laughing moved over to give the big man room Maritta and two other women came forward and placed a huge platter of deer meat before the big warrior Real food sighed the warrior Hey roared Flint stabbing at a piece of sizzling meat on Caramons plate with his fork you gonna eat that Caramon promptly and silentlywithout missing a bite emptied a flagon of ale over the dwarfs head Tanis and Sturm sat side by side talking quietly Taniss eyes strayed to Laurana occasionally She sat at a different table talking animatedly with Elistan Tanis thinking how lovely she looked tonight realized how changed she was from the willful lovesick girl who had followed him from Qualinesti He told himself he liked the change in her But he caught himself wondering just what she and Elistan found so interesting Sturm touched his arm Tanis started He had lost track of the conversation Flushing he began to apologize when he saw the look on Sturms face What is it Tanis said in alarm halfrising Hush dont move Sturm ordered Just lookover theresitting off to himself Tanis looked where Sturm gestured puzzled then he saw the mansitting alone hunched over his food eating it absently as if he didnt really taste it Whenever anyone approached the man shrank back eyeing him nervously until he passed Suddenly perhaps sensing Taniss eyes on him he raised his head and stared directly at them The halfelf gasped and dropped his fork But thats impossible he said in a strangled voice We saw him die With Eben No one could have survived Then I was right Sturm said grimly You recognize him too I thought I was going mad Lets go talk to him But when they looked again he was gone Swiftly they searched the crowd but it was impossible to find him now As the silver moon and the red rose in the sky the married couples formed a ring around the bride and groom and began singing wedding songs Unmarried couples danced in pairs outside the circle while the children leaped and shouted and reveled in staying up past their bedtime Bonfires burned brightly voices and music filled the night air the silver moon and the red rose to light the sky Goldmoon and Riverwind stood their arms around each other their eyes shining brighter than the moons or the blazing fire Tanis lingered on the outskirts watching his friends Laurana and Gilthanas performed an ancient elvish dance of grace and beauty singing together a hymn of joy Sturm and Elistan fell into conversation about their plans to travel south in search of the legendary seaport city of Tarsis the Beautiful where they hoped to find ships to carry the people from this wartorn land Tika tired of watching Caramon eat teased Flint until the dwarf finally agreed to dance with her blushing bright red beneath his beard Where was Raistlin Tanis wondered The halfelf recalled seeing him at the banquet The mage ate little and drank his herbal mixture He had seemed unusually pale and quiet Tanis decided to go in search of him The company of the darksouled cynical mage seemed more suited to him tonight than music and laughter Tanis wandered into the moonlit darkness knowing somehow he was headed in the right direction He found Raistlin sitting on the stump of an old tree whose lightningshattered blackened remains lay scattered over the ground The halfelf sat down next to the silent mage A small shadow settled among the trees behind the halfelf Finally Tas would hear what these two discussed Raistlins strange eyes stared into the southlands barely visible between a gap in the tall mountains The wind still blew from the south but it was beginning to veer again The temperature was falling Tanis felt Raistlins frail body shiver Looking at him in the moonlight Tanis was startled to see the mages resemblance to his halfsister Kitiara It was a fleeting impression and gone almost as soon as it came but it brought the woman to Taniss mind adding to his feelings of unrest and disquiet He restlessly tossed a piece of bark back and forth from hand to hand What do you see to the south Tanis asked abruptly Raistlin glanced at him What do I ever see with these eyes of mine HalfElf the mage whispered bitterly I see death death and destruction I see war He gestured up above The constellations have not returned The Queen of Darkness is not defeated We may not have won the war Tanis began but surely we have won a major battle Raistlin coughed and shook his head sadly Do you see no hope Hope is the denial of reality It is the carrot dangled before the draft horse to keep him plodding along in a vain attempt to reach it Are you saying we should just give up Tanis asked irritably tossing the bark away Im saying we should remove the carrot and walk forward with our eyes open Raistlin answered Coughing he drew his robes more closely around him How will you fight the dragons Tanis For there will be more More than you can imagine And where now is Huma Where now is the Dragonlance No HalfElf Do not talk to me of hope Tanis did not answer nor did the mage speak again Both sat silently one continuing to stare south the other glancing up into the great voids in the glittering starlit sky Tasslehoff sank back into the soft grass beneath the pine trees No hope the kender repeated bleakly sorry he had followed the halfelf I dont believe it he said but his eyes went to Tanis staring at the stars Tanis believes it the kender realized and the thought filled him with dread Ever since the death of the old magician an unnoticed change had come over the kender Tasslehoff began to consider that this adventure was in earnest that it had a purpose for which people gave their lives He wondered why he was involved and thought perhaps he had given the answer to Fizbanthe small things he was meant to do were important somehow in the big scheme of things But until now it had never occurred to the kender that all this might be for nothing that it might not make any difference that they might suffer and lose people they loved like Fizban and the dragons would still win in the end Still the kender said softly we have to keep trying and hoping Thats whats importantthe trying and the hoping Maybe thats most important of all Something floated gently down from the sky brushing past the kenders nose Tas reached out and caught it in his hand It was a small white chicken feather The Song of Huma was the lastand many consider the greatestwork of the elven bard Quivalen Soth Only fragments of the work remained following the Cataclysm It is said that those who study it diligently willl find hints to the future o the turning world SONG OF HUMA Out of the village out of the thatched and clutching shires Out of the grave and furrow furrow and grave Where his sword first tried The last cruel dances of childhood and awoke to the shires Forever retreating his greatness a marshfire The banked flight of the Kingfisher always above him Now Huma walked upon Roses In the level Light of the Rose And troubled by Dragons he turned to the end of the land To the fringe of all sense and senses To the Wilderness where Paladine bade him to turn And there in the loud tunnel of knives He grew in unblemished violence in yearning Stunned into himself by a deafening gauntlet of voices It was there and then that the White Stag found him At the end of a journey planned from the shores of Creation And all time staggered at the forest edge Where Huma haunted and starving Drew his bow thanking the gods for their bounty and keeping Then saw in the ranged wood In the first silence the dazed hearts symbol The rack of antlers resplendent He lowered the bow and the world resumed Then Huma followed the Stag its tangle of antlers receding As a memory of young light as the talons of birds ascending The Mountain crouched before them Nothing would change now The three moons stopped in the sky And the long night tumbled in shadows It was morning when they reached the grove The lap of the mountain where the Stag departed Nor did Huma follow knowing the end of this journey Was nothing but green and the promise of green that endured In the eyes of the woman before him And holy the days he drew near her holy the air That carried his words of endearment his forgotten songs And the rapt moons knelt on the Great Mountain Still she eluded him bright and retreating as marshfire Nameless and lovely more lovely because she was nameless As they learned that the world the dazzling shelves of the air The Wilderness itself Were plain and diminished things to the hearts thicket At the end of the days she told him her secret For she was not of woman nor was she mortal But daughter and heiress from a line of Dragons For Huma the sky turned indifferent cluttered by moons The brief life of the grass mocked him mocked his fathers And the thorned light bristled on the gliding Mountain But nameless she tendered a hope not in her keeping That Paladine only might answer that through his enduring wisdom She might step from forever and there in her silver arms The promise of the grove might rise and flourish For that wisdom Huma prayed and the Stag returned And east through the desolate fields through ash Through cinders and blood the harvest of dragons Traveled Huma cradled by dreams of the Silver Dragon The Stag perpetual a signal before him At last the eventual harbor a temple so far to the east That it lay where the east was ending There Paladine appeared In a pool of stars and glory announcing That of all choices one most terrible had fallen to Huma For Paladine knew that the heart is a nest of yearnings That we can travel forever toward light becoming What we can never be For the bride of Huma could step into the devouring sun Together they would return to the thatched shires And leave behind the secret of the Lance the world Unpeopled in darkness wed to the dragons Or Huma could take on the Dragonlance cleansing all Krynn Of death and invasion of the green paths of his love The hardest of choices and Huma remembered How the Wilderness cloistered and baptized his first thoughts Beneath the sheltering sun and now As the black moon wheeled and pivoted drawing the air And the substance from Krynn from the things of Krynn From the grove from the Mountain from the abandoned shires He would sleep he would send it all away For the choosing was all of the pain and the choices Were heat on the hand when the arm has been severed But she came to him weeping and luminous In a landscape of dreams where he saw The world collapse and renew on the glint of the Lance In her farewell lay collapse and renewal Through his doomed veins the horizon burst He took up the Dragonlance he took up the story The pale heat rushed through his rising arm And the sun and the three moons waiting for wonders Hung in the sky together To the West Huma rode to the High Clerists Tower On the back of the Silver Dragon And the path of their flight crossed over a desolate country Where the dead walked only mouthing the names of dragons And the men in the Tower surrounded and riddled by dragons By the cries of the dying the roar in the ravenous air Awaited the unspeakable silence Awaited far worse in fear that the crash of the senses Would end in a moment of nothing Where the mind lies down with its losses and darkness But the winding of Humas horn in the distance Danced on the battlements All of Solamnia lifted Its face to the eastern sky and the dragons Wheeled to the highest air believing Some terrible change had come From out of their tumult of wings out of the chaos of dragons Out of the heart of nothing the Mother of Night Aswirl in a blankness of colors Swooped to the East into the stare of the sun And the sky collapsed into silver and blankness On the ground Huma lay at his side a woman Her silver skin broken the promise of green Released from the gifts of her eyes She whispered her name As the Queen of Darkness banked in the sky above Huma She descended the Mother of Night And from the loft of the battlements men saw shadows Boil on the colorless dive of her wings A hovel of thatch and rushes the heart of a Wilderness A lost silver light spattered in terrible crimson And then from the center of shadows Came a depth in which darkness itself was aglimmer Denying all air all light all shadows And thrusting his lance into emptiness Huma fell to the sweetness of death into abiding sunlight Through the Lance through the dear might and brotherhood Of those who must walk to the end of the breath and the senses He banished the dragons back to the core of nothing And the long lands blossomed in balance and music Stunned in new freedom stunned by the brightness and colors By the harped blessing of the holy winds The Knights carried Huma they carried the Dragonlance To the grove in the lap of the Mountain When they returned to the grove in pilgrimage in homage The Lance the armor the Dragonbane himself Had vanished to the days eye But the night of the full moons red and silver Shines down on the hills on the forms of a man and a woman Shimmering steel and silver silver and steel Above the village over the thatched and nurturing shires Quaraband Quaraband was a city of tents There were no permanent buildings only domelike yurts of white and black spread out in the shallow bowl of a valley The little round shelters were scattered in dense clumps large and small radiating out from the river that meandered across the valley from the south The space between each yurt was cluttered with heavy woodenwheeled carts ox yokes racks of drying meat hobbled horses and camels Here and there were wicker corrals for horses and sheep Thin trails of smoke drifted from the cooking fires between the yurts Farther out were herds of horses cattle and sheep grazing on the greening grass of the spring steppe The stubby grass broke through the pitted crust of old snow that still dotted the plain White snow green grass and brown dirt covered the flat ground in broken patches stretching as far as one could see There were no trees only gently rolling hillocks that rippled to the horizon Dark scars from old gullies made jagged cuts across the barren land Small clumps of bright blue and pink the blooms of early crocus and dwarf lily struggled against the cold to bring the first signs of spring to the land Chanar Ong Kho a general of the Tuigan seemed to glisten as sunlight played off the burnished metal scales of his armor The light emphasized the luster of Chanars thick braids and the thin sheen of sweat on the shaven patch at the top of his head The sword at his side its scabbard set with sapphires and garnets swung in rhythm to his mares swaying steps scratching out a beat as it scraped against the generals metal leggings Saddle leather creaked as Chanar looked back to see if his companion was impressed The man a gaunt rider on a black mare lurched along parallel to a long winding file of mounted soldiersa small part of the ten thousand men under General Chanars command The companion wore what were once bright orange robes though they were now travelstained and worn His head was shaven and around his neck hung several strings of beads each ending in a small prayer case of silver filigree The priest rode stiffly bouncing with every jolt not with the natural grace of his fellow horseman Chanar waited with bemused distaste as the priest pulled alongside Tonight Koja of the Khazari youll sleep in the tents of the Tuigan Chanar announced as he leaned forward to stroke his mares neck Even though its only been a few nights under the sky Three weeks is more than a few nights Koja observed The priest spoke haltingly with a musical inflection illsuited to the guttural twists of the Tuigan tongue It was a language clearly different from his own Even you honorable general must welcome a night in warmer surroundings Warm or cold Khazari it makes no difference to me The Blue Wolf gave birth to our ancestors in the bitter cold of winter My home is where I stand Learn that if you mean to stay with us General Chanar answered Snapping the flank of the dapple mare with his knout the general urged his horse into a gallop toward Quaraband leaving the foreign priest behind Koja let out an exasperated sigh as he watched the horsewarrior gallop ahead Once again Koja had to put up with the arrogance of the Tuigan general The priest was saddlestiff dustcaked and sunscorched after three weeks of constant riding The Khazari had traveled with the general and ten thousand Tuigan warriors through forests over mountains and finally across the dry and empty steppe to reach the great capital of the Tuigan people He had left the comforts of civilization far behind Now the capital of these mysterious warriors men who bedeviled the valuable caravan trade lay ahead This khahan emperor of the Tuigan could wait a few more minutes while he looked their city over It was primitive rusticand it took Kojas breath away There wasnt a single stone building in Quaraband The little tentsyurtswere dirty felt mounds but the sheer number of them was aweinspiring There were thousands of the yurts set up upon the plain Quaraband covered the valley floor a mile or more in each direction A gray smudge of smoke hung over the tents the residue from hundreds of fires It had an acrid tang that came from burning dung This unpleasant fuel was a necessity since there was precious little else to burn on the treeless steppe A cloud of dust swirled up in front of Koja partially obscuring his view of the city The line of troopers snaked past the sound of snorting horses grumbled curses and creaking leather suddenly reminded the priest of where he was General Chanar was well ahead trotting toward Quaraband Koja awkwardly spurred his own horse forward hurrying to catch up Just at the outskirts of the tent city the priest rejoined General Chanar The warlord barely noticed as the dallying priest came apace Instead the general turned back to survey the dispositions of his men The ten thousand riders were already breaking into smaller groups directed by the yurtchis the officers responsible for laying out the camp Satisfied that his men were being taken care of Chanar turned back to where Koja sat on his horse Come with me I must present you to Yamun Khahan Chanar ordered He spit on the ground clearing the dust from his throat then tapped his horse forward Koja followed As they passed through the yurts Koja studied them closely The round tents were made from thick felt pounded into rugs and stretched over a wooden frame Each doorway was covered with a loose rug that could be pulled aside to let in fresh air and light The roofs bulged at the very top where a smoke hole provided a little ventilation Judging by the dirty exteriors Koja doubted the yurts were bright and cheery inside As they passed one yurt whose door was open Koja caught the thick odors of sweat grease and smoke issuing from the inside A small troop of riders roughlooking men with buttercolored skin approached the priest and the general The riders wore identical black robes and pointed furtrimmed caps topped with long red tassels Each man carried a curved saber at his side Yamun Khahan sends these men to escort the valiant Chanar Ong Kho to the khahans home He asks Chanar to share drinks with him hailed the lead rider as the men approached As he spoke the man eyed Koja curiously Chanar nodded in acceptance then motioned toward the priest Tell the khahan that Ive brought an ambassador of the Khazari along from Semphar At the command of the lead rider one of the escort galloped away with the message The group continued in silence As they rode women peered shyly from behind tent flaps and dirty barelegged children ventured out to see the stranger riding by The riders skirted the cooking fires where pots bubbled filling the air with the strong odor of boiled mutton Soon they reached a palisade of simple wooden stakes The fence was five feet high and ringed the base of a low hill that stood alongside the river Beyond the fence Koja saw five large yurts bigger than any he had passed The largest yurt dark black occupied the top of the hill The others clustered around it were smaller and powdered white with chalk Primitive figures formed a printed band around the top of each yurt Ive come to see Yamun Khahan my anda General Chanar announced formally to the blackrobed guard at the entrance Koja noted the curious phrase Chanar used which apparently denoted some close bond between the general and the khahan The guard hurriedly pulled aside the simple gate and allowed the riders to pass through Grayrobed servants ran forward and held the horses while Chanar and Koja dismounted The general carefully straightened his armor tugging at the hems of his greaseand sweatsoaked silk undershirt Satisfied Chanar turned to the priest and declared flatly Youll stay here until I send for you Sharply he turned and strode up the small hill toward the large central yurt Suddenly stranded by his host Koja stood awkwardly still The men of the armed escort were nearby in small knots talking among themselves At intervals perhaps prompted by a word or a thought one of the guards would suddenly look Kojas way stare through narrowed eyelids for a little while and then just as abruptly return to the conversation The priest stood then squatted then stood again No one made any attempt to speak to him or show him the hospitality an ambassador was properly due Koja was hardly surprised given what he saw was the barbarism of the Tuigan Still he had hoped for better For a time Koja was content to study the men in his escort They might have been young men but their faces were so heavily weatherbeaten that their actual ages were impossible to determine Long thin mustaches were the favored style among these warriors They had no beards and a few of the olderlooking men had long ago taken knives to their cheeks scarring them so badly that their beards could not grow Most wore their hair in long braids that hung down in front of their ears This was not unusual but the way they shaved the crowns of their heads was quite distinctive After the priest waited for an hour or more dusk fell Koja roamed a little slowly at first to see if the guards would notice He walked a short way up the slope toward the banner that stood halfway between the gate and the largest yurt It was a pole fifteen feet tall with a crossbrace at the top From the arms hung nine long black horsetail plumes Affixed on the very top was a human skull Below the skull was a golden plaque while small dolls made of red cloth stood at the poles base Bits of hair and leather were stuck to these Koja studied the standard guessing at its significance A man came down from the large yurt dressed in a black robe with silk trim clearly an officer He stopped directly in front of Koja Koja of Khazaricome But first you must kneel to the khahans standard Koja looked at the dolls They were idols he realizedsome shamans spirit guardians probably the powers of earth and sky However they were certainly not any of the gods he knew from his training at the Red Mountain Temple I cannot Koja said softly I am a priest of Furo These are not my gods The officer looked at him darkly his hand sliding toward the sword at his side You must It is the khahans standard I mean no disrespect to your khahan but I cannot kneel to these gods Koja said flatly He crossed his arms and stood firm gambling that the guard would not strike him I cannot take you to the khahans yurt until you kneel protested the officer You must kneel Then I shall not see the khahan answered Koja A strained look crossed the officers face The blackgarbed officer stood in indecision The other guards came up to see what was happening The men and the officer fell into a heated whispered conversation Koja discreetly pretended not to notice returning to his examination of the idols Finally the officer gave in Turning to Koja he said You will come but the khahan will be told Your courage is great Koja praised allowing the officer to save face The priest pointed to the skull at the top of the pole What does that represent That is the khan of the Oigurs the officer said with relish He attempted to slay the khahan by luring him into a trap The Oigurs were the first people Yamun Khahan conquered so he honored them by placing their khan there Does he treat everyone in this way Koja asked as he eyed the dubious honor No only a fortunate few said the officer The other guards broke into laughter as they led the priest up the hill When he reached the khahans yurt Koja looked down to the plain below From the doorway the priest had a clear view of the entire Tuigan encampment It was clear why the khahan had chosen this hill as the site for his yurt The squat yurts of Quaraband stretched out below in a rough oval following the course of river The tent flap was pulled open as the officer beckoned Koja to enter Ducking his head through the opening the priest carefully stepped inside The khahans chamberlain tugged at Koja carefully making sure the priest did not accidentally step on the jamb a sure sign of evil luck Inside it was dark Koja willingly allowed himself to be led to a seat As he padded across the heavily carpeted floor the priest tried to focus his eyes in the gloom The Illustrious Emperor to the Tuigan Yamun Khahan leaned forward on his seat of cushions at the back of the yurt His face was lit by the flickering flames of oil lamps hung from the roof poles of the Great Yurt The light barely revealed his reddish hair bound into long braids Occasionally light glinted off the pale jagged scar that ran across the bridge of his nose and over his cheek A second old scar gave the khahans upper lip a slight curl Not far from the khahan General Chanar sat on the rugs only a single cushion beneath him The warrior sipped at the hot cup of tea he cradled in his hands As Koja settled into his seat Chanar leaned over to the khahan and spoke softly The khahan listened then shook his head gently apparently vetoing the generals suggestion So envoy of the Khazari what did you think of the grand council of Semphar boomed out Yamun Khahan from the far side of the yurt Koja was surprised by the khahans directness but quickly regained his composure Surely Khahan of the Tuigan General Chanar has told you about the conference I am only an ambassador of the Khazari Koja protested Youre going to tell me about this great conference at Semphar the khahan ordered bluntly scratching at his cheek I have already heard the general speak What did the Sempharans have to say Well Lord Yamun the caliph of Semphar was uh surprised Koja shifted his legs trying to find a comfortable position Yamun Khahan snorted with laughter and drained his silver goblet setting it down on the thick woolen rugs with a muffled thump Surprised I send my best general with ten thousand men a complete tumen and the caliph is only surprised Do you hear this He leaned toward Chanar who was sitting stonefaced while Koja talked A servant came out of the shadows to pour the khahan another goblet of heated wine and dropped a pierced silver ball filled with herbs into it Yamun his face stern and unsmiling turned back to the envoy This caliph didnt tremble in fear at the sight of General Chanar Perhaps he did Khahan of the Tuigan but never that I saw Koja found his gaze locked with the khahans In the dim light the rulers eyes were black and riveting Flustered Koja could feel his blood reddening his face even making his bald scalp tingle The priest suddenly wondered if the khahan was some type of sorcerer Unconsciously his fingers fumbled with one of the small scripture lockets that hung around his neck Chanar cocked an eyebrow noticing what the envoy was doing Your charms and spells wont help you here Khazari No magic functions within this valley Koja stopped in surprise slightly embarrassed when he realized what he was doing No magic How is that possible He looked to Chanar for an answer but it was Yamun who replied Teylas the Sky God banished the magicor thats what the Second Empress Bayalun Khadun tells me I dont care how it happened No magic makes this a good place for my capital a safe place answered Yamun Khahan between swallows of wine Isnt life difficult without magic Koja asked softly If Teylas wanted life to be easy he wouldnt have given us the steppe for a home And he would have given me an easier people to rule commented Yamun as he finished off another goblet of wine Enough of this Was the council impressed when General Chanar told them my demands Will they pay a tax for the caravans Do they recognize me as ruler of the whole world Koja thought carefully about the answer They were outraged by your boldness Lord Khahan Many of them took exception to your claims As the king of Cormyr pointed out You do not rule the entire world Koja heard a soft irritated snort from Chanar The khahan slowly stood stretching his legs He was not a tall man but was still imposing His chest was broad and his neck was thick with corded muscles He slowly walked with a bowlegged swagger toward the door of the tent All the while he kept his eyes on the seated priest the same way a desert cat watches its prey Cormeer Ive never heard of such a place Koja still seated on the woolen rugs that covered the floor scuttled around to keep facing the khahan Although the evening was chill the lama was sweating in the stuffy tent His orange robes were damp and clammy Slightly frosty breezes slipped in through the minute gaps in the felt walls of the yurt Is it far quizzed Yamun tugging at his mustache Great Lord asked Koja confused by the sudden shift of the conversation This place Cormeeris it far away I dont know It is a land far to the west even far from Semphar I have never been there But this king he talks bravely What is he like The king is named Azoun He is a strangelooking man with pale skin and thick hair on his face Pah I asked what he is like not what he looks like the khahan snapped He was a king Khahan Koja said unable to think of a better word He was bold and seemed brave The others listened to him and seemed to respect his words He sounds like a man to meet I will go to Cormeer someday and then we will see how brave Azoun is Yamun decided slapping his thigh So this king was not impressed My words were not enough Koja tried to slowly and calmly explain what had happened at the council at least the way he saw it The leaders came to the council to talk They did not bring armies only their wizards priests and guards They were not pleased upset After all there was a huge army of Tuigan soldiers camped outside the city Soldiers make very poor diplomats Diplomats Old men from tents that have no warriorsthose are diplomats Your diplomats meet because they are worried about their caravans Yamun tapped one of the center posts of the yurt You think I didnt hear these things envoy Your khans and emperors thought they could fix everything without me but I rule this land I rule all the tribes of the land and nothing is decided without my word declared Yamun So I sent my own envoyswarriors with fat horses and bundles of arrows With all due respect Khahan all the ambassadors saw was a great army of men and a brazen general Koja replied respectfully bowing his head to the floor There was a sharp hissing of breath and a muttered curse from General Chanar Koja bit his lip as he realized hed just slighted the warlord A brazen general Yamun said softly as he turned away from Koja twisting his mustache between his fingers What do you mean brazen General Chanar is a warrior Koja answered carefully hoping that would be sufficient The khahan tilted his head and waited for more Nervous Koja rubbed his neck Well those at the council expected soft words General Chanar was insulting These are lies my khahan Prince Chanar asserted as he shifted in his seat This foreigner has insulted me Chanars hand slid to the hilt of his saber Glowering he stood and stepped toward Koja I say youre a liar and you will pay There was a scraping sound as he started to draw his sword from its scabbard Chanar Ong Kho sit down rumbled Yamun his calm voice carrying easily over the generals mumbled threats There was a quality of iron in the deeply resonant words Will you dishonor my tent with bloodshed Stay your sword This priest is my guest He has insulted me Chanar insisted Didnt I say the council trembled in fear That they were awed by our might Is a foreigner allowed to mock me in your yurt Sword halfdrawn he turned to face Yamun Chanars body was tense his back arched his arms stiff Yamun strode directly up to Chanar unflinching in the steady gaze of the general Looking up into Chanars eyes he spoke slowly and softly but with a hard edge Chanar you are my anda my bloodfriend Weve fought together There is no one I trust more than you I have never doubted your word but this is my tent and he is my guest Now sit and think no more of this Yamun closed his hand over Chanars on the sword hilt Yamun I petition you Hes lied about me I will not let him stain my honor I will not have this Chanar tried to pull his hand free but Yamuns grip kept it in place General Chanar you will sit down the khahan replied His voice thundered as he spit out the words in tightly clipped fury I listen to this man he said flinging his finger toward Koja but do I believe Perhaps I should if he angers you so Chanar trembled caught between rage and loyalty Finally he slid the blade back into its scabbard and silently strode back to his seat There he sat staring darkly at the priest All through the exchange Koja stayed quiet a slight shiver of nervousness and fear running through him He marveled at the liberties the general had taken in the presence of his lord Yamun casually returned to his cushions and waved for another cup of wine Chanar is my anda It is a special friendship like brothers to each other Because he is my anda Chanar Ong Kho has the right to speak freely before me Yamun paused to look closely at Koja You however are not my anda It would be wise for you to remember this when you speak The Tuigan do not take insults lightly I should have you whipped for your words but you are my guest so this time I only warn you the khahan calmly informed the surprised lama Chanars black looks softened I plead for forgiveness for offending the valiant Chanar Ong Kho I can see that he is a brave warrior Koja said bowing to the general Chanar coolly acknowledged the apology Yamun drew a small knife from a scabbard that hung at his belt and held it between himself and Chanar Brother Chanar this priest does not understand our bond This Koja of Khazari is what it means to be anda Yamun drew the knife across his hand making a small gash in the palm As the blood started to well out of the cut he handed the knife over to Chanar Chanar took the knife turning it back and forth so the light sparked off the blade Without saying a thing the general pulled the tip of the blade across his hand He bit down on his lip at the sudden pain As the first drops trickled out of the wound Yamun pressed his bleeding hand to Chanars clasping it tight Blood seeped from between their fingers splattering in droplets on the rugs The two men locked eyes the khahan confident the general smiling through the sting See priest we are anda Yamun said The khahan still showed no sign of pain He squeezed Chanars hand even harder drawing a faint wince from the general They gripped hands for a few minutes more then released each other the bond broken by unspoken communication I am your anda Yamun Chanar announced loudly if somewhat breathless for pain so Koja could hear The warrior held his hand in a fist Yamun settled back into the cushions paying little attention to his own wound A servant came forward with thick strips of felt and a bowl of hot water and set these between the two men Chanar began binding his own hand while the servant tried to fuss over the khahan Bring drinksblack kumissfor my anda and this visitor Yamun ordered Ill tend to myself The man disappeared for a moment then reappeared with a leather bag Setting out silver cups the servant ladled the drinks and placed them before the men Koja looked at the kumiss a curdled white color and sniffed at it gingerly The priest recognized it as fermented mares milk a drink popular among the Tuigan This was black kumiss drawn from the khahans own mares and considered the finest of all Koja took a sip of the bitter drink and then discreetly set the cup aside while the other men gulped the contents of their chalices My lord the lama eventually began but the khahan waved him off This audience is over Yamun announced Tomorrow well hold council to hear the message of this envoy He picked up his cup of kumiss and turned partially away from Chanar and the priest the signal for them to leave Reluctantly Chanar stood bowed to Yamun and strode out the door A blast of cold spring air blew through the doorway making the lamps flicker Koja took care not to turn his back on the khahan which would be considered an insult in the priests own country Yamun raised his hand to recognize the envoys leaving The hastily wrapped bandage across his palm slipped loose letting blood flow once again from the wound Seeing this Koja took the opportunity to be of aid Great Lord I have a little skill in healing wounds If I could be of some small service to my illustrious host it would bring great honor to my temple Koja knelt down touching his head to the floor Yamun turned back toward Koja one eyebrow arched as he studied the kowtowing priest If you have some skill with spells it will do you little good here Remember the power of magic is gone from this area I know Khahan of the Tuigan but at our temple we are taught the secrets of herbs It is something all of the chosen must learn Koja explained still kneeling What if you plan to poison me I would not do this great khahan I have come a long way to speak for my prince Koja explained looking up from the floor You have not even heard his words Yamun tilted his head and studied the priest Finally his lips twisted into a wry grin I think your words have merit Well then envoy of the Khazari lets see what your skills can do for my hand Koja sat himself at the feet of the khahan Reaching into his robes the priest brought out a small pouch he always carried From it he took a small strip of yellow paper covered in script a lump of incense and three dried leaves Taking Yamuns wounded hand Koja carefully began unwrapping the loose bandages The herbs are very cleansing but cause some pain Lord Yamun Koja warned crumbling the leaves into the Yamuns kumiss What of it Tell me about Semphar I only saw a little of it Khahan Koja began as he soaked a strip of cloth in the kumiss But it seemed like a powerful land The lama handed the winesoaked cloth to the khahan Squeeze on this Khahan If they are so powerful then why did the Sempharans call this council Yamun queried ignoring any pain as Koja washed out the wound Koja finished dabbing at the cut Caravans from east and west begin and end in Semphar so they become worried when the merchants are attacked and no longer travel the routes to Shou Lung Hold your hand flat please Koja pressed the yellow paper into the wound and carefully placed the incense on it The yellow was immediately tinged with red Standing Koja reached up and unhooked one of the lamps Still if they are mighty warriors why dont they send soldiers to protect their caravans Yamun asked as he poked at the paper on his hand Semphar is powerful but they are not horsemen The steppe is far from their homeland They did not know who ruled the lands of the steppe There have been many tribes here and many chieftains khans as you call them Koja fumbled in his pouch I am the khahan the khan of khans I rule the steppe Yamun declared Koja only nodded and lit another scrap of paper from his pouch off the lamp beside him Twice he passed the burning paper over the khahans hand muttering prayers Then he touched the flame to the incense Yamun twitched his hand to pull it away from the fire more in surprise than pain Keep your hand still Khahan The ash must be rubbed into the wound Yamun grunted in understanding For a time he watched the little ropes of sweet smoke coil upward from his hand Finally he spoke Since they do not attack me perhaps I must go to them Koja started at the suggestion Khahan Semphar is a mighty nation with great cities of stone with walls around them You could not capture these with horsemen They have many soldiers The khahan didnt seem to understand the greatness of the caliph Semphar does not want war but they will fight But they refused my demands didnt they Only because they seek more time to consider them Koja explained as he blew on the smoldering incense Theyre stalling They have no intention of obeying me and you know that priest Yamun pointed out The last wisps of smoke from the incense wafted over his palm Noble khahan it takes men time to decide My own prince Ogandi must hear what has happened at Semphar and then discuss it with the elders of Khazari Koja gently rubbed the warm ashes into the bloodsoaked paper That finished he began rewrapping the bandage around the khahans hand Then your people should know that I will destroy them if they refuse me the khahan promised in grim tones His face was emotionless and he watched Koja in silence letting his words sink in Koja shifted uneasily uncertain how to react to such a threat Then breaking the tension Yamun leaned forward and slapped the priest on the knee Now envoy tell me of the people and places you have seen It was almost dawn before the khahan permitted Koja to leave Exhausted from the strain of the meeting and thickheaded from the wine the priest stumbled out of the tent The icy wind snatched at his robes whipping and cracking them about his legs Shivering Koja wrapped a heavy sheepskin coat taken from the belongings still packed on his horse tightly about him but it did little good for his slippershod feet Stamping he worked to get the blood circulating through cold toes once again The khahans bodyguards watched the priest from where they huddled by a small fire In the three weeks that Koja had been traveling with the Tuigan men like these had watched over him For the most part they had eyed him silently but a few had been talkative It was from these men that Koja had learned the most about the Tuigan Not that it was much The Tuigan were nomads raising sheep cattle and camels But horses were their lives They ate horsemeat and brewed kumiss from the curdled mares milk They tanned horsehides and made plumes from horsetails They rode horses better than anyone Koja had ever seen It seemed as if every man was a warrior trained to use bow sword and lance The finest of these warriors were handpicked for the khahans bodyguard the Kashik These were the men who were now watching him from around their fire Each man was a proven warrior and killer One of them stood and announced himself as the priests escort The khahan invites you to stay at one of his yurts the squat guard said It wasnt phrased like an invitation but Koja didnt care The command would mean a tent and a tent would be warm Willingly following the guard Koja walked slowly sometimes stumbling over clumps of grass that broke the thin crust of snow His tired body barely noticed A servant followed leading the priests horse Finally the guard stopped and pulled aside a felt rug door Koja entered and the servant unloaded his belongings Fatigue settling on him the priest tottered over to the pile of rugs and gently collapsed on top of them dropping away into blissful slumber The sun was high over the eastern horizon when Koja awoke to someone shouting outside his tent Koja the Lama envoy of the Khazari come out Koja straightened his sleeprumpled robes and stepped through the tent door Four guardsmen stood outside dressed in the black robes of the khahans bodyguard They wore tall caps of sable the pelts turned insideout so the hide was on the outside The mens braids were bound with silver disks and tassels of blue yarn Long straight swords hung from their belts the silver fittings gleaming in the sunlight Koja squinted and shielded his eyes from the bright glare Yamun Khahan Illustrious Emperor of the Tuigan orders you to appear before him said one stepping forward from the rest Koja sighed and held up his hand for the man to wait then ducked back into the tent Inside he hastily pulled off his dirty robes and rummaged through the wooden chests of clothes flinging shirts and sashes over his shoulder Finally Koja pulled out an orangered silk robe It was the color worn by lamas of his temple the Red Mountain sect He had bought the silk from a Shou trader and had the robe specially made after learning he was going to the council at Semphar In a few moments Koja left his tent and set out for the khahans yurt As he walked along Koja noticed the tents were arranged in rough rows each positioned the same way Why do all the doors face the southeast he asked his escort One of the guards grunted That is the direction where Teylas lives Teylas is your god Koja asked stepping around a patch of mud The guard nodded You have no other gods Teylas is the god of everything There are cham to help him The fellow was far more talkative than others Koja had met Cham Guardians like our mother the Blue Wolf They keep the evil spirits away from a mans yurt Seethere they are The guard pointed to the band of sticklike figures that circled the top of each yurt After that the guard fell silent There was nothing left for Koja to do but trudge along watching in silence They passed through the gate and marched up the hill to the khahans yurt This time no one challenged the priest when he reached the horsetail banner although his escort bowed At the khahans yurt Koja waited outside It did not take long for the priest to be announced A servant pulled up the tent flap and tied the door open letting a little light into the dim interior At the far end of the tent was a raised platform covered with rugs Sitting there on a small stool was Yamun Khahan Below the platform sitting to the side was an older man his mustache wispy with graying hairs The khahan was dressed in formal clothingleather boots dyed red and black a pair of yellow woolen trousers a blue silk jacket embroidered with dragons and a leather coatrobe with broad cuffs and collar of white ermine His cap was low and only slightly pointed the brow a thick band of sable fur From under it hung his braids bound in coils of silver wire Glass beads dangled from the long ends of his mustache For all the grandeur and might Yamun Khahan claimed his yurt was furnished simply The felt rugs that formed the walls were brightly dyed in geometric patterns as was the custom but aside from the dias there was little else in the tent A stack of cushions rested along one wall and an incense burner sat in the middle of the room Oil lamps hung by chains from the ceiling braces which were themselves carved and embellished with silver plaques of scrollwork Behind the khahan was a stand which held his bow and several quivers of arrows The old man in front of Yamun sat at a low table Neatly arranged on it were several pieces of paper an inking stone and a heavy square silver seal Koja guessed the fellow was a scribe Welcome Lama Koja of the Khazari to the tents of Yamun Khahan The khan of the Hoekun and emperor of all the Tuigan people asks you to sit said the khahan in the weary tones of a man bored with protocol A servant scampered from out of the darkness bringing a cushion for Koja A place was set for him in the center of the floor just behind the incense burner Kneeling on the cushion Koja bowed his head to the floor If the yurt you slept in was comfortable I give it to you Yamun offered suppressing a yawn Koja bowed again to Yamun and carefully began the speech he had rehearsed for this formal reception The khahan does me great honors I am only a simple envoy of my prince Knowing that you would attend the council of Semphar he ordered me to carry messages to you from his hand I have brought these with me Koja said pulling two packets from the sleeves of his robe They were large blue envelopes bound with red silk string and closed with the wax seal of Prince Ogandi Koja set the letters on the rugs before the khahan The khahan waved his finger and the scribe picked up the letters Taking these he presented them with two hands his head bowed to the khahan Yamun took the envelopes and studied the seals while the scribe returned to his seat Apparently satisfied that they had not been tampered with Yamun broke the first open and carefully unfolded the sheet Uncertain what languages the Tuigan might understand the letter had been written in both the flowing script of Semphar and the hachured ideograms of Shou Lung Yamun scanned the page and passed it back to the scribe My scribe will read these I have no use for reading the khahan bluntly explained The scribe carefully placed the paper on the writing desk Koja the Lama continued Yamun arching his back to stretch you are the envoy of the Khazari Therefore Ive ordered proper documents prepared for you stating your position and the honors you must be shown These will keep you from being mistaken for a bandit or a spy Yamuns eyes flicked up and down over the priest Show these signs and you will be allowed to pass unmolestedexcept where my word says you will not go No one will refuse you because defying my word is death Yamun waved to the scribe once more who scurried from his table to present Koja with a golden paitzaa heavy engraved plate almost a foot long strung on a red silken cord Taking the paitza Koja studied it closely At the top was the fanciful face of a tiger the seal of the khahan Below it was writing carved in Shou characters Koja read it softly aloud By the power of eternal heaven and by the patronage of great grandeur and magnificence who does not submit to the command of Yamun Khahan that person is guilty and will die Wear it about your neck and do not lose it or you may find yourself in trouble Koja gently hefted the paitza and decided to wear it somewhere else Now priest I must dismiss you There are other things I must do I will consider the words of your prince When the time is ready I will prepare a reply Yamun abruptly ended the meeting turning to the scribe while ignoring the presence of the priest Bowing one last time Koja took his leave After the previous night the formality and shortness of this meeting was jarring Perhaps he thought there was something he didnt understand about Tuigan hospitality Koja returned to his yurt to work on his reports Since leaving Khazari the priest had tried to maintain a careful account of his mission by writing his observations in letters to Prince Ogandi Although Koja had sent a few missives from Semphar he had not had the chance since Pulling out a bundle of sheets the priest began to carefully add the recollections of last night and today to the papers He quickly became engrossed in the work It was dark when Yamun summoned Koja back to his yurt The khahan sat alone on the dais The scribe was seated at his little table A wick floating in a bowl of oil provided the man with light Other lamps were lit casting a dim illumination against the dark Koja was ushered in with little ceremony Sit priest Yamun said dispensing with formalities Koja took his seat on the cushions in the center of the floor No here Yamun pointed at his feet You will look at my hand As you wish Khahan Koja reached into the front of his robe getting his charm pouch Priest will you join me in drink Yamun asked while he watched the Koja rummage through the bag You are most gracious Khahan I will take wine Yamun clapped his hands taking care not to strike his bandage Bring hot wine and kumiss for me Its a better drink than wine he said pointing a finger at Koja Kumiss reminds us of who we are It is our blood But he concluded with a grin it is an acquired taste The servants appeared and poured the drink into silver goblets As they did so Koja carefully unwrapped the bandage on Yamuns hand The skin around the edge of the wound was black and crusty but there was no sign of swelling Already it had started to knit properly Let the wound air Koja advised the khahan Very well Now for the sake of formality read me your princes words Yamun requested Reaching into his robe the khahan produced the letters and tossed them to Koja He leaned forward intent on Kojas words The priest unfolded the sheet and squinted trying to make out the words in the dim light To the gracious lord of the steppe from Prince Ogandi ruler of Khazari son of Tulwakan the Mighty Long have we heard of your people and great are they in their lands Mighty is your valor Greatly it pleases us to have so stalwart a neighbor What does it say Yamun interrupted impatiently tapping his fingertips together Great Lord What does your prince say Tell me Dont read anymore Just tell me Well Koja paused as he scanned the rest of the letter Prince Ogandi offers his hand in friendship hoping that you will enter into peaceful trade with him And then later on he proposes a treaty of friendship and defense And the other letter what does it say Koja unfolded it and scanned through the lines My prince has outlined this proposed treaty for you to consider It calls for recognizing the borders of the Khazari and Tuigan lands He says that Your enemies shall be our enemies Koja stopped to see if the khahan had understood Its a promise to assist each other against attackers He does not threaten war Yamun asked sternly Koja looked at the letter again No Great Lord Does he state that assassins will be sent to slay me Yamun fingered at the baubles in his mustache Koja wonder just what Yamun was getting at Not at all Hmmm Yamun stroked his mustache Then why would someone tell me these things he wondered out loud as his gaze settled on the old scribe The man went pale sweat beading out on his forehead Why would someone tell me lies I did not lie Lord I only read what was there the scribe babbled as he frantically pressed his face into the carpets His voice muffled he continued to plead I swear by the lightning by the might of Teylas I only read what was written I am your faithful scribe One of you has lied and will forfeit his life for it Yamun rumbled looking from the priest to the scribe The prostrate servant began heaving with muffled sobs Koja looked at the letters again baffled by this strange accusation Yamun looked at the two men over his folded hands his mind deep in thought Suddenly the khahan stood knocking the stool over and strode to the doorway of the tent Captain he shouted into the darkness The officer appeared within a second Take this dog out and execute him Now Yamun thrust his finger at the scribe With a shrieking wail the man clutched at the carpets for safety The scribes pathetic screams grew louder as the blackrobed guards approached Koja slid back out of the way of the grimfaced warriors Yamuns visage was fixed with anger and hatred Shut up dog the khahan shouted Guards take him Three soldiers picked up the scribe and carried him from the tent His muffled cries could be heard through the tent walls Yamun waited expectantly The screaming grew frantic and hoarse then there was a dull thud and the screaming stopped Yamun nodded in satisfaction and took his seat Koja realized that he was trembling Lowering his eyes the priest practiced his meditation to regain his composure The captain of the guard pulled the tent flap aside In his hands was a bloodstained bundlea simple leather bag Wordlessly he entered and knelt before the khahan As you ordered so is it done the captain said as he unwrapped the package There in the middle of the cloth was the head of the scribe Well done Captain Take his body and feed it to the dogs Set that he sneered pointing to the head on a lance where everyone can see it It will be done The captain looked at Koja in curiosity then took the head and left Yamun let out a great sigh and looked at the floor Finally he turned to Koja Now priest bandage my hand Still trembling slightly Koja took out his herbs and began to work Mother Bayalun Yamun trotted his horse a sturdy little piebald mare through the camps of his soldiers Alongside him rode Chanar on a pure white stallion From behind came the jingling clatter of reins and hooves as five bodyguards blackrobed men of the elite Kashik followed closely behind It had been days since the audience with the priest from Khazari and Yamun was still reflecting on the events He scowled as he pondered the contents of the envoys letters The prince of the Khazari wanted a treaty between their two nations Yamun didnt know if that was desirable and before deciding he needed to know more about the Khazaritheir numbers strengths and weaknesses The sleeping rabbit is caught by the fox or so went the old saying Yamun had no intention of being lulled to sleep by mere paper Dismissing the topic in his mind Yamun slowed his horse and looked with pride on the endless sea of soldiers tents and campfires This was his army He had organized the tribesmen into arbans of ten men then jaguns of one hundred further still to minghans of one thousand ending finally in the tumen the great divisions of ten thousand men Every soldier had a rank and a place in the army just as Yamun planned Under his command the men of the steppe were transformed from raiding bands into a tightly disciplined army The khahan reined in his horse bringing it to a stop just in front of a small group of soldiers gathered around their fire The entourage with him clattered to a stop too The squad of ten men who sat around the fire leaped to their feet Who is the leader of this arban Yamun demanded tapping his horsewhip on his thigh The khahans horse pranced uneasily agitated by Yamuns energy One man hurriedly ran forward and flung himself to the ground at the mares hooves In the warm spring day the man wore only his woolen trousers and kalat a stained blue tunic trimmed with red A conical bearskin cap decorated with goathide tassels identified the man as a common trooper of Chanars tumen Satisfied with the troopers response the khahan waited for his horse to quiet down Rise brother soldier he said trying to put the nervous trooper at ease Yes Great Lord mumbled the man pushing himself up from the dirt Even sitting upright the man kept his eyes downcast Yamun could tell the man was a tough and seasoned soldier by the large scars on his cheeks Fear not warrior Yamun spoke soothingly Youre not to be punished Ive some questions thats all The commander of your jagun recommended your bravery and skill Whats your fathers ordu Yamun whisked away the flies from his mares mane Illustrious Emperor of the Tuigan my father was born into the Jebe clan The trooper bowed again on completing his words Jebes ordu has many tents and hes served me well in the past Whats your name Hulagu Khahan the trooper answered bowing again Very well Hulagu Stop bobbing up and down and be a soldier The man sat up straighter obedient to the words of his khahan Jebe Khan keeps his ordu to the east near the Katakoro Mountains doesnt he Yes Great Lord in the summertime when the pastures are rich there Have you heard of the Khazari Im told they live in those mountains He stroked the neck of his horse keeping it calm This is true khahan We sometimes take their sheep and cattle the trooper answered with pride Yamun smiled Raiding and rustling were old and honorable traditions among the Tuigan As khahan he could barely keep the different ordus of the Tuigan from stealing each others horses Any Tuigan caught stealing from another was executed on the spot but the law did not apply to nonTuigan Yamun tucked his horsewhip into his boottop Are they easy to raid My father says it was not as hard as raiding the ordus of ArikBoke and Berkuor so he was told my father never did this Trooper Hulagu added hastily remembering the penalties Yamun had set The Khazari arent horsemen and dont chase us very well so it is easy to get away But they live in tents of stone and keep their sheep in pens at night so we could only raid them when they took their flocks out to pasture Are they a brave people Yamun asked dropping his horses reins to let it graze Not as brave as the Jebe the man answered with a trace of boastfulness They would fight but were easy to trick Many times they did not send out scouts and we could fool them by driving horses ahead of us to make our numbers seem much larger The trooper wriggled a little trying to keep his toes warm in the cold mud Yamun stroked the fine beard on his chin Are there many of them The man thought for a bit His eyes glazed as he started imagining numbers larger than twenty Finally the trooper spoke They are not so numerous as the tumens of the khahan nor do they fight as well he said breaking into a big smile at what he thought was his own cleverness Yamun laughed at the mans answer What he really needed as he had known from the start was solid information on who and what the Khazari were like Trooper Hulagus memory was certainly not going to be enough Whats the distance to Khazari he asked Again the man thought although this time Yamun suspected he knew the answer Illustrious Emperor of the Tuigan when I left my ordu to join the magnificent Son of Teylass armies I rode for three weeks but I did not hurry and stopped many days in the yurts of my cousins along the way The trip could be made faster Undoubtedly Yamun said half to himself The squat warlord paused although he already knew what needed to be done Leaning on the pommel of his saddle Yamun turned to General Chanar beside him Chanar Ong Kho this man and his arban are to ride with all haste to the Katakoro Mountains with as many men as you think wise to send I want to know the numbers strengths and weaknesses of the Khazari See that the scouts have fresh horses and passes They must return in five weeks no later Chanar nodded in understanding Just as he was about to go Yamun turned back And send someone from my Kashik who can count Make him their commander Let all who disobey you know this is by the word of the khahan Yamun added the last automatically a formula that signified his orders By your word it shall be done responded Chanar mechanically according to the formula of etiquette Is that all my men are to do the general asked Yamun stopped his horse and stared back at Chanar You General Chanar will ride to the ordu of my son Tomke and observe his camp I want to know if his men are ready Take the men you need and go immediately Teylas will protect you By your word it shall be done Chanar responded The discussion finished Yamun tugged his mounts reins and galloped off The trooper still cowered at the feet of Chanars horse Get going the general bellowed The terrified Hulagu leaped to his feet and scrambled back toward his camp With his boot the trooper roused the men of his arban sending them tumbling after their gear See to the details Chanar ordered an aide nearby With his own preparations to make General Chanar wheeled his horse around and galloped away headed toward his own yurt In his tent Koja brought out his papers and began to make notes of the days events and sights He had only added a few pages since his arrival in Quaraband Looking at the meager letters only reminded him of how little he knew of the khahan Undiscouraged he took up the writing brush and with quick practiced strokes started another letter My lord Prince Ogandi of the Khazari Greetings from your most humble servant Koja envoy to the Tuigan court For two days I have awaited the word of the khahan of the Tuigan There has been no communication from him He has received your offers but gives no sign of his opinion toward a treaty I can do little but wait During this time I have ridden about Quaraband as the Tuigan call this city of tents attempting to learn more about their numbers and their way of life Using the paitza given me by the khahan I have been able to go where I wish with one exceptionthe royal yurt Koja stopped to ink his brush and lay out another sheet of paper He paused before touching the brush to paper again That morning he had gone to Yamuns tent There he was stopped by the Kashik dayguard stationed by the gates Showing his paitza had had no effect on the man and all his protests had been in vain The guard in his black kalat made it clear that Koja was not to be admitted since the priests pass bore only the tiger seal This was apparently the pass used by lowranking officials Koja thought about penning the story down then decided against it Perhaps no one was allowed within the royal palace except by invitation Traveling elsewhere in the camp I had no such difficulty though I have been in the constant company of an armed escort a precaution of the khahan I carefully counted tents making a knot in a string for every ten By now the cord is short twisted with little knots There are more than one hundred knots on the cord and I still have not ridden the extent of the camp The Tuigan are a numerous people O Prince In crafts and arts the people are more than mere barbaric savages They have men skilled in working gold and silver and from the wool of sheep make a wondrously warm and soft fabric called felt At the same time they are among the smelliest and most abhorrent people for their personal habits Koja set aside his brush and pondered what he knew of the Tuigan so far What seemed like ages ago when he had first learned he was to visit the Tuigan Koja had assumed that they were all uncultured savages Chanars appearance at the Council of Semphardirty foulsmelling rude and arrogantcertainly confirmed that impression The ride to Quaraband had been no better The entire force had traveled at a killing pace sometimes covering sixty to eighty miles in a single day He had joined this rank unwashed group at their meals of nearindigestible dried meat and powdered milk curds mixed with water For three weeks the men never changed their clothes It was not a pleasant journey The Tuigan Lord will eat anything nor does this give them indigestion They are great eaters of mutton and horsemeat They eat much game for they are most excellent shots with the bow Mares milk is used at every meal made plain curdled fermented and dried A powder made from the curds is mixed with water or I am told mares blood to make a drink the soldiers use while they travel Koja stopped writing when he realized that his description was incomplete In Quaraband he had finally been exposed to another facet of his hosts To be sure they still seemed to be barbarianscruel dangerous and impulsivebut Koja could no longer say they were simply uneducated and unskilled There was a surprising variety to Tuigan life The first thing he noticed was that not everyone traveled by horseback and lived in yurts Mixed among the tents were households who used great heavy carts to haul their belongings Some families owned carts but still used yurts others had abandoned the domeshaped tents and lived in houses built on their wagons Other carts carried portable forges for the blacksmiths who set up shop along the waters edge These smiths were skilled craftsmen Working with silver they made decorated cups bowls saddle arches buckles pins and an amazing assortment of other ornaments Others worked leather tanning and dying horsehide for all uses The women wove brightcolored cloth of wool and camel hair Armorers were especially prized and the priest had seen many fine examples of their art since he arrived Koja was just about to set these thoughts down when the guard outside summoned him to the door Hurriedly putting the writing instruments away Koja folded the slim sheets and put them in a letter pouch Pouring water from a leather bag the priest rinsed his inking stone and fingers leaving a blue stain on his fingertips At last with what seemed proper dignity and decorum he threw aside the tent flap to see who was there Outside were five soldiers wearing white kalats trimmed with blue the personal guard of the empress of the Tuigan Eke Bayalun Koja noted their presence with a slight nod Empress Eke Bayalun of the royal household requests you come to an audience with her stated the officer of the group identified by the red silk tassels that hung from his cap I am honored by the empresss invitation Koja answered with a bow Judging from the mans tone Koja decided the request was actually an order so there was little to do but accept graciously Gathering his things the priest mounted the horse the guards had brought for him Koja was curious to meet the empress of the Tuigan Eke Bayalun was from what he had learned the only surviving wife of Yamun Khahan She was also his stepmother Apparently Tuigan custom required a son to marry his fathers widowor widowsmostly to ensure the women would be cared for Her full title was Second Empress Eke Bayalun Khadun denoting her status as Yamuns second wife It seemed she took an active interest in the khahans affairs Koja studied the guards she had sent As empress she was allowed her own bodyguards much like Yamuns Kashik troopers Koja noted too that Bayaluns troops must not like the khahans bodyguard they were widely skirting the tents of the Kashik Finally they came to a gate in the stockade one Koja had not seen before They rode through without stopping waved on by the whiterobed guards that stood to either side Inside the palace grounds the escort dismounted and helped Koja from his horse Leaving the horses behind with the soldiers the officer in charge led him through the grounds to a large white yurt Before it stood a banner of white yak tails The officer knelt quickly before this and then led Koja to the door The man pulled the door flap aside and informed the chamberlain that they had arrived There was a delay then the chamberlain returned to usher Koja into the empresss yurt As he entered the priest noticed two rag idols hung over the doorway Near the one on the left was a leather drinking bag by the one on the right a bundle of grain Offerings to protective spirits he guessed This yurt was far more lavish than the khahans spartan tent The chalkwhite walls were hung with patterned silks of red blue yellow and white One section of the yurt was blocked off by a carved wooden screen The rugs on the floor were bright red embroidered in gold and silver with leaflike curls The two tent posts that supported the central frame were carved and painted to resemble what Koja thought were twining dragons and horses At the yurts far side was a square platform no more than a few inches high covered with rugs On the platform was a couchlike bed of carved wood inlaid with seashells Blankets were draped over the curved ends Perched on its edge was a woman Eke Bayalun The second empress was a striking woman far more graceful and attractive than Koja had imagined Knowing her to be Yamuns stepmother Koja thought she would be an old crone her face bound up in wrinkles with blotchy age spots Instead Eke Bayalun was remarkably poised and youthful Her face was only lightly wrinkled at the corners of the eyes and mouth the skin stretched tight over her high cheekbones There it was smooth and flowed with a rich buttery color Unlike the other Tuigan women Koja had seen with their soft round cheeks and broad noses Bayalun had a sharp angular nose and chin both straight and narrow Her eyes too were different more like those of the westerners he had seen at Sempharlacking the fold of eyelid at the outer corner The womans eyes were sharp bright and clear Her lips were thin and tinted with natural color Bayaluns hair was covered with a cowl of white silk gathered high in the back and fanned out to drape behind her shoulders The front of the silk wrapped loosely around the neck and wisps of black and silver hair peeked out from under the cloth Silver earrings set with blue and red stones barely showed behind the fabric Her dress in the style of the Tuigan was highnecked with broad lapels and collar The dress was black silk while the collar was a bright red velvet Over the dress Bayalun wore a long sleeveless felt jacket a jupon decorated with silver coins and silken tassels Rough woolen trousers and hard leather boots peeked out from underneath the layers of clothing A wooden staff topped with a golden fanged face lay across her lap At Bayaluns feet were several neat stacks of paper scrolls each carefully tied with a cord of red or gold Koja startled as he realized that he was rudely staring at the second empress turned his gaze to the other people in the yurt The men sat to the left and the women to the right There were three men on the left side The first sitting slightly out of the way was clearly Bayaluns scribe an old man perhaps ancient who hunched over his little writing table To the scribes left was another old man dressed in robes of faded yellow silk The robes were completely covered with Shou characters This man looked quickly and sharply at Koja as the priest advanced to take his seat Taking his place between the two rows Koja walked past the third man His hair hung in loose greasy hanks and his teeth were crooked and rotten The man was garbed in rattylooking pelts thickly layered over each other Iron hooks bars plates chainlinks and figurines were stitched all across the breast of his robes In his lap he held a large skin drum and a curved drumstick Koja was fairly certain the man was some type of shaman calling on primitive spirits for his powers On the right side of the yurt were ten women Two sat in the front row facing the men and seemed important At the head of the row was an old crone dressed in a warm del the leather garment that served as both coat and robe to the Tuigan Beside and slightly behind the crone was a younger woman dressed in similar clothing She wore the headdress of an unmarried woman a towering cone of wrapped red cloth held in place with tortoiseshell combs and silver pins Long dangling strings of silver coins draped down over her shoulders Koja bowed low as he stood between the two rows of attendants Head lowered he waited for some word from the second empress Welcome Koja of the Khazari she said in a warm and friendly tone You may sit Koja sat making himself as comfortable as possible The second empress does me great honor more than I deserve he said Bayalun smiled in recognition Second empress is not a title I am accustomed to Among my people I am better known as Mother Bayalun or she informed him with a wry smile Widow Bayalun even Bayalun the Hard I prefer Mother Bayalun if only because through me the House of Hoekun is traced Please pardon my ignorance but I have only been here a short time What is the House of Hoekun Is it the same as the Tuigan or is it something different queried Koja He waited attentively for her answer A quick mind You ask questions commented Mother Bayalun as she leaned forward setting the point of her staff on the rugs She studied the priests face intently with her dark deep eyes Raising the tip of her staff she drew a large circle in the thick nap of the felt This is the Tuigan empire Her staff tapped at the circle Are the Hoekun part of the Tuigan Koja asked Mother Bayalun ignored the question Instead she drew several smaller circles inside the first The circles more or less filled the space These are the people of the Tuigan empire These she said stabbing at one of the circles with her staff are the Naican conquered by Burekai my husband before the khahan Bayalun went on to tap four other circles These are the Dalats Quirish Gur and the Commani They were all defeated by the current khahan And this circle she pointed at the last in the center of all is the Tuigan There are many families among the Tuigan Using her staff the empress poked the rug leaving little dents These are the people of the Tuigan There are the Hoekun the Basymats the Jamaqua and many more Each house is named for its founder Ours was Hoekun the Clever son of his mother the Blue Wolf Koja nodded politely though he wasnt sure he understood completely The Blue Wolf A wise spirit She whelped our ancestor in the middle of winter and caused our people to be born Bayalun leaned back and shrugged her shoulders The children of the House of Hoekun are all the sons and daughters of the Blue Wolf This makes the Hoekun the royal family of all the Tuigan I am the oldest of the house so I am called Ekeor MotherBayalun Then your husband before Yamun Khahan was also the khahan Koja noted trying to make sure he grasped everything clearly A scowl knitted Bayaluns brow but she quickly assumed a blank look Burekei was khan of the Hoekun ordu no more It was his son Yamun who was chosen to be the khahan Yamun Khahan was elected He wasnt born to become the khahan Koja asked in surprise He had assumed the khahan was a hereditary rank like that of king or prince All men are born to become what they will Such is the will of Teylas Lord of the Sky she explained playing her fingers up and down the staff When Burekei died Yamun became khan of the Hoekun It was only later after he conquered the Dalats that the families named him great prince of all the Tuigan Bayalun crossed her feet and adjusted her seat But I did not invite you here to answer all your questions envoy although they have been amusing She gave him a slight mocking smile and watched to see what kind of reaction her gentle barb would bring Koja became redfaced Accept my apologies Second Empress he meekly responded bowing his head slightly Please call me Mother Bayalun the empress chided Sitting back in her seat Bayalun carefully set the staff down by her feet You say you are a lama of the Red Mountain she began casually What teachings do you follow The lamas of the Red Mountain live by the words of the Enlightened One who taught us how to reach peace and perfect oblivion We seek to banish our passions so we can understand the teachings of the Enlightened One He paused waiting for some sign of understanding Bayalun watched him closely but gave no indication that she understood Koja continued If I drink tea and I like tea my life will be ruled every day by the desire for tea and I will not know anything else Every day I will think about my cup of tea and will miss what is happening around me The priests hands mimed holding a cup of tea Only after we no longer savor life can we truly feel everything life has to offer Koja tried to keep his explanation simple not wanting to confuse his hostess with the complexities of Red Mountain theology Judging from the shaman beside him the Tuigan were not all that familiar with sophisticated philosophical teachings Mother Bayalun squinted at him I heard it said you followed Furo the Mighty Isnt he the god of the Red Mountain Temple But today you talk of the Enlightened One Do you follow the teachings of one and worship the other Koja scratched at the stubble on his skull His simple explanation was getting more complex We know it is a truth that Furo the Mighty is a divine agent of the Enlightened One So you practice the teachings of the Enlightened One but pray to Furo to intercede on your behalf Yes Mother Bayalun Koja marveled at the astuteness of her questions He is like the wind all about us Felt but not touched heard but not spoken moving but unmovable always present but always unseen quoted Bayalun her eyes closed in concentration Koja stared at her in amazement too dumbfounded for words That is from the Yanitsava the Book of Teachings he whispered And youre surprised that I know it she chuckled I too have spent my life learning the teachings of wise men These worthies have been my instructors She waved a hand toward the men who sat down the row from Koja This is Aghul Balai of the TsuTsu a people close to the border of Shou Lung she said introducing the thin man in the mystical robes For many years he studied in Shou Lung learning the secrets of Chung Tao the Way The wizened man pressed his palms together and bowed slightly to Koja While at the temple Koja had heard a little about Chung Tao It was powerful within the Shou empire far to the east It was said that the emperor of the Jade Throne himself followed its teachings Koja had been taught its teachings were wrong and had heard many evil stories about its practices To Koja the mystic suddenly looked sinister and dangerous This other continued Bayalun pointing to the furclad man is Fiyango Through him we are able to speak with the spirits of the land and our ancestors and learn much good advice The shaman whose age Koja found impossible to place smiled a toothless smile at him And she concluded the second empress tapping her staff in front of the old crone is Boryquil and this is her daughter Cimca Boryquil has the gift to see things as they are and things as they should be She knows the ways of the kaman kulda the dark spirits that come from the north With my eyes I can see them with my nose I can smell them cackled the hag reciting an old ritualistic formula Her lungs labored from the exertion With each gasping breath her necklace clacked and rattled Peering at it from across the aisle Koja saw that it was a leather cord strung with broad flat bones Each bone was covered in redinked script So you can see Koja of the Red Mountain I have surrounded myself with people of useful skills They advise me and they teach me Bayalun stopped and quickly wet her lips Aghul hopes to convert me to Chung Tao Fiyango worries that I will forget the spirits of earth sky and water while Boryquil protects my tent from evil spirits Of course she added softly not that any spirit could enter this area She touched the finial on her staff Tell me Koja of the Khazari are you here to teach me the secrets of the Red Mountain Koja paused for a bit trying to think of an appropriate response Finally he answered I was never the best student of my masters and so I only learned a little from them These were only small things in the teachings of Furo I have traveled instead hoping to aid others through the services of the Enlightened One Koja didnt lie he wasnt the best disciple but his skills were more than he allowed I thought all of you sat in your temple and meditated Bayalun commented brushing a wisp of hair from her eyes The shaman to Kojas right broke into a fit of coughing Bayalun pursed her lips and waited until he was done If you are a teacher you must stay and instruct me in the ways of your temple Koja swallowed uncomfortably unwilling to offend the second empress with a direct refusal He was not here however to teach even if it might spread the belief of Furo to these nonbelievers I will certainly be happy to teach you of our ways while I am here illustrious empress but I must carry messages back to my prince in Khazari He bowed slightly as he spoke I understand Bayalun said relenting She leaned back with a sigh stroking her eyebrows carefully Koja detected a note of disappointment in her voice So when you summon him does Furo lay waste to your enemies Koja started at the boldness of the question It is said Mother Bayalun that he is both wondrous and terrible but we do not summon him We live to serve our god not to have him come at our beck and call A tone of chastisement unavoidably crept into the lamas voice I see said Mother Bayalun turning away from Koja At this time the interview is over It is our misfortune that you are unable to stay and instruct us But I am sure your pressing duties need your attention You may leave Koja bit at the inside of his lip frustrated by his own indiscretion The chamberlain came forward and touched Koja on the shoulder motioning the priest to rise Koja hoisted himself to his feet and backed out of the tent bowing as he went The priest bewildered by the strange meeting was led back to his waiting horse Only one man from his original escort remained The two of them rode back toward his tent once again following the roundabout way they had taken earlier Why do we go this way It is shorter that way Koja said pointing along a route that would lead them past the front of the royal enclosure and Yamuns bodyguard Orders Oh the lama answered The whitekalated guard trotted his shaggymaned horse forward expecting the priest to follow along Koja inattentive to his riding urged his horse forward giving it what he thought was a gentle kick The mare set off at a full gallop Koja was slammed forward into his saddle and then toppled backward barely keeping his hold as the horse leaped over a cooking fire The lama only had time to glimpse a flash of startled faces Panicked he dropped the reins and used both hands to cling to the saddle arch There was another hard jolt and his feet flew from the stirrups Haii shouted the guard wheeling his horse around to pursue The man leaned forward onto the neck of his pony slashing its haunches with his threethonged knout Haii Haii he cried trying to warn everyone out of his path The guard could see Koja bouncing and tumbling about on his saddle feet flying in the air Stop Stop Koja screamed to his horse as it took a tight turn past an oxcart He managed to knot one hand into the ponys mane while his other arm flailed about The horses hooves clattered and thundered pounding over the icy ground and meager grass Koja tossed to the right lurched forward cracked his spine in a hard jolt against the saddle then felt his legs fly backward almost up over his head The wind whipped at his robes as the pony galloped onward From behind Koja there was a chorus of shouts cries and yells Suddenly a mans scream came from in front of him The horse answered the scream and reared almost throwing Koja off its back The mares breath was labored coming in snorting pants There was a sharp crack as its hooves hit the ground The jolt snapped the priest forward flipping his body over the front of the saddle one hand still tangled in the mares mane In an instant Koja slammed to the ground thrown completely over the head of the panting steed a hank of mane in his hand As he hit Kojas head struck a stone Haiihaiihai the breathless guard hoarsely shouted as he leaped from the saddle of his stillmoving steed He sprinted over to where the runaway horse pranced Under its hooves was the priest a huddled form of tangled robes From the nearby tents ran the blackgarbed men of the khahans guard Yamun paced back and forth along the dusty streambed it was the only action that could contain his frustration and anger Several times he stopped to slash an offending tuft of grass with his bloodstained knout At one end of his pace was the guardsman of the second empress Kojas escort spreadeagled on the ground The man lay staked out on his back his head pressed into the dirt by a cangue a heavy Yshaped yoke that was lashed to his neck by twisted thongs The guardsman had been stripped naked and was bleeding from several lash marks At the other end of Yamuns stride was a pallet bearing the unconscious priest Huddled around him were three shamans wearing their ritual masks A piece of white cloth set with a silver bowl of milk and bloody sheep bones was spread at the head of the pallet Encircling everyone was a wall of Kashik dayguards their backs turned so that they faced away from Yamun and the shamans forming a living wall A strong wind whipped their kalats about their legs In the distance the smoke of Quaraband curled over the dim shapes of the tents Yamun stopped at the prisoner Why did old Bayalun summon the Khazari he demanded towering over the bound man The prisoner choking from a parched throat barely gurgled a reply Infuriated Yamun whipped him with the knout leaving more bloody wounds Why did she summon him IIdont know the guardsman rasped out What did they talk about The guard gasped as Yamun struck him again I did not hear Disgusted Yamun strode to the other end of the little compound where the shamans worked Will he live It is very difficult Great Prince spoke one of the three He wore a crow mask and his thin creaky voice echoed hollowly from it Horsemask and Bearmask kept to their work I dont care Give me an answer Yamun snapped His gods are different from ours Khahan It is hard to know if our healing spells will have power over him We can only try Yamun grunted Then youd better try very hard He turned to resume his pacing The wall of Kashik parted to allow a mounted rider to enter The man a commander of a minghan in the Kashik slid quickly off his horse ran to Yamun and knelt before the khahan Get up and report Yamun ordered I come from the tents of the Mother Bayalun as you ordered Great Lord And what did she have to say Mother Bayalun says she only wanted to learn more of the world the officer quickly answered as he looked toward the prisoner on the ground Yamun gripped his knout with both hands And whats her excuse for the guards According to her the orders she gave were not followed She commanded the guards to escort the priest to and from his tent and to make sure that he was not hurt the commander explained She ordered an arban of men to go as escort but they did not obey her orders Then you must ride back and tell her to choose a punishment for the nine that deserted their posts Yamun ordered He impatiently scuffed at the ground with his toe She has anticipated your desire and has already given her judgment They are to be sewn into the skins of oxen and sunk into the river as is by custom Shes clever and quick She hopes this will appease me Yamun pulled at his mustache as he thought it over Her judgment will do Still I want you to go back and tell her Im not satisfied For letting this happen she must reduce the size of her bodyguard Ill set the numbers when I return Yes Khahan Surely the second empress will be angry Lord Might she do something dangerous The officer had heard much of Bayaluns powers I dont need to please her Shell accept it because Im the khahan Yamun said confidently He turned and walked over to his captive And did she say anything about him Yamun asked pointing at the man on the ground Seeing as he is within your grip she allows you to deal with him as you want Yamun looked down on the man The fellows eyes were wide waiting for word from the khahan He did not desert Khahan the officer noted True He can live but The khahan paused thinking He failed in his duties Fetch men and stones Crush one ankle so he cannot ride again Let all who disobey you know that this is by the word of the khahan By your word it shall be done answered the commander Taking his horse he left the circle to see to the arrangements The sound of the drum and flute brought Yamuns attention back to the shamans The droning melody of their chant was just ending when he came back to them Taking their horsetail wands the shamans sprinkled the still body of the priest with milk and then stepped away from the pallet Well demanded Yamun only to be hushed by Crowmask Wait we will know in a little while The shamans voice echoed from inside the mask The three squatted down on their haunches Yamun stood behind them fiddling with his knout Finally his patience could take no more and he resumed his pacing After several minutes Yamun heard a cough He turned and strode back to the pallet Koja was struggling to prop himself up on one elbow The shamans clustered around their masks pushed up from their faces They fussed over the priest pushing him back down each time he weakly tried to sit up Crowmask turned to Yamun He lives Illustrious Khahan The spirits of the Sky God Teylas have favored him with their blessing Good commented Yamun stepping past the man He looked down into Kojas wan face Dried blood still caked the back of his skull although the wound magically healed had already knit Well envoy of the Khazari want to go riding He laughed at his own joke while Koja winced in pain at the thought One of the shamans tugged at the khahans sleeve Gently Great Lord He is still very weak Yamun grunted in acknowledgment and squatted down beside the sickbed He waved the shamans back so he could be alone You live Koja nodded weakly tried to raise his head and fell back in pain Whatwhere His questions drifted off Youre outside Quaraband I had you brought here so the shamans could work their spells on you Koja took a deep breath and composed his thoughts What happened to me You were thrown from your horse My guard brought you in almost dead It took a little time but the shamans healed your wounds Yamuns legs were getting stiff so he rocked gently from side to side to stretch The men who failed you have been punished he added assuming the priest would demand justice without delay A cloud of confusion swirled in Kojas eyes only in part from dizziness Why have you done this Remembering his manners he rephrased the question Why has the khahan Illustrious Emperor of the Tuigan come here to see to the health of this insignificant one You have bestowed great favor on me Yamun scratched his neck thinking of how to explain it The reasons for his actions seemed obvious to Yamun so he assumed that those same reasons were clear to everyone Why Youre a guest in my yurt It wouldnt be good if you died while you were here People would say my tents were plagued by evil spirits The khahan paused and smiled Besides what would your prince think if I sent him a message saying Please send another priest the first one died I dont think he would be pleased Yamun picked up a pebble and rolled it between his fingers And now Yamun said softly Ive saved your life The warlord tossed the rock aside Koja was at a loss for words I am unable to repay you for this Great Lord he whispered at last A shiver ran through his body His chest felt tight and restricted Yamun smiled broadly the scar on his lip giving it a leering quality His eyes remained squinted and hard Envoy of the Khazari I need a new scribe The last one proved unreliable Koja gulped painfully Unreliable He forgot his loyalties Koja remembered the bloody head and Yamuns quick justice You mean He told me what others wanted me to hear Yamun interrupted So who do you serve Koja hesitated in fear then swallowed and answered Prince Ogandi of the Khazari Great Lord He closed his eyes waiting for the blow Hah Good Yamun bellowed If youd betray your proper lord to serve me what kind of loyalty could I expect He slapped his thigh in satisfaction But now you will do your prince service by serving me Great Khan I Yamun cut off his protests Your prince ordered you to learn more about me and my people didnt he Yes but how did you know Fearful that his letters had been found Koja struggled and finally managed to sit up Because thats what Id have you do Now as my scribe youll be very close to me and have the chance to learn many things wont you Yamun scratched at his chest Yes Koja answered hesitantly Good Its decided Yamun stood once again rubbing the soreness out of his back The khahan turned and looked toward the tents of Quaraband Youve met the second empress What do you think of her She is strongwilled responded Koja picking his words carefully Yamun snorted She tried to get something from you I see Remember she will never give up and she is powerful Most of the wizards and shamans heed her words I will remember As my scribe Yamun continued still looking away she may seek your favor Look over there He turned and pointed across the small circle Koja looked where Yamun pointed and saw the bound prisoner Up to now the man had been mostly silent except for slight whimpers of pain Koja was barely able to recognize him as the rider from his escort Yamun raised his hand signaling to his guard Two men stepped from the ranks Each carried a large flat stone Seeing them the prisoner began to scream and beg for mercy Impassive to his cries the men set to work With a quick cut of the knife the guards slashed the bindings that held one leg One man quickly grabbed the victims leg twisting the ankle upward while the other Kashik slid one stone underneath The prisoner still screaming tried to kick free but he was held fast The second guard raised his stone high over his head Stop them Khahan Koja cried out as he realized the guard was about to smash the stone down The effort it took to shout caused him to fall into a wracking fit of coughing Hold Yamun commanded The Kashik lowered the stone he held over his head Why should they stop Yamun demanded of Koja once the coughing passed This man has done nothing You cannot blame him for my accident Koja protested Why not Yamun countered He failed to protect you Therefore he must be punished At least he will live His comrades were drowned His mind already weak from shock Koja was amazed at Yamuns words It is not his fault that I was hurt I will not have him harmed the priest finally said with conviction Exhausted he fell back on the pallet Yamun sucked on his cheek as he listened to the priest Do you request his life the burly warlord asked His life Yes I do Koja answered as he lay on his back Yamun looked over to the prisoner The man was watching them his eyes filled with fear and expectation Very well priest According to custom I give him to you hes your slave His name is Hodj If he commits any crime youll be punished That too is our custom I understand this Koja assured Yamun closing his eyes Good Now as for Bayalun shell assume that youre loyal to me She hates me he said matteroffactly and so shell hate you Always remember that Im all that stands between her wrath and you Yamun signaled the guards to release Hodj and then left to find his horse Koja watched the khahan ride off as the bearers came and hoisted his pallet onto their shoulders All the way back to Quaraband the priest silently said his prayers calling on Furo to protect him until he saw his home again Lightning For four days Koja lived in a special white yurt raised on the outskirts of Quaraband just outside the boundary of the magicdead lands Here he stayed on his pallet resting and regaining his strength Once a day the shamans came and unfurled their white sheet and set out their offerings to Teylas Beating their drums and howling out chants they cast spells to heal and fortify him Every day after they left Koja would sink into deep concentration praying to Furo for strength and forgiveness Though he told no one the priest was mortified fearful that Furo and the Enlightened One would shun him for having accepted the healing of another deity By the fourth day the shamans were marveling at Kojas speedy recovery and priding themselves on the efficacy of their spells To their minds Teylas clearly favored them by accomplishing the healing of this foreign priest The shamans told the khahan of this wondrous progress explaining that the priest must somehow be special Four days also gave Koja time to learn his new servants qualities Although Hodj was a slave Koja refused to treat him like one and instead gave him the liberties and confidence of a trusted servant Hodj responded to this and seemed to care for his new master The first morning Hodj made tea in the Tuigan stylethick with milk and salt Koja almost choked and a teabrewing lesson immediately followed Thereafter Hodj brewed tea Khazaristylethick with butteralthough he made an awful face as he set it out for his master While recovering Koja had little to do with his days but listen Hodj rarely spoke but the shamans were another matter Their lengthy conversations usually centered on beliefs but ranged across a variety of subjects Soon Koja had enough new information to add to his letters He lit the oil lamp that sat on his small desk and unfolded a thin sheet of paper the page softly crackling as he smoothed it out on the top of the desk The white paper appeared straw yellow in the dim circle of light from the lamp Taking up his brush Koja began to write in tight controlled strokes The khahan claims to command more than one hundred thousand men in four different armies I know too little to say if he is a boastful man Three of his armies are led by his sons The fourth commander is Chanar Ong Kho He is a vain and proud man There are also many lesser khans among the Tuigan Most of these I have had no chance to meet The khahan has a wife the Second Empress Eke Bayalun his own stepmother She surrounds herself with sorcerers and holy men and seems to have sway over the shamans of the people That she does not love her husband is clear and her feelings may be even stronger There is some chance that overtures to her would drive a wedge between the khahan and his wizards Having written everything he could Koja was left with nothing to do but brood In particular he was worried how to get his letters to Prince Ogandi In Semphar trusted messengers carried them by the Silk Road to Khazari Here his only choice was the khahans riders and Koja certainly did not trust them with his messages He wished he could send the letters safely back but that was not possible However there was little Koja could do since he had to stay until the khahan at least gave some answer to Ogandis offer Am I doing the right thing he worried in serving as Yamuns scribe in the meantime After four days of rest Koja was fit enough to get about He was still weak but Yamun pressed him to return to the royal compound The khahan needed his scribe So reluctantly Koja returned to Quaraband and assumed his duties as the khahans court scribe There was not much to these duties mostly sitting quietly to the side during the khahans audiences noting any orders or proclamations Yamun made It was quiet work indeed so much so that Koja learned little more about the khahan than he already knew Two weeks of that drudgery passed before anything of note happened It was very late at night almost midnight and the three men remaining in the royal yurt were almost exhausted Yamun sat halfsprawled on his throne drinking wine and resting Koja still only two weeks at his new duties yawned as he patiently worked with a pile of papers In the darkness at the side of the yurt was one of Yamuns nightguards In his black kalat the man almost disappeared into the gloom He sat still trying to remain bright and alert knowing he would be beaten if he fell asleep His writing table pulled up in front of him Koja sat transcribing the days judgments and pronouncements As he worked the priest stopped to listen to the hammering roars of thunder and staccato pounding of rain against felt The thunderstorm raging outside made him start each time a new crash shook the yurt Such storms were the distant battles of the god Furo against the evil spirits of the earthat least that was what he had been taught Still this storm the first since Koja had arrived in Quaraband was greater than any the priest had ever heard before All day the sky had been gray promising a storm of swelling power While the khans had watched the sky fearfully the khahan had been edgy waiting for the rain to come In the early evening the storm broke Abruptly Yamun dismissed the khans and the servants sending them out into the downpour Since then Yamun had been sitting drinking wine and occasionally issuing orders but his tension had not subsided By this hour the khahan moved wearily and his temper was short Yamun swallowed a gulp of wine from a chased silver cup Write out this order scribe he said brusquely Koja neatly set aside the notes he had been working on and laid out a fresh sheet of paper His vision was blurred by the long hours he worked His tired fingers dropped the writing brush splattering the drops of black ink over the clean white page Youll have to be stronger than that scribe Yamun growled irritated with the delay Make yourself tougher Youll have days and nights with no sleep when we begin to march March Great Khan In two weeks of taking down proclamations Koja had yet to hear any mention of the armies of the khahan going on campaign Yes march You think I intend to sit here forever waiting on the pleasure of otherslike your Prince Ogandi In time I must march the stocky man snapped back Soon the pastures here will be gone and then we must move Great Khahan Koja pleaded as he rearranged the papers would it not be easier for you to find another scribe Surely one of your people somebody stronger could do the job Whats this You dont like being my scribe The khahan glowered over his cup at Koja his foul mood getting worse No its not that Koja stuttered Its I am not brave I am not a soldier he blurted out Terrified he turned his attention to the sheets in front of him mumbling Besides I never thought there was so much work I mean You thought we were ignorant and didnt know how to keep records Yamun interrupted in cold tones Koja despaired All his attempts to explain his weaknesses were only making things worse Yamun slid forward out of his seat bringing himself close to Koja I cant write and I cant read so you think Im a fool I know the value of these He grabbed up a handful of Kojas papers from the little writing desk Great kings and princes all rule by these slips of paper Ive seen the papers sent out by the emperor of Shou Lung I too am an emperor Im not some little prince who goes from tent to tent talking to all his followers I am the khahan of all the Tuigan and I will be more Koja looked in silence at the khahan startled by the outburst Still the skepticism must have shown on the priests face Yamun heaved to his feet splashing wine over the carpets You doubt me Teylas has promised it to me Listen to him out there he shouted pausing long enough for Koja to hear a particularly loud thunderclap Thats his voice Those are his words Most people live in fear of him They pray and scream afraid hell call them to the test But Im not afraid Hes tested me and I still live Wobbling slightly from the drink Yamun walked toward the door Hes calling to me now Today Koja stayed at his seat trying to make sense of Yamuns ranting The nightguard however dashed over to the doorway and flung himself down on the carpet Great Prince he entreated do not go outside I beg it of you There has never been a storm like this It is an evil omen Teylas has released his spirits upon us If you go out they will try to snatch you away Teylas is angry See Yamun shouted across the yurt at Koja They all fear the storms the might of Teylas These are my soldierschildren Move guardsman he ordered turning his attention back to the cowering man I dont fear the wrath of Teylas After all I am the khahan My ancestor was born the child of Teylas and the Blue Wolf Arrogantly Yamun strode past the kneeling man and unfastened the door flap The heavy cloth immediately flew open with a crack Cold rain blasted through the open doorway swept in by the powerful wind Foul ashes swirled up in choking clouds from the braziers The warm air suddenly drained away There That is the might of Teylas Yamun bellowed motioning toward the storm Come scribe since you dont believe he talks to me Please Great Lord Koja begged shouting over the wind stay inside No Youll come and see because Ive ordered it He strode over to Koja grabbed him by the shoulder and halfdragged him to the doorway With an unceremonious push Yamun shoved the priest into the blasting rain Koja stumbled and slipped sliding down into the cold mud Rain splashed into the slop and splattered thickly against him A lance of lightning cut jaggedly through the night sky illuminating the entire horizon In the brief stab of light Koja saw the dark form of Yamun standing over him face to the sky mouth wide open The light lasted only an instant and then the world was plunged back into darkness Yamuns strong hand grabbed the priests robes and hauled him out of the muck The two men set out struggling and sliding their way down the slope They walked through the icy mud out the gate and past yurts until they reached the horse pens outside the capital Wind and rain lashed against their faces Rivulets ran from Yamuns hair into his mustache dribbling into his mouth Huge drops ran down all sides of Kojas shaved head washing away the gobs of mud Teylas shouted Yamun spitting water between each word Here I am Listen to me A distant bolt of lightning dimly lit the steppe casting weird shadows over the pair The wind swept the rain away from their faces for a moment and then whipped it back again The hollow rumble of the distant bolt barely carried over the wind He listens Yamun said confidently letting go of Kojas shoulder Suddenly unsupported the priest stumbled backward and fell floundering along an unexpectedly steep part of the bank Oblivious to everything Yamun strode forward until Koja could barely see the older mans bulky silhouette Splashing through pools of foul muddy water Koja did his best to catch up Finally the priest fell back into the mud exhausted from stumbling and slipping in pursuit of the khahan Occasional flashes of lightning had guided Koja but now he had lost sight of Yamun Horses screamed and whinnied somewhere nearby their shrill cries rising over the rattling rain Koja pushed himself out of the mud and splashed off in the direction of the noise Teylas Yamuns voice came from somewhere off to the priests left Khahan Koja shouted hoping Yamun would hear him A stroke of lightning almost overhead flooded the sky with light and thunder Though his eyes hurt from the light Koja could see Yamun off to the left Around him were the shadowy shapes of horses rearing and prancing in panic Yamun Khahan he shouted There was no answer The lightning illuminated the ground again as if in response to Kojas shouts In the moment of light he saw Yamun arms stretched to heaven at the center of one of the horse corrals The rain formed streaks of silver all around him Determined Koja plunged forward into the darkness His feet squished into the mud and threatened to slip out from under him at any second Rainwater dripped down his eyebrows blurring his sight His robes sodden and filthy sagged and pulled on his frame Kojas shin smashed against something hard and solida fence Shocked by the pain the lama tried to hop back on one foot then lost his balance Both feet shot out from under him kicking into the air He sat in the muck at the foot of the corral fence rubbing away the shooting streaks of pain that started at his shin and ran up his leg Teylas listen powerful rule Yamuns voice floated in snatches over the howling wind Koja peered through the fence He was close enough to see into the corral now although he still could not make out anything clearly Shielding his eyes from the rain Koja peered through the horses legs straining to see Yamun The dim form of a man standing all alone was barely visible to Koja The mares and stallions had all moved as far from him as possible pressing their bodies against the fence They stamped and kicked their eyes wild with fear Take my offering of thanks Teylas I have united my people but with or without you I must conquer Yamun shouted Koja heard the words clearly as the wind dropped away to nothing The rain pelted down in straight sheets the thick drops deprived of their driving force Koja could see Yamun more clearly now The khahan stood with his feet planted widely apart arms akimbo head tilted to the sky He paid no mind to the rain as it pounded against his face His clothes were plastered wetly to his body but the khahan didnt care He stood still waiting There was a dazzling burst of light as the storm renewed its fury Before the glare had died away there was another stroke of lightning closer and brighter than the first It was followed by another then another and another The explosions of light became continuous first from the east then west north and south The rumble of thunder grew louder and more shattering until it was a continuous barrage The whinnies of the horses became screams of terror piercing over the bass rolls of thunder Koja trembling in fear clapped his hands over his ears and sank down as close to the ground as he could The posts of the corral thudded and shook as the panicked horses reared and lashed out with their hooves Even though the sky was bright Koja could barely see the khahan through the flailing hooves but the man was unmoved by the pandemonium around him Just as Koja felt the storm was at its height a luminous ball of sparkling blue swirled around Yamun illuminating him clearly It crackled and sizzled a leaping electrical fire Miniature bolts arced from the center scorching and snapping as they hit the ground At its heart Yamun stood unaffected by the charged flame Koja sat dumbfounded Then it dawned on him that the khahan might be in danger Great Lord he shouted over the roaring storm Yamun Khahan the priest shouted again cupping his hands to add more volume to his voice In response a spark arced from the khahan and hurtled toward Koja Flinching Koja threw himself aside as the charge lazily flew past him It hit the ground behind him and exploded in a shower of muck The force of the blast knocked him forward into the fence driving the air from his lungs Koja sagged against the corral stunned More sparks began flying from Yamun drifting out over the corral As each ball of lightning detached itself the radiance enclosing the khahan diminished slightly The horses went into a frenzy galloping and wheeling to avoid the drifting sparks The fence too high to jump penned them in There was a sizzling pop and a scream of equine pain The steeds redoubled their efforts The fence wobbled and banged Koja slid back in the mud as hooves flailed just in front of his face but the fence held firm There was another frenzied whinny and pop followed by a third With each the cries of the horses grew a little less Terror took hold of Koja driving him with uncontrollable energy He had to get away get to safety Panting the lama crawled away from the corral dragging himself across the raindrenched ground Behind him the brilliant glow spread from the corral then began to fade The wind and rain drowned out the noises behind him Finally spent he collapsed like a rag doll unable to move any farther As Koja lay there the wind began to drop away and the howling rage subsided The rain changed from a hammerlike pelting to a slower downpour The water was still icy and rivers of muck ran into the folds of his robe Kojas body was chilled to its core He clung to the ground trembling as the lightning and thunder diminished Scribe Whered you go Yamuns voice carried easily to Koja Here Koja called weakly raising his head from the mud Panting he got to his feet I am here Great Khan Wherever that is he added quietly With the storm gone it was too dark to see far Come here then ordered the khahan He sounded unharmed by the storm Koja set off in direction of Yamuns voice He could only hope he was headed the right way Great Lord where are you This way came the answer Koja stumbled along until he found the corral The fence was still standing but the pen was silent Following the fence around the priest came to the gate Waiting on the other side was Yamun Khahan unhurt although he wavered unsteadily Spying Koja he said Let us go offering no explanation Koja nodded automatically concentrating on the pen It was empty there were no horses living or dead The lama looked at Yamun startled and then back into the corral trying to see any sign of the horses or any marks left by the glittering blue fire There were no steeds and the mud was so churned up that it was impossible to tell what had happened The fence showed no scorching or damage from the sparks It was as if nothing had occurred What happened Koja asked in amazement Come on We go Yamun said as he stepped through the gate He moved slowly with exaggerated care His stiffness could have been caused by the late hour or the lightning It was impossible for Koja to tell Koja remained insistent What happened Yamun guided the priest by the elbow firmly squeezing it as they walked along By now the wind was only a chilly spring breeze and the freezing drops of rain had given way to a fine drizzle I talked with Teylas my father the Lord of the Sky Koja stared at Yamun believing him possessed or victim of some demented illusion Perhaps Yamun meant it only figuratively he decided Many people he knew talked to various gods and never received an answer Lamas and wandering priests were the only ones he knew of who could contact the fearsome powers of the outer planes and expect some kind of reply Yamun noticed Kojas skeptical stare I talked with Teylas The khahans voice was filled with conviction Koja didnt say anything There wasnt anything he could say that wouldnt sound patronizing or obsequious He slogged up the muddy slope alongside Yamun in pained silence You were glowing he finally said Was I I can never see what happens Youve done this before Koja sputtered Of course Teylas demands his offerings The khahan waded through a wide puddle But youre not hurt Yamun stepped over a fallen cooking pot Why would Teylas hurt me Im the Illustrious Emperor of the Tuigan and a son of the Blue Wolf Koja cocked his head at that trying to decide if Yamun was serious or playing some grotesque joke Teylas will not strike down his own clan Yamun splashed through the mud not breaking his stride Then what happened to the horses the lama finally asked Teylas took them As Yamun spoke his breath fogged the air The temperature was dropping quickly in the wake of the storm What Yamun stopped walking and turned to face Koja The khahans shoulders sagged with exhaustion but his face especially his eyes were still vibrant The horses now serve Teylas in his realm Dont you make sacrifices to your god You sacrificed them Teylas took them I didnt touch them Yamun pointed out Flaming blue sparks flew from your fingers Koja said explaining what he saw That was the power of Teylas Yamun replied He turned and resumed walking toward the Great Yurt They continued on in silence through Quaraband At last they returned to the door of the royal yurt Yamun threw open the flap and was about to step inside when Koja stopped him Please wait Great Lord Koja blurted barely observing proper courtesy Yamun stopped in the doorway looking back over his shoulder What did Teylas tell you Koja asked bowing slightly as he spoke Yamun looked at the priest A small sardonic smile crossed his face He He what Illustrious Emperor of the Tuigan Koja prompted unable to suppress his curiosity Yamun looked slowly at the sky and saw the starlight visible through the thinning clouds He showed me the entire world priest from the great water in the east to lands of the west I saw Shou Lung and this Cormeer you spoke of The khahan eyes blazing turned back to the priest yet seemed to focus on something farther away Green lands and forests wailing to be conqueredand all I have to do is reach out and take them Koja stepped back as Yamun spoke The khahans voice was slowly growing as the warlord saw his vision once again unfold before his eyes Teylas promised you these things Koja ventured fearfully Teylas promises nothing He only showed what I could have Its up to me to take it Yamun answered coldly The priests question dimmed the fire in Yamuns eyes I will be emperor of the world The world is large and has many emperors Yamun Khahan Koja pointed out The priest shivered in his wet robes Then Ill conquer them and theyll be the slaves of my khans Yamun leaned slightly against the doorframe of the yurt And youll tell the story of my life What Koja gasped in astonishment You will write the history of my rule I will be a great emperor As my historian you will be honored by many Yamun stepped inside the yurt and Koja followed him still arguing ButbutI am just an envoy Great Lord Surely there must be someone better The nightguard the same man who was in the yurt when they left ran up to the door and dropped to one knee alongside the khahan Great Khan he said in surprised relief You live I will tell my brothers that you have safely returned Youll stay until I dismiss you Yamun countered as he walked past Koja of Khazari you will write the history of my lifestarting from right now No one else will do Great Lord I serve Prince Ogandi It would not be right Koja hurried across the yurt I dont care Youll write it because I need youwho else would write the truth Mother Bayalun Her wizards I wouldnt trust them My generals Theyre like methey dont know this magic of writing You He wagged his finger at Koja You I trust And that is why I choose you Lord Yamun I am very flattered but you barely know me I have a responsibility to my prince I cannot serve you Koja realized he was knotting his fingers Youre in my tent in my land You will do what I say Yamun commanded He began unwrapping the wet sash from around his waist And if Prince Ogandi bids me otherwise asked Koja as he nervously squeezed the water from his cuffs Then I will deal with your prince Yamun spoke in slow measured words Im loyal to Khazari Koja pressed his throat getting dry with tension It doesnt matter I trust you Theres no more discussion to be had of this Yamun tossed his wet sash aside and settled himself on his throne Koja rubbed his head in frustration He was stymied In desperation he tried another ploy Isnt there a saying of your people about a man who tells the truth Yamun looked about for his wine cup A man who tells the truth should have one foot in the stirrup he quoted Its good advice You should remember it Koja finally gave up and spoke his mind I do not want to be your chronicler Yamun Khahan I know Then why do you make me do it Why do you need a biographer Because Teylas revealed that I should Yamun said testily as he pulled at one of his sodden boots But why What good would I do you This is no longer amusing scribe There will be no more argument Yamun snapped his voice rising in volume You will write the history of my great deeds because I am the khahan of the Tuigan and I say you will Every king and every emperor has someone to make songs about them You will write mine Now leave until you are called for With a jerk Yamun pulled the boot off and threw it aside Stiffly Koja walked out of the tent giving only a slight bow and turning his back to the khahan upon leaving The tent flap slapped shut with a wet flop After the priest left Yamun sat brooding staring into his glass The wind whistled around through the small gaps in the smoke hole Drips fell in the corners where the rainwater had soaked through the seams of the tent After the nightguard had laced up the flap of the tent Yamun spoke What do you think Me Great Lord the guard asked in surprise What do you think of the Khazari priest Yamun said pointing to the door Its not for me to say Great Lord the guard deferred Im asking so it is Come closer and tell me Intimidated by the khahan the man hesitantly came forward Noble khahan I apologize for speaking so boldly but I speak because you have ordered it The foreigner is disrespectful Oh Yamun commented as he began tugging at his other boot The guard became more confident He argues and does not heed your word He is only a foreigner yet he dares challenge you And what should I do Yamun asked jerking on the stubborn shoe He should be flogged If a man in my tumen spoke as he did our commander would have him beaten Your commander is a fool Yamun observed adding a loud grunt as the boot came off with a thick pop The guard looked up his eyes wide with astonishment Yamun continued What if everyone obeyed me and never questioned my word Where would I get my wise advisors Theyd be no better than a worn boot The khahan held up his own mudcaked boot and then tossed it aside Humbled the guard nodded automatically Why do you think the truthful man has one foot in the stirrup Truth is not always what people want to hear Learn and someday I will make you a commander Yamun finished suppressing a yawn He struggled to his feet and began unfastening the toggles of his robes Now Im tired and will sleep alone tonight See that my guards are in order and send someone to the womens tent Tell the ladies they wont be needed You will sleep at my doorstep By your word it shall be done said the guard touching his head to the floor acknowledging the duty the khahan had given him He ran to the doorway and loosened the laces enough to bark out his orders Before the guard finished the khahan had struggled out of his clothes and collapsed exhausted onto the hard wooden bed set up behind his throne Chanar It was late the next morning when an escort of blackrobed dayguards arrived for Koja to lead him to the royal compound Reluctantly the priest gathered his writing materials together Today he was not eager to enter Yamuns presence not after what had happened last night Although the wild night out in the storm was clear in his mind except for the moments where he had succumbed to blind panic Koja still had no understanding of what had happened That along with the idea of becoming the khahans biographer frightened him Taking the horse waiting for him the priest set out One man rode alongside him holding the reins of his horse Ever since Kojas accident the guards had taken the utmost precautions with his mount None of them wanted the foreigners horse to go galloping off again The rain from the night before had altered the dry steppe The snow cover had melted to patches and pools of slushy mud Grasses and flowers filled with bright vibrant green had sprung up where none had been before The ground around the Great Yurt was checked with swatches of fresh green and barren areas of churned mud Small blackheaded birds hopped around the edges of these mires poking at the standing water with their beaks Children charged at them scaring them off and then splashed merrily through the muck The legs and the hems of their robes were caked in mud Passing through the entrance to the khahans compound the guards dismounted and led their horses up the slope As they marched to the royal yurt Koja looked out across the the horse pens trying to decide which corral had been the scene of last nights terrifying visitation There was nothing to distinguish one from another so he couldnt be sure which of them was the one Captain Koja called out as he hurried to ride alongside the officer in charge did anything unusual happen last night Slowing his pace the officer turned to look at Koja Unusual Teylas sent a storm Yes but more than that Did the nightguards report anything strange The captain looked at him suspiciously his eyes narrowed Strange I did not hear of anything strange I heard rumors some horses had escaped A man who listens to his neighbors seldom hears the truth The captain once again picked up his pace making it clear he would answer no more questions As he neared the top of the hill Koja saw that the court was to be held outside today The area was already prepared Felt rugs in bright red and black patterns were laid out over the sodden ground layered thickly to keep the topmost ones dry A small stool for the khahan sat near the doorway to his yurt Behind the seat towered the khahans horsetail standard a sign that he was present in his compound On the left was the khahans golden bow case as well as a quiver filled with bluefeathered arrows On the right side of the standard was a saddle of polished red leather A white trim of sheepskin decorated the saddles edges and its silver fittings gleamed brilliantly in the sun A tray with cups a kettle and a pitcher sat beside Yamuns throne And let his horses graze in our pasture boomed the khahan from nearby He was walking up the hill along another trail evidently returning from some business He was still dressed in the thick layers of the his sleeping robes and his hair was loose undone Koja could see the tips of his toes under the long hems unshod and covered in cold mud With Yamun walked an old stoopbacked khan who was absentmindedly nodding as the khahan gave his orders The ancient man was a short thin fellow with patchy spots of hair and a perpetual stoop Koja recognized the man as Goyuk Khan one of Yamuns trusted advisors Behind those two followed an entourage of guards and attendants There were several unsmiling dayguards in heavy black kalats hands always at the hilts of their swords Yamuns quiverbearers his personal servants carried his morning clothes and a silverhiked sword in a bejeweled scabbard At the end of the group came one servant carrying a hooded falcon the khahans prized hunting bird out for its exercise All told Koja counted at least thirty people Yamun acted as if they were not there Koja had been told the khahan had two thousand quiverbearers in his service and another four thousand dayguards No one had ever estimated the number of nightguards the finest of the bodyguard because the khahan had decreed anyone that curious would be beheaded Koja had no doubt the khahan would carry out the sentence too Yamun casually tracked mud across the carpets and took his seat on the throne Goyuk bowed and took his leave to carry out the khahans orders Koja stood waiting to be recognized his shoes slowly filling up with cold mud Bring my bird Yamun ordered As a falconer walked forward another quiverbearer ran up with Yamuns hawking gauntlet and a small dish of raw meat Yamun pulled on the thick glove adorned with mottled red leather cut from the belly of a giant fire lizard one of the strange creatures that roamed the steppe The servant stood by with the meat ready Yamun held out his arm and coaxed the falcon onto his hand Even hooded the bird spread its wings and tried to fly away The khahan held the bird by its jesses and gripped the leash in his teeth He whispered soft words through clamped jaws as he took off the birds hood The falcon blinked and flapped again trying to get away Yamun held out a strip of raw meat The falcon snapped at the morsel tossing its head back to get the piece down When the bird settled down Yamun spit out the leash Welcome to my tent Koja of the Khazari Sit and enjoy the flesh of my lambs the milk of my horses the khahan called out giving the traditional greeting that preceded each days audience I thank you Illustrious Emperor of the Tuigan for your generosity Koja responded with a slight bow Like the invitation his answer was repeated every day a part of the ancient ritual that ruled the lives of the Tuigan Well then come and sit Quicklytheres a lot to do today I want to go hunting later Yamun said dispensing with etiquette Yes Great Lord Koja said as he hurried to his seat You will come too You will hunt with me Yamun handed the fierce bird to the falconer and dismissed the servant with a wave But first you must be my scribe for a little bit morejust for today Koja nodded and took his seat laying out his papers brushes inking stones and pressed cakes of powdered inkboth red and black A servant set out a small dish of water for mixing the powder Yamun waved his hand to his waiting attendants Ill dress now he commanded The quiverbearers ran forward unfurling a long strip of white cloth Four of them took positions in a square around the khahan their eyes turned holding the fabric up to form a screen Other servants set piles of clothes inside the screen then backed away Bring my women to dress me After a short delay two young girls came from the direction of the womens tents Koja guessed they were little more than eighteen years old They were Shou in appearance with glossy black hair pale skin and narrow eyes The girls hurried forward in quick mincing steps the way court ladies were trained to do Each wore a tight silk dress and the towering headdress of an unmarried woman Combs carved from the bones of exotic monsters held their hair in place Giggling shyly when they saw there was an audience the two girls stepped inside the screen and set to work These are the princesses Water Flower and Spring Peony Yamun boasted over the screen Gifts from the Shou emperor He sends me more than wine These two are princesses of the royal blood and he has given them to me Has he done this for your prince Yamun wriggled as the girls pulled his outer robes off Koja didnt answer trying to discreetly keep his eyes lowered He looked up briefly The khahans bare shoulders were covered with long narrow scars Dressing is not all they are good at Yamun broadly leered But then you would not know that Is it true you priests never touch women Koja flushed at the question Purity of mind and body is the path by which we seek Furo he said defensively So then women are impure Yamun asked an incredulous tone creeping into his voice Koja could hear more giggling behind the screen Passions cloud the mind and corrupt the spirit We live to control our passions and purify our minds so we can achieve perfection in thought and deed Unconsciously Koja settled into the crosslegged pose assumed by the priests of his temple when at their lessons Hah And what does that get you in the world Yamun held up his arms as the princesses undid his trousers Only one with a pure spirit can enter into the presence of the Enlightened One So if you avoid women you might just might get a chance to see your god Yamun had ducked from sight behind the screen Something like that yes There was a lot more to the philosophy of the Red Mountain Temple but Koja wasnt about to go into it now Preparing for his work Koja mixed his inks What does your Enlightened One do Does he reward you and strike down your enemies with lightning Yamuns voice was muffled as fresh clothes were pulled over his head The Enlightened One fills us with perfect understanding and harmony With that we do not have enemies Phah What if I were your enemy Would your perfect understanding protect you Yamun stepped out dressed in long loose robes of red and yellow silk embroidered with leaping tigers The quiverbearers and the women gathered up the dirty clothes and carried them away I have faith in Furo and the Enlightened One I have faith in my bow and my sword Yamun pronounced as he strapped on his sword They are the power Teylas gave them to me and he can strike down his enemies from the sky Teylas is a god you can use Koja was astonished by this last statement Gods are not used Teylas would take back the power if I did not use it so he is a god to be used Yamun snapped with a slight sneer Dressed and accoutered Yamun sat in his chair ready to hear the mornings business Dont you fear offending Teylas Koja asked as he wetted the writing brush Why Well Koja offered hesitantly rubbing at the back of his neck others might call your words presumptuous You might be wrong in interpreting Teylass will Others have not been given the power by Teylas That is why I sit in judgment of the khans and we have kept them waiting long enough he announced pointing to the quiverbearer coming up the hill It is time for business Yes Great Lord Koja said setting out a clean sheet of paper Enough Great Lord Today I permit you to call me khahan with no other titles Yamun looked to the quiverbearer as the man reached the courtyard Who waits the khahan asked pointing to the gate at the bottom of the hill The servant knelt bowing his head Glorious khahan the khans of the Jeun and Bahkshir bring petition that you hear their cases and one of Chanar Ong Khos men has come saying his master has returned The general awaits your pleasure to make his report Tell Chanar to come Yamun said irritated He should have presented himself when he arrived Jeun Khan and Bahkshir Khan will wait until this afternoon Koja sat up straighter and smoothed out his orange robe Khahan he asked hesitantly uncertain of the liberties of his new status as historian just where has General Chanar been Eh You dont know No Great Lord Khahan Yamun corrected No Khahan Koja said biting his lip over the fumble I only heard that he was gone sent away Good You werent meant to know I what You were not meant to know where he went Yamun said slowly and clearly Again you thought I was simple Koja of the Khazari in my empire you learn what I want you to learn and nothing else Learn that he stated with finality A servant in a white kalat stepped up to the edge of the carpets and knelt down pressing his head into the mats Speak Yamun ordered reluctantly recognizing the man The honorable second empress Mother Bayalun expresses relief that the khahan of all the Tuigan is once again unharmed by Teylass wrath She gives the greetings of a mother unto her stepson of a wife unto her husband the servant announced Yamun scowled Take my greetings to my stepmother and my wife Mother Bayalun at my pleasure The man stayed in his place head to the carpets The second empress wishes the indulgence of her husband and wonders if she might attend on the khahan his morning Mother Bayalun knows she is always welcome Go back and tell her she can attend if she wants Yamun lazily answered He waved to dismiss the man I thought you did not care for the second empress Koja commented as the whitegarbed man hurried out of sight I dont scribe I married her because tribal tradition demanded it Yamun explained Then why do you let her attend Yamun stretched his arms forward working the kinks out of his shoulders Why not She would learn what happens anyway If I send her away she becomes suspicious and makes trouble Here I can see what shes doing I pick my battles better than that Koja nodded I see Good Now Yamun said turning to Koja prepare yourself General Chanar and his aides are coming and you will have to take down all that is said Now you will learn where General Chanar has been Koja looked toward the gate of the stockade easily spotting the stiffbacked form of the general mounted on his horse Unlike all others who passed through the gate Chanar refused to dismount remaining in his saddle as his stocky white mare pranced up the hill Behind him trailed three aides on foot their horses at the gate As he rode forward Chanar kicked and whipped at his pony getting it to rear and prance The beast was already spirited but the general was determined to get it to perform more to make his entrance all the more exciting The aides following him kept a good distance back lest his horse lash out at them At last Chanar reached the top of the hill With a final spur he reared his horse back bringing its hooves down just short of the carpeting A quiverbearer ran forward and took the animals reins holding the horse while Chanar dismounted Swinging one leg over the horses neck the general easily slid from the saddle and landed on his feet in the mud with a loud plop Greetings to my khahan Chanar said loudly He looked to all those around him Though I was far when my khan called quickly did I come he said quoting an old poem Many are my enemies but like rotten trees they fall countered the khahan quoting from the same poem Greetings to my brother Chanar Yamun continued May the Sky God always make your horses fat and your lambs many A quiverbearer scooped a ladleful of kumiss He handed it to the khahan Yamun took a drink from the ladle The yellowwhite liquid clung to his mustache The ladle next passed to Chanar who noisily gulped a large swallow and handed it back The servant walked back to Yamun but the khahan waved him to Koja Today he also drinks from my cup Chanar looked in surprise from Yamun to Koja as the servant passed the ladle over He opened his mouth to say something then closed it just as quickly Steeling his stomach Koja took the ladle with both hands and gulped a swallow of the bitter drink Suppressing a gag he gave the silver ladle back to the servant The khahan turned to the east and poured a little kumiss on the carpet Then he turned to the south and the west doing the same at each spot Only the north an evil direction was avoided Meanwhile the servant took the horsetail banner from its stand and lowered it in front of Yamun Teylas lead us on the hunt Teylas lead us in battle Teylas make our wives fertile Yamun chanted in a toneless voice as he sprinkled the last of the kumiss over the banner The servants took the cup and banner and set them back in their places Yamun the formalities over sat back on his throne Sit Chanar and report the khahan said casually Slowly and with noticeable reluctance Chanar sat beside Koja eyeing the priest venomously Just as the general was about to speak a procession arrived from Bayaluns tent The second empress led the small group of only a few servants Stepping onto the carpets she bowed to the khahan I thank my husband for permitting me to attend Her silverbrown hair shone richly in the morning sun Yamun nodded respectfully to his stepmother Your wisdom is always welcome to us Mother Bayalun quickly took a seat opposite the men Now make your report General Chanar bade Yamun Chanar took in his breath slowly composing his thoughts After a slight pause he began Following your orders I went first to Tomkes ordu He camped all winter on Yellow Grass Steppe but with the spring now his pastures are almost gone Hes not to move until I tell him Yamun interrupted addressing his comment to Koja The priest dutifully noted it down writing with quick strokes As I said Chanar continued the grass there is almost gone He hopes to move east toward the TsuTsu people but he waits for your orders How are his men Tomke let many of them go home during the winter to reduce his grazing He has three tumen leftSartaks Nogais and Kadansin addition to his own Koja counted them off on his fingers They are not full His wizards count perhaps thirty minghans Minghan Koja softly interrupted What is this Please excuse me but I need to know for the letters Chanar answered him contemptuously A minghan is one hundred arban An arban is ten men Ah Koja said working out the figures on a small abacus Tomke has thirty thousand men Yamun scowled Hes let too many men go Order him to call them back immediately Koja quickly wrote the command on a fresh sheet of paper and handed it to a waiting quiverbearer The man presented the paper on a tray along with a stone coated with red ink The khahan took his seal a small silver block with a top in the shape of a bird from under his shirt The underside was carved in the contorted Tuigan script Yamun dipped the seal into the ink and pressed it on the sheet The sealbearer backed away blowing the ink dry as he went Continue ordered the khahan He has not sent many scouts Chanar noted The TsuTsu seem peaceful He thinks they will come over to us without fighting The lands behind him to the west have been conquered He has recruited some soldiers from them but they are poor warriors He says they are too weak to rebel and I agree with him They are dogs Dogs bite observed Yamun What do you say historian Koja was startled by the question too surprised to be diplomatic If they have been treated well they will not rebel But if Tomke has ruled them harshly they will fight more fiercely than ever before My own people the Khazari have fought so in ancient times against wicked emperors of Shou Lung So the Khazari are not just mice commented Chanar with a faint sneer Koja colored at the slight and bristled to make a reply Enough Yamun firmly interrupted Good advice Chanar how was my son treating them I didnt ask Chanar replied sullenly He shot an evil glare at Koja Someone should find out Send Hulagu Khan Draw up the orders to see that its done Koja nodded and made a brief note Was there anything else at Tomkes camp Yamun asked returning to Chanar Hes met with the chief of the ogres from the northern mountains They want to fight alongside us He wants to know if he should send the chief to your ordu What are they like Yamun tugged at his mustache considering the offer Theyre strong Their chief stands twice the height of a man and likes to fight I say we use them What do you know of ogres historian Yamun asked curious to see if the priest had any insight on these beasts Koja thought back to the scrolls in his temple that showed ogres as hideous bluefaced monsters locked in combat with Furo They are treacherous and violent beasts I would not trust them Hmmm Yamun sat wrapping the long end of his mustache around his finger considering the choices The Tuigan do not fight alongside beasts Tell Tomke to have nothing more to do with them Koja scribbled out the order and passed it along to the sealbearer Unless youve got more to say about Tomke tell me how Jads camp was Yamun commanded after hed struck his seal on the last order Jad sets his camp at Orkhon Oasis five hundred miles southeast of Tomke His pasture and water are good and he has held his men in hand Koja suddenly paid more careful attention He didnt know where the Orkhon Oasis was but southeast was the direction of Khazari How many Yamun queried Five tumenHamabek Jochi Enough I do not need their names What does he have to report Yamun scratched at his brow Chanar paused to pick at his teeth and spit into the mud at the edge of the carpet His scouts said they traveled south into the mountains The peaks were so high that snow never melted from the tops There they found a mountain that breathed fire and spit stones at them There was a race of little bearded men there who lived underground and prayed to the mountain These little men were wonderful craftsmen of iron The scouts claimed when they tried to cross it the mountain killed many of them with magical burning stones I think they lied and they were afraid to go on Mother Bayalun have your wizards ever told you of a mountain like this Yamun queried The second empress looked as if she were asleep At Yamuns words she slowly raised her head They have never spoken of such a place my husband Koja didnt remember any firebreathing mountains to the southeast but Khazari was on the edge of a great range of peaks Such a strange thing was certainly possible You should send a truthseeker to question the scouts Chanar continued Jad is too lenient with them How many scouts went out and how many came back Yamun took off his cap and set it on the ground I did not ask Chanar replied as if it was beneath him Then how do you know they lied countered Yamun Chanar sat silent brooding over the khahans rebuke Is Jad ready to march Yamun finally asked His men are in hand as I have said Chanar responded He looked down shielding the anger in his eyes from the khahan Koja made notes both for the khahan and himself He needed to find out more about JadsPrince Jadaransarmy where it was and what Yamun intended to do with it And what of my youngest son Hubadai Has he heard from the caliph of Semphar No Yamun Chanar said using the khahans familiar name The caliph apparently didnt believe the demands I delivered at the council Scribe were my demands unclear Both Yamun and Chanar turned their attention to Koja Koja cleared his throat and took the time to answer carefully Khahan he said watching Chanar out of the corner of his eye General Chanar presented your demands quite clearly What exactly did Chanar Ong Kho demand Bayalun asked suddenly Kojas mouth went dry as he wondered just why Bayalun was asking I apologize to General Chanar he began if my words do not do him justice It has been some time since I heard him speak He said that all caravans crossing the great steppe would pay taxes to the khahan of the Tuigan Koja paused rubbing the stubble on his head nervously Is that all Yamun queried Chanar sat up straight ready to protest Oh no Koja said hurriedly He also said that all kingdoms must offer you tribute or submit themselves to your rule It seemed quite clear to me Great Lord Chanar offered Yamun nodded in agreement So the caliph has not responded No Yamun Chanar noted No word has come from Semphar Perhaps the caliph does not believe you have the power Khahan suggested Koja After all Semphar has a large army and many cities Indeed the caliph is called the Chosen Prince of Denier and the Great Conqueror The Great Conqueror will learn Yamun said grimly How many men does Hubadai have at present He has kept all his tumen five of them ready I myself advised him to await your orders Chanar boasted Did you Yamun commented He smiled faintly though any warmth in his expression was twisted by the scar across his lip The lama could not decide if Yamun was being sarcastic or not If he was Chanar apparently did not notice Yes Yamun Chanar said proudly The general sat up straighter and puffed his chest out Scribe send this to Hubadai Yamun ordered settling back on his stool Hes to divide his command into three parts He will lead one and Ill send commanders to lead the others No man of his army will go hunting except for food to save the horses If a man breaks this law the first time he will get three strokes of the rod The second time he will have three times three The third time he will get three times times three times three His men are to have two weeks of food ready at all times The horses must have sufficient fodder on hand He must be ready to go to war on the day he is ordered Koja wrote furiously trying to keep up with the rapidfire pace of Yamuns order His men must have their weapons ready the khahan continued He signaled a servant to bring him a drink Each man must have two lances two bows and four hundred arrows Any man who doesnt will be beatenfive lashes of the rod Any man whose horse is not ready will be beaten for the same Any man who goes home to his family will be captured and given to his khan for punishment Koja finished writing with a flourish He held his brush poised ready to resume writing The morning audience is over Yamun abruptly announced Tonight there will be a feast to honor the safe return of Chanar Ong Kho Let all who welcome his return attend Chanar was stunned Although pleased about the feast he expected a longer meeting with the khahan Always in the past he had enjoyed Yamuns favor Now it seemed things had changed Reluctantly he stood to go bowing to the khahan as he started to leave Koja also got to his feet wincing as his legs refused to unbend Koja Yamun suddenly said using the priests personal name for the first time I want you to stay Im curious about your prince The priest waited as the khahan ordered obedient if baffled He also sensed Chanars dark looks behind him The general stalked away keeping his counsel to himself I will go now too my husband Mother Bayalun pronounced Yamun didnt answer After Bayalun and Chanar had departed the khahan ordered the servants to bring drinks black kumiss for himself and hot wine for Koja He once again lounged back on his stool Now Koja of the Khazari Ive let you learn something of our plans Perhaps now you can tell me what sort of man your Prince Ogandi is Yamun yawned Koja paused uncertain of what to say How much could he reveal without betraying his lord How much did he owe to the khahan Down the slope Mother Bayalun caught up with Chanar as he was walking toward his white mare She hobbled alongside him prodding the ground with the tip of her staff Greetings to our brave general she hailed Will you take a little time to visit with an old woman Chanar looked at her carefully The sunlight gave her face a warm glow It was a mature beauty livened with selfconfidence and will Bayalun gave Chanar a smile knowing and tempting Old woman was hardly the way Chanar would describe her Greetings returned Mother Bayalun Chanar replied A part of him was intrigued It was not like Bayalun to be so forward I couldnt help but see you are alone today instead of with your anda Yamun Chanar slowed his pace to match hers You are very observant His voice went cold He glanced back to the khahans yurt Yamun and the foreign priest were sitting in close conversation I have just come to apologize and say that I do not think it is proper Her tone was soothing to his injured pride You have been traveling much of late General Chanar Chanar turned in surprise at her concern I have been doing Yamuns wishes The khahan has messengers to carry out duties such as these Bayalun said as she steadied herself on the staff He sent you to Semphar It was an honor Chanar insisted Naturally though hardly taxing on your abilities she answered unperturbed by his outburst The priest you brought back is quite a prize of war Chanar glared at her needled by her barb Of course it was an honor to go to Tomkes ordu too Bayalun added as she stopped walking They were near her tent The second empress turned and looked back toward the khahan Since you have been gone Yamun has spent much time with the foreigner He has named the priest his grand historian I know Chanar muttered sullenly He followed the empresss gaze to where the two men sat Other things have happened while you carried messages Bayalun noted ominously Yamun consults the priest for advice listens to his word It could be the priest has enchanted Yamun Bayalun you know no spells can work here He Chanar tipped his head toward Yamuns tent chose this place with you in mind There are ways other than spells to enchant General Bayalun reminded Chanar as she turned to enter her yurt The priest is dangerousto both of us Not to me I am Yamuns anda Chanar corrected He didnt look Bayalun in the eyes Chanar things have changed More things could change Look up there That should be you talking to Yamun not the Khazari Bayalun pulled aside the tent flap The khahan forgets you forgets all the things you have done forgets you for a lama She paused again for effect Chanar let his head sink so that his chin almost rested on his chest He watched the second empress from the corner of his halfclosed eyes The light of the morning sun highlighted her figure the slimness showing even through the heavy clothes she wore Youre right Chanar conceded Yamun should listen to his khans his andanot strangers Of course Mother Bayalun agreed in a magnanimous tone The khahan needs good advisors not bad ones If he is not careful Yamun may forget the Tuigan way Then General Chanar what will happen to us Come into my tent Bayalun cooed as she stepped through the doorway I think we should talk more With a cold friendless smile Chanar stooped and stepped inside The tent flap silently fell back into place The Valiant Men Come Koja Yamun bellowed sit here beside me Under the night sky Yamun sat in halfdarkness illuminated by the flickering flames of a large foulsmelling fire Thick smoke from the burning dung drifted lazily into the chill starstudded sky Koja wrapped the sheepskin coat around himself and walked into the ring of light that marked Yamuns campfire The feast celebrating Chanars return had already begun by the time Koja arrived It was now late in the evening The sky was black and the moon was threequarters full Tonight it shone with a reddish hue dimly illuminating the landscape casting thick sepia shadows over everything Behind the moon trailed the string of sparkling lights Tuigan tales said these were the nine old suitors scorned by Becal the moon According to the story she in turn pursued Tengris the sun The celebration was no small affair In the walk to the top of the hill where Yamuns yurt stood Koja passed a dozen or more fires Around each was a circle of men eating and drinking At several fires the soldiers sang wailing obscene songs At one two squat burly men were stripped to the waist arms locked around each other as they wrestled in the dirt Their companions roared and shouted out bets More than a few troopers had already drunk themselves into a stupor and now lay around the fires snoring in sotted bursts Koja hurried past these fires During his hike Koja noticed a change in the quality of the men Near the base of the hill were men who carried iron paitzas the lowest pass issued by the khahan Koja knew because he recognized a few of the men as commanders of a jagun of one hundred soldiers Serving as the khahans scribe the Khazari had seen these men in audiences before Yamun Also around these fires were common dayguards now off duty The dayguard troopers were the least important of Yamuns elite bodyguard but they still had greater status than the rest of Yamuns army At the next ring were lesser noyans commanders of minghans of one thousand soldiers Koja did not recognize most of these men but guessed their rank by their talk The priest acknowledged the greetings of the few he had met At the innermost circle clustered around Yamuns fire were the greater noyans the commanders of the tumens of ten thousand men All of these men were khans of the various tribes important in their own right Occasionally one would leave his fire and slowly approach the center where the khahan sat However even the khans took care not to alarm the nightguards who stood around Yamuns camp Come and sit Koja Yamun repeated to the priest who still stood at the edge of the firelight Youll be my guest He waved to an empty space on his left A quiverbearer quickly rolled out a rug and set up a stool for Koja The priest glanced about furtively looking for Chanar This feast was in the generals honor and Koja didnt want to accidentally insult the man Chanar was already irritated enough as it was Koja couldnt spot the general among the faces around the fire Several of Yamuns wives old Goyuk and another khan Koja couldnt identify sat close to the khahan An iron pot hung from a tripod over the fire simmering with the rich smell of cooking meat Several leather bags undoubtedly kumiss and wine sat on the ground next to the revelers Sit insisted Yamun his speech slightly slurred Wine Bring the historian wine The khahan tore at a clublike shank of boiled meat Where is General Chanar Koja asked pulling his shearling coat out of the way as he sat down He had traded a nightguard an ivoryhilted dagger for the coat and then spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning the lice and vermin out of it Now it was tolerably clean and kept him quite warm Yamun didnt answer Kojas question choosing instead to talk to one of his pretty wives General Chanar where is he Koja asked again Yamun looked up from his dalliance Out he answered waving a hand toward the fires Out to see his men He has left the feast the priest asked confused No no He went to the other fires to see his commanders Hell be back Yamun swallowed down another ladle of kumiss Historian he said sternly turning away from his wife you werent here when the feasting began Where were you I had many things to do Khahan As historian I must take time to write I am sorry I am late Koja lied In truth he had spent the time praying to Furo for guidance and power hoping to find a way to send his letters to Prince Ogandi Then you have not eaten Bring him a bowl the khahan commanded to a waiting quiverbearer A servant appeared with a wine goblet and a silver bowl for Koja filling the latter from the steaming kettle over the fire The pot held chunks of boiled meat rich with the smell of game swimming in a greasy broth A second servant offered a platter covered with thick slabs of a sliced sausage Koja sniffed at it suspiciously Aware that Yamun was watching him he chose one of the smallest slices At least Furo was not particular about what his priests ate Koja thought Closing his eyes the priest took a bite of the sausage He had no idea what the meat was but it tasted good Fishing into his coat he pulled out an ivoryhandled knife mate to the one that bought him the coat and poked the meat around in the bowl stabbing out a large chunk of gristly flesh The meat was hot and burned his lip Koja took a quick swallow of wine to cool his mouth The food is good Koja complimented his host Yamun smiled Antelope Lord Yamun kill it on the hunt today one of the khans said from the other side of the fire It was Yamuns advisor Goyuk The old man smiled toothlessly his eyes nearly squeezed shut by wrinkles He only need one arrow Teylas make his aim good There was an impressed murmur from the others around the fire Goyuk Khan lost most his teeth at the battle of Big Hat Mountain fighting the Zamogedi Yamun explained The old man nodded and smiled a broad completely toothless smile That is true Goyuk confirmed beaming Toothlessness and strong drink gave his speech the chanting drone of a soothsayer or shaman What is the sausage made of Koja asked holding up a piece Horsemeat Yamun answered matteroffactly Koja looked at the piece of sausage he held with a whole new perspective My khahan I have returned a voice called out of the darkness Chanar still dressed in the clothes he wore that morning lurched into the camp He had a skin tucked under one arm dribbling kumiss across the ground He held a cup in the other As Chanar got close to the fire he stopped and stared at Yamun and Koja You are welcome at my fire Yamun said in greeting as he sipped on his own cup of kumiss Chanar stood where he was Where is my seat He has taken my seat The general pointed at Koja Sit Yamun ordered firmly and be quiet A servant unrolled a rug on the opposite side of the fire from the khahan and set out a stool Slowly without taking his eyes off Yamun Chanar slopped more kumiss from his skin He let the bag drop to the ground and slowly drained the cup Satisfied he stepped to the seat put out for him and sat down with a grunt He glowered at Yamun from across the fire Koja was uncertain if he should break the silence As he sat there he could feel the anger forming and solidifying between the two men The women disappeared slipping from their seats and fading into the night Khahan the priest finally said you made me your historian Kojas mouth went dry and his palms began to sweat How can I be your historian if I dont know your history For a moment Yamun didnt answer Then he spoke slowly Youre right historian He turned his gaze from Chanar Youve not been with me from the beginning So how can I write a proper history Koja pressed diverting Yamuns attention from the general The question seized hold of Yamuns mind and he mulled it over Koja quickly glanced at Chanar The man was still staring at Yamun Finally the honored generals eyes flicked toward Koja and then back to the khahan The priest could feel the tension begin to ebb as both mens thoughts were diverted What should you know Yamun wondered aloud His fingers began to toy with his mustache as he considered the question I do not know Yamun Perhaps how you became khahan Koja suggested That is no story Yamun declared I became khahan because my family is the Hoekun and we were strong Only the strong are chosen to be khahan One from your family has always been the khahan Koja asked Yes but Im the first khahan of the Tuigan in many generations For a long time the Tuigan werent a nation only many tribes who fought each other Then how did this come about Koja spread his hands to indicate the city of Quaraband I built this in the last yearafter the last of the tribes submitted to my will Yamun explained offhandedly But thats not my story The khahan paused and sucked at his teeth Finally Yamun began his tale When I was in my seventeenth summer my father the yekenoyan died Great pardons Yamun but I do not understand yekenoyan Koja interrupted It means great chieftain Yamun replied When a khan dies it is forbidden to use his name This is how we show respect to our ancestors Now Ill tell my story Koja remembered that Bayalun had no such fear for she had named Burekai freely The Khazari bit his lip to restrain his natural curiosity and just listen When I was younger my father the yekenoyan arranged a marriage for me continued Yamun Abatai khan of the Commani was anda to my father Abatai promised his daughter to be my wife when I came of age But when the yekenoyan died Abatai refused to honor the oath given to his anda Yamun stabbed out a large chunk of antelope and dropped it into his bowl Across the fire old Goyuk mumbled This Abatai was not good Yamun slid back from the fire and took up the tale again The daughter of Abatai was promised to me so I decided to take her I raised my ninetailed banner and called my seven valiant men to my side The khahan stopped to catch his breath We rode along the banks of the Rusj River and near Mount Bogdo we found the tents of the Commani That night a great storm came The Naican were afraid My seven valiant men were afraid The ground shook with Teylass voice and the Lord of the Sky spoke to me The khans at the fire glanced up at the night sky when Yamun mentioned the gods name as if expecting some kind of divine response The storm kept the Commani men in their tents and they did not find us hidden behind Mount Bogdo In the morning Toorl of the right wing attacked My seven valiant men attacked too We overturned the Commanis tents and carried off their women I claimed the daughter of Abatai and she became my first empress Yamun stabbed the meat in his bowl and took a bite Steam still rose from the boiled antelope Koja looked at the faces around the fire Chanar sat with his eyes closed The other two khans listened with rapt attention Even the boisterous singing that had started at one of the nearby feastfires didnt distract them Yamun himself was excited by his own telling his eyes aglow with the glories of olden days Now that I defeated the Commani people I scattered them among the Hoekun and the Naican the khahan added as a postscript between bites of antelope To Toorl of the Naican I gave five hundred to be slaves for him and his grandchildren To my seven valiant men I gave one hundred each to be slaves I also gave Toorl the Great Yurt and golden drinking cups of Abatai Thats how I first made the Hoekun strong and how I got my first empress Yamun said as he finished the story Chanar opened his eyes as the recitation ended The khans smiled in approval at the telling of the tale What happened to the first empress Koja asked She died bearing Hubadai many winters ago Koja wondered if there was a trace of sorrow in the words And what happened to Abatai khan of the Commani Koja asked to change the subject I killed him Yamun paused then called to a quiverbearer Bring Abatais cup he told the man The servant went to the royal yurt He came back carrying a package the size of a melon wrapped in red silk and handed it to Yamun The khahan unwrapped it There nestled in the cloth was a human skull The top had been sliced away and a silver cup was set in the recess This was Abatai Yamun said holding it out for Koja to see The hollow eyes of the skull stared at Koja Suddenly they flashed with a burning white light Koja jumped back in surprise almost toppling off his stool The bowl of meat and broth in his lap splashed to the ground The eyes they The eyes flashed again the light flickering and leaping Koja looked at the skull more closely and realized he was seeing the reflection off the silver bowl through the hollow eye sockets Whats wrong little priest did you read your future in the bones Chanar quipped from across the fire The old khan Goyuk guffawed at the joke Even Yamun found Kojas reaction amusing Hes dead and whats dead cant hurt us Yamun said with conviction He turned to Chanar Koja is filled with the might of his god but fears bones True warriors dont fear spirits Koja flushed with embarrassment at his own foolishness We must drink to the honor of the khahan Chanar announced hauling himself to his feet He stepped around the fire and stopped in front of Koja Uncorking his skin of kumiss he splashed the heady drink into the skull cup He took the skull from Yamun and handed it to Koja Unwillingly the priest took it in his hands Ai Chanar cried the signal to drink He tipped his head back and drank from the skin Ai echoed Yamun and the khans They raised their cups and took long swallows Koja looked at the skull cup in his hands The eyes were still staring at him and the brain recess was filled with a milky pool of kumiss He turned the cup so it wasnt facing him Drink little priest urged Chanar wiping his mustache on his sleeve or do you think the khahan has no honor Yamun looked at Koja noting that the lama had not joined in the toast His brow furrowed in vexation with his newly chosen historian You dont drink Koja took a great breath and hoisted the skull up to his lips He closed his eyes and gulped a draught of the wretched drink Quickly before they could urge him to take another swallow the priest held the skull out to Chanar Drink to the khahans might Koja gasped Ai called out the khans refilling their cups Chanar grinned at the look of distress that flickered over the priests face He took the offered cup and drained it in a single gulp Taking the skull with one hand he filled it again with kumiss and handed it back to Koja Drink to the khahans health he said with a wicked smile Koja choked Ai slurred out the khans The toasts were starting to take their toll Enough interrupted Yamun pushing the drinking skull away from Koja My health doesnt need toasting Ive told a story now its someone elses turn He looked pointedly at Koja Ive a story to tell Chanar snapped before Koja could speak up Its a good story and its all true He stepped back to give himself more space kicking up the ashes at the edge of the fire Yamun turned to Chanar Well what is it he asked barely keeping his irritation under control Great khahan the priest knows how you beat the Commani with the help of the Naican and your seven valiant men Now Ill tell of what happened to one of those seven valiant men Chanar dropped the skin of kumiss and stepped away from the fire Yes tell us urged the toothless Goyuk Khan Koja looked at Yamun before he voiced his own opinion The khahan was impassive Koja couldnt tell if he was displeased or bored so he kept his own mouth shut After the khanthe khahan began Chanar in a loud voice defeated the Commani he gave them to his companions like he told us He told his seven valiant men to gather the remaining men young and old of the Commani Measure all the men by the tongue of a cart and kill all those who cant walk under it the khahan ordered Measure all the men by a cart Koja asked meekly What does that mean Any male who cannot walk under the hitch of an oxcart is killed Only the little boys are spared Chanar answered curtly We killed all the men of the Commani like the khan ordered He wasnt the khahan yet you understand Chanar circled around the fire pacing as he spoke So we killed the men Then the khan gave out the women and children to us because he was pleased with his warriors He went to the seven valiant men and said You and I are brothers of the liver Weve been anda since we were young Continue to serve me faithfully and Ill give you great rewards He said this I heard it said Chanar kicked an ember at the edge of the fire back into the flames The valiant men were pleased by these words Chanar paused looking at Yamun Theres more to the story but perhaps the khahan doesnt want to hear it Tell your story insisted Yamun Chanar nodded to the khahan There isnt much more to tell Perhaps you know the tale One of the valiant men told the khan We are anda brothers of the liver I will stand at your side And I heard the khahan promise saying You are of my liver and will be my right hand forever When the khan went to war this valiant man was his right hand With his right hand the khan conquered the Quirish and gathered the scattered people of the Tuiganthe Basymats and the Jamaqua His right hand was strong Chanars story became more impassioned He stomped about the fire slapping his chest to emphasize his points I never failed or retreated I went with the khan against the Zamogedi when only nine returned I fought as his rear guard protecting him from the Zamogedi I took the khan to the ordu of my family and sheltered him I strengthened the khan when he returned to the Zamogedi to take his revenge Together we beat themkilling their men and enslaving their women and children All this because I was his anda When the Khassidi surrendered to me offering gifts of gold and silk werent those gifts sent to the khahan These things that are given are the khahans to give Isnt that the law Chanar faced the other khans at the fire directing his questions to them not Yamun or the priest Is true Great Prince mumbled Goyuk to Yamun his toothless speech made worse by drink He sent it all to you Satisfied with Goyuks answer the general turned to face the lama But now Chanar growled narrowing his eyes at Koja the valiant man no longer has gifts to send and another sits at his andas right hand And thats how the story ends The general turned from the priest stalked back to his stool and sprawled there satisfied that his point had been made With a sharp hiss Yamun stood and took a step toward Chanar who watched him like a cat The khahans fists were clenched tightly and his body swayed with tension This is no good Goyuk said softly laying his hand on Yamuns arm Chanar is your guest Yamun stopped listening to the truth in Goyuks words Koja quietly slid his stool away from the khahan fearful of what might happen next The singing from the other fires started up again Nightguards snarled Yamun Come with me Im going to visit the other fires With that he wheeled and strode off into the darkness The guards streamed past and the quiverbearers followed after carrying food and drink for the khahan no matter where he stopped Those around the fire watched the entourage wend down the hillside Koja sat quietly suddenly feeling himself among enemies This is a dangerous game you play Prince Chanar observed Goyuk leaning over to speak softly in Chanars ear He cant kill me Chanar confidently replied as he watched Yamun march down the hill The Khassidi and many others would go back to their ordus if he did Is true you are well loved but Yamun is the khahan the old man cautioned Chanar dismissed Goyuks comments with a gulp of kumiss As he drank down the cup he once again saw Koja on the other side of the fire Priest he hissed at the lama Yamun trusts you Well I am his anda You are a foreigner an outsider The general leaned forward until his face was almost in the flames And if you betray the Tuigan Ill have great fun hunting you down Do you know how a traitor is killed We crush the breath out of him under a plank piled with heavy stones Its a slow and painful death Koja paled Remember it and remember me Chanar warned With those words he threw the rest of the kumiss on the fire and stood I must go to my men he told Goyuk Khan ignoring Kojas presence The old khan nodded and Chanar walked off into the darkness The rest of the evening seemed to pass quickly and slowly all at once At first Koja was content to sit near the fire keeping away the increasing chill of the frosty night air The servants kept refilling his golden goblet having long since taken the skull away The old khan Goyuk seeing that the priest wasnt going anywhere began to talk incessantly Koja only understood about half of what the codger said but smiled and nodded politely nonetheless The khan talked about his ordu his horses the great battles he had fought in and how a horse had kicked out his teeth At least that is what Koja thought he was discussing As the night went on Goyuks speech became increasingly unintelligible Several times Koja tried to get up and leave Each effort brought a storm of protest from Goyuk This story is just getting good he would insist and then demand more wine for the priest Eventually Koja wasnt even sure his legs would work if he did manage to get away At last the kumiss and wine had their effect The old man nodded off in midsentence then snapped back awake and rambled on for a while longer Finally Goyuk bedded down moving the stool out of the way and wrapping the rug around himself Koja too tired to walk back to his yurt followed custom rolling the thick felt rug tightly around himself Within a few minutes he was sound asleep Down the slope a hooded servant slipped among the fires seeking out one man At each circle he stopped standing in the shadows staring at the faces Finally at one fire where the drinking was the most riotous the servant found the man whom he sought Moving through the darkness he sidled up closer to his goal The revelers were too involved with their drink to notice him Softly he leaned up and whispered in the ear of his man The khadun Lady Bayalun hears that you have been wronged this night he hissed Is Chanar to let himself be usurped by a stranger she asks Eh What do you say the drunken General Chanar blurted in surprise Shhh Quietly She fears you fall from Yamuns favor Chanar moved to speak but the messenger quickly pressed his hand on the generals shoulder This is not the place to talk The khadun opens her tent to you if you will come Hmm when Chanar asked trying to look at the man without turning his head Tonight while the eyes of others are occupied The messenger waited letting Chanar make his decision Tell her Ill come Chanar finally whispered Without another word the messenger faded back into the darkness The campfires had burned down to lifeless ashes and only thick plumes of smoke rose up into the blackness of night Koja found himself sitting up shivering in the cold rugs and robes fallen off his back It didnt strike him as odd that he could see the sleeping forms of men the empty yurts flapping in the breeze even in perfect darkness They were just grayer forms against the black plain There was a clink of rock against rock behind him and then a soft wet scrape of mud on stone Wheeling around he was confronted by a man in yellow and orange robes hunched over so his face could not be seen The mans hands were doing something something that matched the sounds of stone against stone Who Koja started to blurt out The man looked up and stopped Koja in midsentence It was his old master from the temple his bald head lined with age The master smiled and nodded to the priest and then went back to his work building a wall With a scrape the master dragged a trowel across the stones top spreading a thick layer of mortar Koja slowly turned around The men fires and yurts were gone A low wall encircled him trapping him beside the campfire Turning back Koja watched his master lift a square block and set it in place atop the fresh mortar Master what are you doing Koja could feel a growing panic inside himself All our lives we struggle to be free of walls intoned the master never once stopping his work All our lives we build stronger walls With a scrape and heavy thud another stone was set in place Know young student of the walls you buildand who they belong to Suddenly the wall was finished towering over Koja The master was gone Koja heaved to his feet and whirled about looking for his mentor There in front of him was a banner set in the ground From its top hung nine black horsetailsthe khahans banner He turned the other way There was another with nine white yak tailsthe khaduns banner Stumbling backward he tripped and fell against anothera golden disk hung with silken streamers of yellow and redPrince Ogandis banner Panicked Koja fell to the ground and closed his eyes A sound of heavy breathing and a blast of steam across Kojas face forced him to look again The banners were gone and the wall that circled him shivered and moved It became a great beast black and shimmering A pair of eyes inhuman and cold stared down at him Are you the khahan of the barbarians the beast boomed No answered Koja in a weak whisper The eyes blinked Ah Then you are with him it decided That is good Finally it is time The eyes glowed brighter Fearful Koja looked away from the baleful gleam There was a rushing of wind and then the shape was gone Looking up the priest saw his master again Be careful Koja of the walls you build the old lama called out The master faded growing dimmer to Kojas sight until there was nothing but the dull gray horizon Then there was nothing at all The priest woke slowly dimly remembering the voices from his sleep A sharp tang welled up at the base of his skull tingling the stubble of his neck hair Involuntarily the thin priest inhaled deeply Suddenly he was wide awake sneezing and gagging his nostrils filled with the smoke of burning manure He flailed about then opened his eyes Thick wads of stinging smoke assailed him Koja crawled out of his rug and into clear air It is a good day a wavering voice somewhere to Kojas left said Still blinking the priest looked toward the voice He could hardly see the speaker because the dawn sun blazed behind the mans shoulder Koja shielded his eyes from the orangered glow with one hand and rubbed away the last of his tears with the other Sitting next to the thickly smoking campfire was the ancient Goyuk Khan poking at the coals with a stick He looked back at Koja and smiled one of his broad toothless grins Koja weakly smiled back His head felt thick from drink and pained from his sudden awakening His mouth was gummy The years among the lamas had not prepared him for a night of feasting with the Tuigan Is time to eat Goyuk said He didnt look the least bit haggard from the celebration Poking the fire again Goyuk fished out an ashcovered lump bits of burning coals still clinging to it Picking it up carefully he brushed the embers away with his dirty fingers and held it out to Koja Koja looked at it dubiously knowing full well that he had to take it or offend the old khan It looked like a scrap of the horsemeat sausage roasted in the fire He gingerly took it juggling it between his hands to avoid burning his fingers Eat urged the khan is good Thank you said Koja with a forced smile He ate it down quickly doing his best not to taste the meat Breakfast finished Koja struggled to his feet to look for water The sun had barely risen over the horizon but already men were about The guards were changing the dayguards replacing the nightguards Quiverbearers and household slaves were going from yurt to yurt preparing for the morning Not everyone was awake however Koja weaved through the sleepers clustered around the feastfires Most of the revelers were still snoring blissfully unusual for the Tuigan camp which was normally bustling by this hour Some were wrapped in their blankets and rugs curled closely around small mounds of smoldering embers However more than a few were sprawled haphazardly over the ground their kalats pulled up tight around them Koja guessed many of them slept on the same spots where they had passed out the night before After much futile searching Koja finally collared a servant carrying a bucket of water Scooping it up with his hands he gulped down a mouthful Though cold enough to numb his fingers the priest splashed the water over his face and head vigorously rubbing his skin to clear his brain One of Yamuns quiverbearers presented himself to Koja The Illustrious Emperor of the Tuigan Yamun Khahan sends me to ask why his historian is not in attendance at the yurt of his lord The servant remained kneeling before the lama Koja looked at the man in surprise He hadnt expected the khahan to conduct business so early this morning Furthermore the priest didnt realize his presence would be needed so constantly Take me to his yurt he ordered Obediently the servant led Koja through the clutter around the feastfires Reaching the tent the man announced Kojas arrival The priest was quickly ushered inside This morning the yurt was arranged differently Yamuns throne was gone and the braziers had been moved to the sides of the tent The flap covering the smoke hole was opened wide as was the door allowing rays of sunlight to dazzle the normally gloomy interior In the center of the yurt in a shaft of sunlight sat a circle of men Yamun was bareheaded his conical hat set aside The light gleamed off his tonsure and brought out the red color of his hair He still wore the heavy sable coat he had worm the night before though now it was mudstained and smudged with soot The other men had likewise removed their hats making a ring of shining bald domes in the center of the yurt Koja was reminded of the masters of his temple although they didnt sport the long side braids favored by these warriors Historian youll sit here called out Yamun as the lama entered He slapped his hand on the rug just behind himself Koja walked around the circle and took his seat Chanar blearyeyed from the nights festivities sat on one side of Yamun Goyuk sat on the other There were three others wearing golden cloths and embroidered silks signs that they were powerful khans but Koja did not recognize them Their rich clothes were travelstained and rumpled At the farthest end of the circle sitting slightly away from the rest was a common trooper His clothes a simple blue kalat and brown trousers were filthy with mud and grime He stank powerfully Koja noticed as he walked by The khans glanced toward Koja as he sat Goyuk smiled another of his gaping smiles A look of displeasure sparked in Chanars eyes Yamun leaned forward drawing their attention to the sheet spread out in front of them It was a crude map something which surprised Koja He hadnt seen any maps since arriving and he had assumed the Tuigan had no knowledge of cartography Here was another surprise about his hosts The lama craned his neck trying to get a view of the sheet Semphar is here Yamun said continuing a conversation begun before the priest entered He thrust a stubby finger at one corner of the sheet Hubadai waits with his army at foot of Fergana Pass He traced his finger across the map to a point closer to the center Were here And where is Jad asked one of the khans Koja didnt know At the Orkhon Oasisthere Yamun pointed to the far side of the map The priest strained even harder to see where Yamun was indicating All he could make out was a blurry area of lines and scribbles And Tomke the same khan asked He was a wolffaced man with high sharp cheekbones a narrow nose and pointed chin His graying hair was well greased and bound in three braids one on each side of his head and a third at the back He stays in the north to gather his men Im going to hold him in reserve Yamun explained There was a grunt of general understanding from the men listening They studied the map for a few minutes learning the dispositions of the armies What will you do Goyuk finally asked his nose practically touching the map as he screwed up his eyes to see the lines Semphar Or Khazari At the mention of Khazari Koja scooted sideways a little trying to find a better angle to see the map By leaning to the left he could see it clearer Semphar must fall Theyve refused my demands Hubadai will march against them The khahan traced a line on the map Again there was a murmur of approval Chanar glanced at the wolffaced khan giving him the tiniest of nods Great Yamun the man said I must speak because it is my duty under heaven Your son Hubadai is a brave and valiant warrior but he is young and has not gone to war often The caliph of Semphar is a mighty ruler Our spies tell us he has many soldiers protected by great stone walls It would be wisdom to send a wise and experienced warrior to instruct and aid your son My son is my son He must fight Yamun snapped Of course Great Khan Chanar noted He must command Perhaps Chagadai does not mean you should send a new commander Send someone you can trust to advise Hubadai Make this advisor commander of the right wing Hubadai is young and his temper is quick pressed Chagadai the wolfish khan Send him someone to cool his rashness someone who knows the traps of war Send someone your son can learn from A wise man has a wise tutor Chanar offered They speak wisely Yamun wheezed out Goyuk The khahan looked at the khans around the circle pondering the advice Chagadais advice is good Yamun finally said But who should I send You Chagadai Great Lord my wisdom is the wisdom of the tent the khan demurred I do not have the cunning for war Send a warrior who has served you well I am too old said Goyuk before Yamun could even ask him Send a young man What about you Chanar Yamun asked I hoped to visit the yurts of my people the general began but by your word it shall be done Then it is done Yamun concluded I hoped you would ride by my side but you must serve my son now Hell listen to you You have my word Semphar will fall Chanar bowed smiling as he did so But what about Khazari inquired Goyuk pointing at the map Koja peering over their shoulders could see that Chagadai pointed to the same general area of the map as the Orkhon Oasis So Prince Jad was camped near Khazari he thought Before we talk we must hear the reports of the scouts Yamun said Come forward trooper The soldier at the back slid forward and prostrated himself This man led the scouts I sent to Khazari We will hear his report But first Yamun said turning to Koja behind him you must go Wait outside You will be called when you are needed Yes Khahan Koja said softly concealing his bitter disappointment Yamuns face was impassive unconcerned but Chanar looked at the priest with smug satisfaction As quickly as he could Koja hurried out of the yurt Outside the revelers were waking up Koja with nothing else to do sat down on his haunches beside the doorway He strained to hear anything of the conversation inside but the thick felt of the yurt swallowed up the words Koja sat there disconsolate watching hungover khans wander away from the scene of last nights feast The dayguards walked among the circles kicking awake their brothers who had passed out the night before A few halfhearted fights broke out more loud arguments than real brawls One did turn into a serious battle as two men wrestled across the ground Their fight quickly attracted others and soon there was a shouting crowd around the battlers Yamun and the khans came out of the yurt shortly after the fight started but no one seemed very interested in stopping the conflict Yamun and the others stood by as the two brawlers rolled around trying to get each other in a deadly hold Within minutes though one man screamed and the fight ended as quickly as it had started Ignoring Koja who sat expectantly by the door the khahan called down to the big wrestler You are a good fighter The man knelt where he was Teylas has given his strength to me he answered Yamun raised an eyebrow at the mans words Whats your ordu I am Sechen of the Naican the wrestler answered I have killed five men with my bare hands Khahan Behind him the dayguards dragged his dead opponent away Sechen youre proud and shameless I like you Yamun said impulsively From now on you will serve at my side Sechen fell into the dirt humbling himself before the khahan Inarticulate cries of thanks poured from the mans lips Koja looked in horror at the big wrestler The khahan had just honored an admitted killer praising the man for what he had done Astonished the priest looked at the emperor of the Tuigan The man showed no shame or conscience for what he had just done Koja had almost forgotten just what the Tuigan were For all their cunning craftsmanship and military skill the Tuigan were still uncivilized barbarians Koja wondered if they could ever be anything more Yamun finally finished speaking with the wrestler but the grateful man was still kneeling at his feet Looking at Koja standing beside him the khahan gave no notice of the priests horrified expression We have reached a decision lama Yamun said I have an answer for your prince What is the message I am to take to Prince Ogandi Koja finally hesitantly asked his voice trembling with rage and fear You dont The Tuigan ride to Khazari with their own answer No one speaks for us Yamun pronounced And your prince will hear from me very soon On The March Elsewhere in the royal compound another meeting was just beginning It was a furtive liaison in one of the yurts used as a storehouse The tents felt walls were black darkened by powdered charcoal The smoke hole was sealed shut and the door flap was tightly closed It was an isolated yurt seldom visited or disturbed Outside a few soldiers wearing the blue kalat of common troopers leaned on their lances Their eyes were far from idle though Under a guise of nonchalance the men constantly scanned the area ready to warn of any intruders Inside the black yurt was barely lit by one small lamp It burned fitfully the little circle of light it cast growing and shrinking with each flicker The dim glow revealed rolls of fabric sealed baskets rugs and stacks of metal pots Nestled in all this within the circle of light were General Chanar and Mother Bayalun She was dressed in a simple robe hardly fitting to her station Around her head she had wrapped several coils of a shawl until her face was hidden in shadows Her staff leaned against a bale beside her Did you do as I instructed she demanded leaning forward to look the general in the eye Everything answered Chanar with cocky selfassurance And Chagadai He played his part Chanar said with a smile What did you promise him More than nothing she answered avoiding his question What is the result He rides to the Sindhe River to meet with Jad Then they go to Khazari The general warmed his hands over the lamp Excellent Soon Chanar you will become the true khahan Mother Bayalun said coldly And where are you to be I am to ride to Fergana Pass to advise Hubadai Chanar heard something and stopped speaking He sat up straight looking about him to see the source of the noise The dark walls of the tent quivered in a faint breeze Relax my general Bayalun said soothingly We are alone My guards outside will make sure of that Now take this She handed him a small leather bag Mix it with some wine tonight then drink it It will make you sick but dont worry it wont kill you Yamun will see that you are too sick to travel Why do this he questioned eyeing the bag dubiously Bayalun grabbed his hand and stuffed the bag into his fingers Dont be a fool she said sharply We need each other alive And you need to be here in Quarabandnot with Hubadai When the khahan is dealt with you must be ready to move so that means you must stay here with me How are you going to do that Tell Yamun you dont feel like riding out today That its an unlucky day She gently squeezed his fingers Use the powder or he will become suspicious Oh Chanar said slowly coming to understand What if he orders a cart to take me to Hubadai He wont she contended The khaduns patience was starting to wear thin He has too much to do Tell him you will take care of your arrangements Hell believe you And then what Then you wait Things will work just as weve planned And then Bayalun reached out and laid her hand gently on his arm We will lead the Tuigan to their true glory Yes Chanar savored the thought When Im khahan Ill get rid of these foreigners Of course Mother Bayalun said stroking his arm That is the whole reason were doing this isnt it Chanar grinned wolfishly openly admiring the older woman She was not passive a mere ornament like Yamuns Shou princesses She was bold a woman for a true warrior But quickly she urged breaking the mood you must go before anyone becomes suspicious by your absence Leave now My men will make sure the way is clear She pressed on his arm sending him on his way Chanar moved to go with only a little reluctance Her words reminded him of the plans dangers Going to the door he peered out through a tiny gap After what seemed an interminable minute of watching he slipped out through the doorway There was a brief flash of sunlight and then the tent fell dark again Bayalun sat on the pile of rugs leaning on her staff her eyes closed as she thought Her plans were going well Nothing had gone wrong but that worried her She was certain that by now there would have been some mistake Perfect plans are made by fools or so went the old proverb Does he suspect said a soft yipping voice from the darkness Mother Bayalun looked up slowly not showing any surprise at the new speaker No but thats through no help from you Your clumsiness almost gave you away she snapped What are you doing here A large fox honey brown in color walked into the light Moving opposite Bayalun it settled back on its haunches With its front paws it produced a long pipe from the leather bag it carried slung around its neck I wish you people would move your tents It would make things a lot easier Id change out of this form but these damned magicdead lands prevent me Why are you here you insolent creature Bayalun demanded thumping the rolledup rug beside the foxthing My master sent me it explained as it stuffed tobacco into the pipe and tamped it down with a paw more human than foxlike Are we stuck with that dolt Who The buffoon who was just here the fox explained He dug into his bag and pulled out a smoldering ember casually holding the burning coal in his paws Stole it from a fire outside the fox offered before she could ask He set the coal to the pipe Dont light that in here Bayalun snapped The fox looked up at her in surprise The smoke will give us away To whom Your guards Theyre the only ones outside The fox drew a long puff on the pipe blowing out sweet smoke from the combination of tobacco and strange herbs This shape lets me get around easily but it is so tiring Especially when everyone wants to chase you It puffed on the pipe again watching Bayaluns increasing irritation with an unconcealed glee You take too many risks Someone saw you Bayalun asked with alarm Some saw a fox nothing more the creature replied confidently Carrying a bag I was careful Stop worrying like an old woman Ive done this all my life which is longer than yourseven if you are one of those halfspirit Maraloi The foxthing blew smoke up toward the ceiling Bayalun started at the mention of the Maraloi How did you know she demanded No one knows of that The emperor of Shou Lung knows Your father was one of the Maraloi spirits of the great northern wood Humans think the Maraloi dont exist You and I know better The fox tapped its pipe shaking out the excess ash But the man you were talking to Will present no problems Bayalun said a little subdued He thinks we only plan to get Yamun out of Quaraband so he can seize power He has no idea of my true intentions Our true intentions corrected the fox rubbing its back against a roughsided basket Ahh it sighed Our intentions Bayalun noted And just what does your master intend He is concerned He wants to be sure that everything is as he agreed The foxthing suddenly dropped its casual air Yamun Khahan continues to unite the tribes and his army grows larger Soon even the unbreachable Dragonwall will be threatened by his might There is a chance its magic may not be able to hold him back You assured my master that there would be peace between Shou Lung and the Tuigan There has been no change she answered defensively Once I have control I will see that the peace between the Tuigan and Shou Lung remains unbroken But your master has certain obligations to fulfill too Of course assured the fox between draws on its pipe Thats why he sent me What You needed an assassin an expert in disguise Am I not the fox said as it stood and took a little bow brilliant at disguise Not if thats the best you can do Bayalun shot back She was furious with the hu hsien this inhuman trickster of the spirit realm She was equally furious with the Shou mandarin who sent it The mighty of Shou Lung think they can toy with me she cursed silently but Ill show them just how dangerous that can be Go back to your master and tell him to send me a real assassin not a clowning animal The fox bit down hard on the stem of its pipe You will take whomever my master sends it snarled baring its fangs as its animal side boiled to the surface Now old woman Im tired of this Tell me what I am to do Bayalun relented There is a post you can fillassuming you can look humanamong the khahans dayguards Then you will be close to him You must take it and wait Bayalun twisted the staff between her hands as she explained things Thats all How will I know when to act the beast asked I will send you a message Bayalun answered How Thats all you need know she snapped frowning at the beasts curiosity Too much knowledge and you become a danger to everything Tomorrow present yourself to Dayir Bahadurin human form He commands a jagun of the dayguard and will see to your position Then wait for my word She narrowed her eyes waiting for any more questions None came Now you may leave The fox blew a puff of sweet smoke I havent finished my pipe it declared Leave now Bayalun hissed lest I complain to your master The fox pricked up its ears Careful or I will complain to your lord The hu hsien watched the empresss reaction I find you interesting halfMaraloi Your husband might be strong enough to seize the riches of Shou Lung but you want him dead Your ambitions are strange Yamun Khahan killed the yekenoyanmy husband his fatherso he could rule the Hoekun I will never forgive him for that Besides Bayalun thought with the khahan dead I will control the Tuigan Chanar will be khahan but I will have the power Now no more questions Very well I will take my leave the foxthing said pompously It closed the lid on the pipe and stuffed it back into the pouch Dropping to all fours it smiled a foxish smile at Bayalun and lightly leaped away into the darkness After the creature had left Bayalun waited patiently for some time She was in no hurry Haste ruined careful plans She had learned that from experience It was impossible to keep secret the fact that the khahan was on the move toward Khazari and by the afternoon the news had spread through all of Quaraband Yamuns women had emptied out the Great Yurt and had started to take it down Within an hour the yurt was stripped of its felt walls the frame standing like a skeleton atop the hill The dismantling of the royal yurt was a signal to the rest of the city Men rode from their tents extra horses in tow to assembly areas outside Quaraband Each arban of ten men gathered to form the jaguns of one hundred and in turn the minghans of one thousand For every unit there was a specific meeting place so that the men could be organized quickly Throughout the day yurts disappeared from the valley as preparations were made to move out Men loaded Yamuns throne onto the back of a huge cart which was roofed with a smaller version of the royal yurt The cart pulled by a team of eight oxen was Yamuns capital while on campaign During the work the khahan set up his headquarters in the sunshine He sat on his bed a small woodenframed thing with stubby legs Koja sat on a stool nearby along with several other scribes mostly Bayaluns wizards and holy men All of them furiously scribbled down orders rolling up the sheets as they were done and thrusting them into the hands of waiting messengers Koja had just finished writing out a sheet of orders meant for Hubadai at Fergana Pass It is to be there in no less than five days insisted Yamun as the priest handed the scroll to a rider By your word it shall be done the rider shouted sprinting to his horse before he had even finished speaking Koja leaned to the scribe next to him a young man with a thin black goatee and shaven head How can that be Koja asked pointing his writing brush at the departing rider How can he deliver a message so quickly Do they use magic The young priest shook his head barely looking up from his work He is an imperial messenger so he can use the posthouses He will ride all day changing horses at special stations Then another man will take the message at night The priest bent back to his work Yamun dictated orders for hours going into minute details for the impending march By his orders the army was divided into three wings with Yamun in command of the center Troops were assigned and tumens and minghans dispatched to the different wings Commanders received orders concerning the amount of food to carry the number and types of weapons they were to employ and how many horses each man was to have The khahan appointed yurtchis the armys purveyors to supervise the camps and find supplies as they marched Many of the orders concerned the condition of the horses setting penalties for galloping them unnecessarily or working them too hard Koja wrote until his fingers were numb The nightguard came to relieve the dayguard as the sun set Lamps were brought and the scribes continued to work by the dim glow Finally Koja walked back toward his tent the nightguards in his wake His legs moved mechanically as his mind slowly dozed off All he could think of was the pile of cushions that waited for him at the yurtsoft cushions and warm blankets that would cradle him while he slept When the priest got to his tent he stopped A barren circle of crushed grass filled the space where his yurt had stood In its place were two horses and a camel hobbled to keep them from wandering a small mound of sacks and baggage and the curledup shape of his servant sleeping on the ground Koja moaned It was to be another night sleeping under the stars Searching through the baggage he found a set of rugs Resigned to his situation Koja lay down using his leather bag for a pillow and pulled the rugs tight around him Within a few minutes lulled by the snoring of his servant the priest was sound asleep In the morning Koja awoke to find that Quaraband was gone All that remained was a field of wastefire scars muddy tracks and garbage A line of creaking carts drawn by lowing oxen lumbered across the green steppe carrying the households deeper into the trackless plain Many miles away in a more secluded spot the city would be rebuilt by the women and children There the families would wait until their men returned from war File after file of soldiers moved out leading their mounts across the river and away to the east The water normally clear was a turgid brown flow The banks had been turned into quagmires by the churning tread of man and horse There were shouted goodbyes to wives and children assuring them of their safe return Horses whinnied oxen lowed An arban of dayguards rode to Kojas camp Come with us grand historian The khahan commands you to ride with him Wait until I have eaten Koja requested refusing to be rushed No insisted the chief of the arban The khahan leaves now But my food Learn to eat in the saddle the experienced old campaigner said helpfully He signaled his men that it was time to go Back aching from a night on the ground Koja gingerly climbed into his horses saddle and rode to join the khahans train Behind him his servant led a small string of pack animals The journey quickly fell into a pattern that would become routine over the coming days The army moved at a brisk pace even the oxcarts moved faster than Koja expected For him the ride was painful and jolting The horsewarriors traveled for ten hours a day stopping only occasionally to let the horses graze and water themselves Fortunately the animals were tough wiry little mounts much different from the wellbred and magnificent steeds that Koja had seen in Khazari and Shou Lung Surely the priest thought these animals must draw some of their nourishment from the air With the exception of a small bag of millet at night the men made no effort to feed the horses letting them survive on the new shoots of grasses and tough scrub they found on the steppe By the time Yamun called for camp on the first day it was dusk A few yurts were standing here and there tents of the khans but the bulk of the army simply slept under the stars Each man laid out a small felt rug to use as a mat taking his saddle for a pillow The mares were milked and driven into clusters around a single tethered stallion where they stayed for the night grazing and sleeping Each arban camped as a group kindling a fire at their center The men worked together to prepare their evening meal As the red horizon of twilight gave way to darkness the glow of campfires covered the plain Koja ate at the camp of the khahan served by the quiverbearers Dinner was a simple stew of dried meat and milk curds bitter yet bland browngray in color Nonetheless Koja ate it with enthusiasm A meal any meal was welcome After dinner Yamun found Koja alone in the dark Priest he began without any preamble the khans are unhappy with you They think you will try to curse the army A few suggest I should get rid of you He said no more but gazed at Koja The priest swallowed suddenly feeling Yamuns stare Khahan as I have said my duty is to Prince Ogandi Still your intentions may not be hostile so I should not bring misfortune to you he said in a single breath not giving Yamun the chance to interrupt No wonder youre a diplomat Yamun said sorting out the answer Remember thisyou owe me your life You were dead and brought back at my command Betray me and Ill take it back Koja nodded That night the lama returned to his own campfire Hodj was already asleep The nightguards sat at a small fire a little way off from Kojas The lama dug into his bags finally pulling out the small packet of letters he had written He opened them and surveyed the sheets he had prepared for Prince Ogandi Each page was covered with fine brushstrokes column upon column of neatly arranged characters The sheets represented hours of work in his tent hours inking out pages of crabbed text They were supposed to have been the sum and goal of his existence at least while among the Tuigan The prince might find these useful he said to himself He looked over the yellow sheets of rice paper Or he may already know everything Ive written he countered In any case he will know the intentions of the khahan soon enough Koja stared at the pages Yamun had treated him well showing him kindnesses and trust far beyond what his position warranted If he sent the letters which might not even be useful he would betray that trust Koja sighed and paged through the letters again If he didnt send the letters would it matter to the prince anyway Yamun Khahan you are wrong Koja said clearly as if there was anyone to hear I am a very bad diplomat He touched a corner of the top sheet to the coals of the campfire in front of him The flame eagerly devoured the flimsy paper One by one he burned the sheets watching their ashes rise into the night sky In the morning the letters were only a few crumbled wisps of ash As Koja rolled awake Hodj stirred the last of the ashes into the fire Soon the servant poured out cups of tea one thick with milk and salt for himself and the other with butter and sugar for Koja Apart from the tea however this mornings breakfast was different Instead of boiling a porridge of millet and mares milk or reheating last nights dinner the servant spooned globs of a white paste into a leather bag He filled the sack with water and sealed it tightly then he hung one bag from the saddle of each horse Next he took several strips of dried meat and slid them between the saddle and the blanket Later we eat Hodj answered patting the saddle Dried meat and mares curd See the meat softens under the saddle and the horses bouncing will mix the curd for you The servant proudly showed Koja how it was done And I made tea master Hodj held up another bag After tea Koja once again took to the saddle Although the pace this day was no slower than yesterdays perhaps even faster it seemed less frenzied and chaotic The scouts resumed their patrols Operations began to function without the khahans hand guiding every detail By midafternoon Koja found himself riding with the khahan undisturbed by messengers and commanders Khahan I am wondering Koja began his curiosity coming to the fore once again We are well beyond the deadlands of Quaraband Why then do you ride and rely on scouts when simple magics could make everything much easier Priest Yamun answered count my army How many could I move by simple magic An arban A jagun Even a minghan What would they do Hold off the enemy until more arrived We ride because there are so many of us But surely the scouting could be done by spells Koja suggested Youve got some sight Yamun asked He reined back his horse to a slower pace a concession to the saddlesore priest A little yes As they slowed riders began to pass them churning up dust Kojas eyes smarted as the air grew cloudy Then tell me whats ahead beyond my eyesight Where Koja asked peering through the haze thrown up by the army Ahead priestthe way were going Yamun smirked pointing with his knout But theres so much ahead of us If you told me what I should look for Yamun broke into laughter If I knew what was there I wouldnt need your sight Koja clapped his mouth shut Embarrassed he rubbed his head keeping his eyes lowered See priest Yamun explained still laughing at Kojas embarrassment Thats why I use men and riders I send them out with orders to look and see Theyll ride back and tell me what they have found I learn more from soldiers than I ever will from wizards and priests Koja nodded pondering the lessons wisdom Besides Yamun concluded more darkly Id have to rely on Mother Bayalun for magic There was a silence between the two men although the world around them was hardly quiet A constant chorus of shouts song snorting whinnies and the steady droning thunder of horse hooves filled the air Why Koja finally asked unwilling to phrase his question completely Why what Yamun asked without turning Why does Mother Bayalun hate you Ah you noticed that Yamun reflected He snapped his mares reins urging the horse to go a little faster Koja had little choice but to follow pace The ride became rougher I killed her husband Yamun said in even tones when Koja had caught up with him once again You killed your own father the lama gasped in astonishment He fumbled with his reins trying not to drop his knout Yes There was no sign of remorse in the khahans voice Why There must be a reason I was meant to become the khahan What other reason is there Koja dared not speculate aloud Bayalun was the first wife of my father the yekenoyan Her son was to become the khan I was older but my mother was Borte the second wife In my sixteenth summer the prince was twelve and he died He fell from a horse while we were out hunting Yamun stopped as a messenger from the scouts rode toward him Yamun waved the man on to Goyuk You see I was destined to be the khahan even then Mother Bayalun though she accused me of killing the prince Yamun turned in his saddle to talk to the priest Did y Koja stopped himself realizing the question he was about to ask was hardly diplomatic Yamun eyed the lama sharply his gaze stabbing like ice She used her seers to convince the yekenoyan I did Even when the Hoekun were a small people she had great power with the wizards Yamun paused and scowled Anyway my father turned against me I escaped from his ordu taking only my horse and weapons I went to Chanars fatherTaidju Khanand he took me in and fed me He treated me like a son Thats when you and Chanar became anda Koja ventured No that was later Chanar didnt like me then He was afraid his father loved me more He was right Yamun stopped talking and spat out a mouthful of dust Unfastening a golden flask that hung on his saddle he swallowed a mouthful of mares milk Koja realized that his own mouth was thick and dry Still he didnt care to try the milk brew Hodj had prepared and the tea was all gone Taking the long cowl of his robe he wrapped it over his mouth and nose screening out some of the thick dust Taidju swore to help and gave me warriors from his own people We went back to the tents of my father One day he was riding with some of his men and I found him He wouldnt listen to me so we fought I couldnt shed his blood Why not Kojas voice was muffled The yekenoyan was royal blood Shedding his blood would be a bad omen Yamun explained as if he was talking to a child What happened Koja scratched at the top of his head paying close attention to the words I seized my father as he galloped by and we fell to the ground and wrestled I had to break his neck so I wouldnt spill his blood After he was dead I went to the Hoekun ordu with Taidjus people and declared myself the khan Yamun unconsciously mimed the actions as he spoke If Mother Bayalun created all the trouble why did you marry her Koja asked His horse became restless so he gripped the reins tighter Politics Custom She was powerful Yamun shrugged his shoulders Mother Bayalun has the respect of the wizards and shamans Through her they are protected I could not have her turning them against me Besides she realized that I was meant to be khahan So why does she stay in your ordu Exasperated Yamun snapped Why why why You ask too many questions Which snake is better the one in your talons or the one in the grass With that the warlord wheeled his horse toward Goyuk and called out Whatve the scouts seen Koja rode the rest of the day without seeing the khahan He worried that he had offended Yamun so he tried to occupy his mind by watching the surroundings The land was slowly changing The gently broken steppe was giving way to steeper harsher hills Small gorges cut through the dry and rocky ground Outcroppings of sandstone jutted through the surface in heavily eroded heaps Snow drifted into the hollows There were fewer patches of grass and more scrubby brush but it was probably only the result of twenty thousand horses passing through the countryside That night the army divided into a number of smaller camps Koja left Hodj to set out the rugs for another night under the stars The priest walked toward Yamuns oxcart brushing the dust from his clothes Greetings Khahan the priest hesitantly called to Yamun Sweatcaked dust clung to the rulers silken clothes Grime coated his face Yamun unceremoniously scooped a ladle of kumiss from a leather bucket and guzzled it down Food he ordered wiping the kumiss from his mustache with his sleeve He scooped up another ladle of the drink You dont sleep priest No Lord Yamun Koja said softly I waited to speak with you Then get on with it Yamun said gruffly I want to sleep He filled the ladle once more I ask to be your envoy to the prince of Khazari He spoke in a quick monotone trying to keep himself from panicking Eh Yamun stopped in midswallow looking sharply at Koja over the top of the ladle The priest straightened his robes and stood up a little straighten I want to be your envoy to the Khazari You You are Khazari he sputtered in surprise Khahan I know it is unusual Koja hurriedly continued shifting uneasily on his toes But I know my people and I have learned much about the Tuigan I am sure I can make them Yes yes thats fine Yamun said Still these are your people How do I know you wont betray me I owe you a life Koja answered simply What is the truth The khahan probed Not your rationalethe truth Koja sucked in his breath Because I want to save Khazari he blurted If you conquer what will you do with the country You have not made plans You know how to conquer but can you rule Koja clamped his jaws tight waiting for Yamuns outburst The khahan slowly returned the ladle to its bag He paused by the kumiss sack staring past Koja Finally he slapped his knout against the leather bag Ill think about it he announced at last his voice cold and unfriendly Now I am going to sleep We ride early in the morning By your word it shall be done Koja said with a trembling voice as he made a low bow The khahan had already turned away his heavy coat flapping around his bowed legs The next days ride was uneventful even tedious for the priest It seemed like a constant battle against minor irritationsbiting flies hunger and thirst Dust churned up by thousands of horses settled into everything To Koja it seemed that his robes crackled with the stuff Dust coated his scalp which now bristled and itched with a stubby growth of hair it caked on his eyelids and lined his throat The hot afternoon sun raised tiny drops of sweat that ran like mud down his arms All afternoon his horse thudded along in a monotonous pounding rhythm With the evening came a welcome relief from the jolting bonebreaking ride Koja gladly turned his horse a gray and yellow pony with an unmanageable urge to bite over to Hodj for the night The lama had taken to calling the horse Cham Loc after an evil spirit who fought the mighty Furo Relieved of his mount the priest decided to walk out the cramps in his muscles The army had camped in a bowlshaped depression where several streams flowed in together Koja climbed to the top of a small sandstone promontory on the edge of a steep hill His guards scrambled along behind him On the overlook the lama sat watching the sunset a brilliant band of redorange topped by a sapphireblue sky Koja was reminded of another time when as a child he sat at the edge of a towering cliff and watched the long shadows of the mountains fill his valley below From his vantage Koja could see the entire campsite spread out before him The fires clustered into small knots spaced almost evenly across the floor In between them were occasional clumps of moving darkness only a small part of the thousands of horses set out to graze for the night Each fire is a jagun explained one of the guards pointing toward the shimmering lights Koja looked out over the plain with a greater appreciation for the size of the army He guessed there were a thousand perhaps several thousand fires dotting the entire valley floor Absentmindedly he began counting the lights of the jaguns We must go now interrupted one of his guards before it gets too dark The sun had slid almost out of sight It cast so little light that Koja could barely see his blackrobed guards The priest climbed down from the rock heeding the suggestion Quietly he made for the fires of Yamuns camp The guards hurried after him carefully staying as close as was their duty but no closer As they approached Yamuns fire the guards stopped as they always did Koja went the rest of the way alone Tonight there was a small group around Yamuns fire just the khahan and a few of the noyans A kaychi a singer of stories was sitting crosslegged near the fire He was a young man smoothfaced with rounded features and a carefully groomed mustache and goatee Across his lap lay a small twostringed violin his khuur Are you at peace asked Yamun when Koja was within easy speaking distance It was a standard greeting that needed no answer Sit Koja took the seat offered him and accepted a cup of wine a quiverbearer poured The storyteller struck the first note on his instrument and then put his bow to it beginning his tale He sawed at his khuur madly as he sang His voice leaped from high quavering notes to hoarse growlings In a moment between the kaychis songs Koja turned to Yamun Khahan although I spoke rashly yesterday I ask you to consider my request The priest spoke softly so only the khahan could hear Yamun grunted In time priest in time I need to think about it Youll know in time The khahan pointed to the kaychi commanding the man to wait The singer set aside his instrument Yamun stood and raised his kumiss ladle to the other khans Our friendship has been raised The khans around the fire raised their ladles and repeated the toast That finished they got to their feet stopping long enough to kneel to the khahan Koja rose and after a moments hesitation knelt too Before the khahan could call him back he hurried away Returning to his own camp Koja crawled into the rugs and furs Hodj had laid out Within seconds of lying down the priest was sound asleep When he opened his eyes Koja was once again on the hilltop overlooking the valley watching the sun set over the army The colors were splendid more intense than he had ever seen them before The troops formed a black seething mass arching and humping over the ground The men fused and joined into a single being a freakish thousandlegged centipede then a dragon that coiled around and bit at itself The fires flared up becoming the pinpoints of its eyes Soundlessly it writhed and shuddered toward him Arms hands and horses heads heaved out of the mass and fell back Koja looked down at his hands held out in front of him They were covered with huge droplets of sweat He suddenly felt fear a fear that locked every joint in his body It is good to see you clever Koja said an emotionless voice behind him The fear was suddenly gone and the priest automatically turned toward the speaker His guards stood at the base of the rock upright and unmoving Beyond them standing on the slope was his old master Wrinkles lined the high lamas eyes but his face was bright and clear not ravaged by age He was dressed in the formal vestments used on the festival daysyellow flowing robes with a red sash over one shoulder a white pointed cone with flaring earpieces for a hat It has been some time since I saw you Koja the old man said Greetings Why master Quiet Koja the old master said softly cutting the younger man off Soon you must face the walls you have built walls stronger than stone There are secrets in walls buried deep beneath them Learn the secrets of your walls Koja came forward to grasp his teachers hand but the distance between them never closed The young priest opened his mouth to speak but the older lama droned on in a curious monotone now suddenly a voice not his own Your lord is called by one more powerful than he This spirit that calls him seeks aid Before you can do your part your lord will fear you are against him Be ready to prove yourself The figure turned to go What Which lord Who Which lord Wait Do not leave Tell me what I should do Koja shouted toward the fading figure The old lama didnt answer He only disappeared into the distance of the steppe Just as quickly as Kojas old master came he was gone The one who calls waits behind you The masters voice came drifting out of the darkness Koja sat alone staring into the ebbing light Behind him he could sense the creature clawing and scrabbling its way up the hill Its grasping hands were getting nearer reaching for him He wanted to turn but knew he couldnt The fear that locked his joints had returned The thing had reached the top of the rock Koja could not hear it or see it but it was there reaching for him Sweat poured down his face dripped off his fingers Something cold and reptilian lightly brushed his shoulder Koja jerked awake and sat bolt upright Hodj leaped back terrified at the effect his simple touch had had on his master The priest was wildeyed and panting his robes soaked in sweat Hodj stared at his master then turned back to his work with a slight shrug Without comment the servant brewed tea and set a cup before the priest He then began to prepare fresh bags of churned curd By the time Koja finished his tea Hodj had the horses ready for the days ride That day the army marched hard The normal pattern of riding then grazing was broken They stopped only once long enough for the men to milk their mares Hodj tended to this task while Koja took the chance to stretch his pained legs The respite was over all too soon We go shouted a yurtchi Servants hastily finished their work and ran back to their horses Almost as suddenly as they had stopped the horsewarriors were on the march again By now it was getting quite dark but the riders continued into the night With the sun gone the warriors took to guiding themselves by the stars They used the faint moonlight to pick their way along Throughout the entire mass of men only a few torches glittered Nothing shown as brightly as the khahans camp The great tent cart was illuminated for the first time since the journey began Bright light shone through the doorway blinking on and off as the door flap swayed A swarm of quiverbearers rode around the wagon carrying torches to light the way for messengers The nightguards hovered in the shadows ready to spring to their masters defense The army traveled long into the night Moonlit shapes swayed close then faded away into the darkness The snorts of the horses and soft conversations drifted through the night Occasionally there was a thud followed by a bitter cry or curse and a burst of laughter as a dozing rider fell from his saddle to the amusement of his comrades Koja lost track of time and place Master we stop Ive made your bed Hodjs voice soaked through the fog slowly bringing Koja back to consciousness The sun burned brightly overhead but the air still felt cold and thin The pain of twentyfour hours in the saddle burned through every one of the priests muscles wracked his back and twisted his hips Slowly his feet dragging over the ground the lama tottered toward his bed The images of his latest nightmare came silently to Koja Who is my lord he wondered Ogandi or Yamun Does it matter what I do the priests exhaustionnumbed mind finally asked No came the answer only sleep matters The decision made and eyes closed Koja pitched forward snoring almost before he hit the coverlets Chanar stared at the scene in front of him A translucent image of the army strung out over dusty hills filled the center of the tent Bayalun stood halfhidden by the moving images on the opposite side of the yurt Between them was a small glowing crystal the source of the magical scene So Bayalun Yamuns reached Orkhon Oasis Thereyou can tell by the cairn next to the spring Is it time Not yet We cannot be too obvious the second empress cautioned If we strike now the suspicion will fall on me and everything will be undone Now that were out of the deadlands we can watch them closely When the right time comesa battle or something elsethen my agent will act She walked through the image to Chanars side and placed her hand lightly on his chest Patience brave general Patience will reward us Chanars eyes moved from the mighty army before him to Bayalun and back again He bit his lip to restrain his impatient desire Soon very soon Bayalun assured him Until then have patience Manass Master Hodj said softly in his nasal voice Master the khahan wishes to see you Koja opened his eyes and discovered that he was looking at a broad field of night stars He blinked and scanned the sky In one direction the scintillating points swept as far as he could see Looking the other way the lights were blocked by a silverblack range of peaks mountains outlined by the light of the waning moon Lord Yamun summons you master Hodj repeated I hear Hodj Koja answered With his arms he slowly pushed himself up His shoulders and back were stiff and pained but not anything like the agony he had felt earlier Still he didnt think hed be leaping and dancing about for a while In fact moving with as little bending as possible seemed like a good idea Help me up Hodj slid an arm around the priest and pulled the thin lama to his feet Koja wavered there unsteadily lightly testing his weight on each leg before releasing the servant Satisfied that his knees were not going to buckle underneath him Koja took a few steps to gently stretch his cramped muscles While he did so Hodj hurried into the yurt to fetch clean clothes It took Koja a little while to realize this camp was different His yurt was raised He turned in a circle looking over the camp All around were shadowy moonlit domes the rounded shapes of the felt tents Small welcoming fires blazed on the dusty prairie among the tents Short squat Tuigan men wandered among the fires Drifting through the night came the wail of a band of musicians the scraping notes of the khuur and the rhythmic rattle of a yakhide drum A singer suddenly added to the cacophony wailing in the twovoice style peculiar to the steppe Somehow the man produced both a low nasal drone and a highpitched chant at the same time Koja was glad the musicians were some distance away as he had not yet learned to appreciate the finer points of Tuigan music It all sounded like the screeching of evil spirits or at least what Koja thought evil spirits sounded like since he had never really heard any screech Hodj came out of the tent with Kojas bright orange silk robe which the priest had packed away for the journey Although he found his masters insistence on clean clothing odd Hodj tried to do his best to fulfill the priests wishes He helped Koja pull the robe on over his travelstained garments It was too cold to take them off even though the clothes were caked in dried sweat dust and grease Finally somewhat presentable the priest set out for Yamuns tent On his way there Koja noticed that the soldiers seemed in a very different mood this night On the surface they were happy and cheerful but the priest sensed a grim and resolute mood underneath Around many of the fires men sprawled against their saddles drinking ladles of kumiss and swapping stories At one fire a thickmustached trooper held his sword between his legs and scraped along its length with his honing stone A bright glint of metal caught the priests eye at another fire There another soldier sat crosslegged a suit of armor stretched out in front of him It was a fine piece of workmanship with the same cut as the mans kalat but made of overlapping scales of polished steel He was carefully checking it over testing the strength of the stitching that held each metal scale to the thick leather backing Yamuns camp was larger and more elaborate than the previous nights The tentwagon was gone and instead Yamuns whitechalked yurt had been raised The khahans standard stood next to it Nearby was another tent almost as large patterned with black and white stripes A smaller standard unfamiliar to Kojaa pole topped with a silver crescent and a human skullstood outside its door There were more nightguards present than usual all in full Tuiganstyle armor and tensely alert Koja was hastily ushered into the khahans tent Yamun and another younger man sat at the yurts center leaning over a low table that had been set in front of them Trays at their side held cups of Tuigan tea and piles of gnawed bones The younger man stopped talking when Koja stepped through the threshold He turned and stared at the priest His face although similar to Yamuns was more pinched and less heavily lined His right cheek was badly pitted by the pox and a halfmoonshaped scar made a pale mark on his forehead Like Yamun the stranger had a red tint to his hair The mans locks were tied in two thick braids that dangled below his shoulders Silver and shell ornaments capped the ends of his braids The stranger wore a long tightfitting robe of black silk imported from Shou Lung and cut in the style of a troopers kalat Raised patterns woven into it gave the robe a shimmering texture Beaded red cords fixed in place with hammered silver bosses hung from his shoulders Embroidered across the front of the robe in red and gold was a serpentine and leaping dragon against a sea of brilliant blue and silver clouds A saber the scabbard covered with deep blue lapis lazuli hung from his broad golden belt Koja was surprised by this for few visitors were allowed to bear weapons within the khahans yurt Yamun didnt glance up as the lama entered instead continuing the discussion with the newcomer Your men are too close to the river Move your forward tumens back Set their camps between the two hills to the south Youll keep your own tent here Have your commanders report to me in the morning The younger man sat quietly noting all of Yamuns commands You summoned me Khahan Koja said kneeling on one knee with his head bowed Sit grunted the warlord pointing to a space alongside the table The younger man said nothing but watched Koja carefully as he took the place indicated Join us in tea historian Yamun said setting his own cup on the table This is Jadaran Khan commander of the great left wing Hes been here for a day waiting for us to arrive Koja realized the man sitting next to him the commander of the great left wing was Yamuns second son Prince Jad He turned and still seated bowed respectfully to the royal prince I am honored by the brilliance of the commander of the great left wing Koja lauded being as polite as he possibly could Enough of that interrupted Yamun Weve been talking while you slept Tomorrow my army rides to Manass You know this place Koja grew pale He nodded Manass is in Khazari Is it strong Prince Jad asked His voice was similar to Yamuns but with a nasal twang Yamun raised his hand in admonition to his son The prince instantly fell silent Is Manass your home the khahan asked casually as if making small talk No Lord Yamun Koja answered guardedly Then none of your clan is there Yamun said with finality Thats good Jad looked to Yamun to be sure he had permission to speak Who rules Manass he asked timidly Prince Ogandi of course answered Koja But he does not live there he quickly corrected Jad nodded Who then is the khan of this ordu How many tents does he have I do not know Koja said apologetically From Jads words he grasped that neither the prince nor Yamun really knew what Manass was They thought of it as a camp a collection of tents Kojas first instinct was to inform them of their error Just as he was about to speak he stopped his mouth open the words tumbling back down his throat They would learn the truth soon enough he decided It doesnt matter Yamun assured the priest pouring more tea Well see these things with our own eyes hear them with our own ears I wont ask my historian to speak against his people He raised his cup to the priest Ai I drink to my clever and wise friend Ai toasted Prince Jad his own cup raised They both noisily slurped at their cups of tea Ai echoed Koja a little less enthusiastic than the other two He sipped slightly at his cup drinking as little salted tea as possible Yamun set his cup firmly down on the table and leaned forward toward Koja His breath reeked with the smell of sour milk I ask my historian though to go to his people and give them a message Youve seen my people and how I rule them Tell your people how Im generous and kind to my friends Describe to them the wonders and riches youve seen Count out the size of my army for your leader A look of puzzlement crossed Kojas face Dont worry you have my blessing A thief cant steal what is already given Yamun wiped a drop of tea off his chin with the sleeve of his robe then continued And when you are done you must also tell this leader something Say he must recognize me as the Illustrious Emperor of All People and submit his city to me Koja swallowed hard when he heard the new title Yamun was claiming for himself Theyll never do that Tell the leader of Manass that if he doesnt submit Ill have him and all the members of his family killed Tell everyone that death is the punishment for those who defy me but that Ill spare those who do not resist And then you must return to me with the answer If you kill them who will rule for you Khahan You can conquer Khazari but what benefit will that be Koja steeled himself as he spoke Unless you have governors of your own you will need the rulers of Manass to keep the peace But But nothing The matter is decided Yamun snapped He sat upright his muscles tense Koja noticed that Jad was also stiff and hardfaced Now Yamun pronounced as he rose to his feet its time for you to go and rest This meeting is over You may return to your tent Koja of the Khazari The audience ended the priest quietly slipped back outside and returned to his yurt During the walk Koja pondered the surprising outcome of the audience Certainly the Tuigan warlord was wiser than it seemed Still now the khahans mind was set on Khazari Koja wondered if Yamun had planned beyond the conquest Perhaps he finally decided I can guide Yamun and protect Khazari at the same time In his tent Koja did not sleep well All night he awoke in fits wondering in the darkness what he should do What should he tell his fellow Khazari Recommend they surrender or urge them to fight He was a Khazari or at least he was when he started this trip but now he was not so sure If he told his people to surrender was he betraying them It was a puffy and redeyed priest who greeted the dawn the next day Even the brilliant golden sky that lit the jagged mountains of Khazari could not raise his spirits Seeing the peaks of his homeland only furthered his feeling of despair Reluctantly Koja joined the assembled company of Yamun Prince Jad guards quiverbearers and messengers The group mounted their horses and rode along a rising winding trail that led them up out of the valley and onto the high plain of Khazari By the light of day Koja looked down on Yamuns army With Jads arrival it had swelled to almost twice its number fifty or sixty thousand men The yurts filled the narrow valley floor and dotted among the tents were herds of horses Rings of pickets surrounded the camp At the head of the valley in the direction they were going a mass of men was forming up Rank upon rank of mounted warriors an entire tumen were preparing to march on Manass I brought you up here to see this These men come as proof of my word Yamun explained when he noticed Kojas worried look I dont think this ordu of Manass can withstand an entire tumen The khahan spurred his horse ahead angling to join the front of the column The troops assembled the tumen set out on the route to Manass They followed a road little more than a rutted path that had been used for centuries by the caravans from Shou Lungcaravans that could no longer cross through the great steppe From what Koja was able to infer the army was still a halfdays ride from the city The khahan was advancing on Manass with only a part of his army while other tumens were to cross the border at other mountain passes The small command group rode throughout the morning at the front of the tumen Yamun was preoccupied with his messengers and he gave a constant stream of orders A scribe rode at his side scribbling out the commands his paper balanced precariously on a little board that in turn rested across his saddle Koja wondered where the scribe came from or if the fellow knew the fate of his predecessors Jad rode well away from the priest surrounded by men of his own bodyguard At times the prince would ride over to have a word with his father but apparently had no desire to talk to the priest Koja didnt mind this He was not in the mood for company His own thoughts and concerns possessed him so much that he hardly even noticed the passage of time or the terrain they rode over The priest was struck with some surprise when the riders around him suddenly reined up short The party had just cleared the top of a small ridge The scouts in the lead came circling back toward the khahans dayguards Priest come forward Yamun shouted to Koja This was a moment the lama dreaded He lightly spurred his horse forward trotting it up to Yamun The guards moved away eyeing the surrounding hills suspiciously There announced the khahan standing in his stirrups He pointed down the slope toward the other side of the valley they had just entered A small river ran through the valley floor winding in lazy oxbows through tiny barren fields On the near bank of the river was the city of Manass its white limestone walls shining in the noontime sun Koja was surprised by what he saw of Manass It was much larger than he expected In tales the town was never as great as Hsiliang which was close to the border with Shou Lung or Skardu where Prince Ogandi lived Still Manass was described as one of the guardians against the raids of the mounted bandits who sometimes boiled out of the steppe Apparently Prince Ogandi considered the threat of barbarian raids a serious matter for Manass seemed well fortified The city was enclosed entirely within a wall Although it was difficult to be certain Koja guessed the main wall stretched more than a quartermile on each side to roughly form a square The fortifications were in good repair The main gate was large and closed by heavy wooden doors A gatehouse several stories in height was built over the entrance Other towers rose at the corners The walls of these were heavily plastered with whitewashed mud and the roofs were fireproofed by yellowbrown clay tiles A broad walk ran across the top of the wall and connected each tower to its neighbors Within the wall Koja could see a cluster of yellowbrown roofs broken by the gaps for streets The city was laid out in a regular grid the streets running in straight lines according to the advice of ancient geomancers earth wizards who came long ago from the great cities of Shou Lung Only occasionally was this orderly pattern broken perhaps on the advice of these soothsayers or maybe just to accommodate the needs of the citizens As Yamun and his party studied the city a faint sound came to their ears It was a long droning blast with overtones of a higherpitched whistle Koja recognized the sound from his years at the temple It was the wailing note of a gandan a huge straight horn It took a man with strong lungs to blow one of these instruments Outside the walls only a few farmers were in the field it being too early in the spring to start planting Those few however began a hurried rush to the safety of the citadel Well theyve seen us Yamun declared Go priest and deliver my message Take ten men from the dayguard as an escort Yamun didnt wait to see his orders executed but wheeled his horse about and set to the business of arraying his ten thousand There was only a little delay as the ten guards were assembled for the escort duty Koja sincerely wished the wait could have been longer but before long he was riding through the fields surrounded by the bodyguard One of them bore the yaktail standard of Yamun Khahan When they reached the gate to Manass it remained closed A deep bass voice hailed them from the gatehouse overhead State your business for entering the White City of Manass The sentry spoke in Khazarish Koja abruptly realized it had been weeks since hed heard the clipped sounds of his native tongue The bodyguard looked at Koja waiting for him to speak Unconsciously standing in the saddle in a futile attempt to get closer to the speaker in the gatehouse Koja called out in his thin voice I am an envoy of the Brilliant Shining White Mountain Prince Ogandi I am Koja lama of the Red Mountain Temple son of Lord Biadul son of Lord Koten I bring a message from the one who calls himself the Illustrious Emperor of All People the ruler of Tuigan Hoekun Yamun Khahan I come under a banner of truce Open your gates so I can speak with the governor of your city Koja waited for the gate to swing open The doors did not move Who are the men with you the voice shouted back They are my escort and bodyguard explained Koja Surely the mighty warriors of Manass are not afraid of ten men Koja didnt know about those in the city but he was certainly afraid of them He was more afraid however of the reception he might receive inside if the bodyguards were not present Do they come in with you A new voice was shouting out questions now Koja guessed a higherranking officer had taken over the negotiations The khahan of the Tuigan would consider it insulting if his men were made to wait outside Koja pointed out In fact he might suspect us of plotting against him Koja looked to the guards on either side They apparently had no understanding of what was being saidhe hoped Your guards must not draw their weapons Is that understood Yes Koja yelled back His throat was getting sore from all the shouting And there are to be no spellcastersunderstood Only myself Koja responded sitting back in his saddle and I am a simple lama of the Red Mountain There was a period of silence Koja shifted uneasily in the saddle looking to see how his guards were taking all this They sat still in their saddles waiting for something to happen Priest the voice called out Yes Know this Should you make the slightest sign to cast a spell you will be killed before you can complete it Is that understood The voice spoke the last with great emphasis It is understood Koja answered clearly There was a drawnout scraping noise as the gates were unbarred It ended with a loud clunk and then the massive wooden halves began to swing open With grunting strain a team of soldiers pushed the gate open wide enough for the riders to pass through Do not draw your weapons Koja charged his men or we will all surely die Remember your task is not to get me killed Inside the gate was a company of archers their weapons nocked and ready The men stood tensely lined up on one side of the street instead of both so their arrows wouldnt accidentally kill their own men if there was a fight The soldiers wore simple cotton robes dyed in blues and reds Koja suspected the robes covered armored suits of leather and mail Each man wore a pointed cap decorated with the brilliant green plume of some strange bird or beast At the far end of the line stood their commander He was easily identified by the gleaming suit of metal scales he wore Each scale had been polished to a sheen so that the officer sparkled wherever he went In the noonday glare his armor was almost blinding Welcome lama of the Red Mountain he said bowing slightly I am honored to be welcome Koja replied using his best diplomatic skills Koja cautiously urged his horse through the gate not wanting to venture too far into the city He was still very uncertain about the reception he might receive You and your men will leave your horses here instructed the gleaming commander Then you will accompany me to the governor Koja translated the officers words There was some grumbling from the men about leaving their horses Koja pointed out that if they did not they could not go any farther Reluctantly the troopers dismounted and handed their steeds over to grooms who appeared seemingly out of nowhere Follow me ordered the commander with little ceremony Watch fall in The archers slung their bows drew heavy curved knives called krisnasa favorite weapon of Khazari warriorsand took positions on either side of Koja and his escort The swarthy robed Khazari eyed the shorter Tuigan suspiciously and kept their weapons ready As he marched through the streets Koja studied the city Although hed never been to Manass its houses were much like the ones of the small village he grew up in They were larger here Most had one or two stories and were built from carefully stacked rocks The narrow side streets were clogged with goods left outsidejars too large to put anywhere else halffinished baskets even outdoor looms Doors and windows lined the street and curious eyes watched him from the shadows The streets remained empty as they marched through the town but the rickety wooden balconies that thrust out from many buildings did not Curious children and veiled women crowded on these threatening to bring the precarious structures crashing down with their weight Koja saw few men until the procession rounded a corner and entered a large plaza This was obviously the heart of Manass At the plazas far side was a broad low building whitewashed and brightly painted with bands of sutras done in vermillion cobalt yellow and green Koja recognized the writing and the style The scriptures were from a sect of the Yellow Temple rivals to the Red Mountain in power He read them to himself Bohda of the brilliant fiveflame heaven master of the thirteen secret words brought to the mountain by the KingWhoDestroyedBambalan so bow to the east The rest of the verse continued around the building out of sight Koja guessed that the inscription was a charm used to ward off evil magic and the evil spirits of the mountains The front of the building was dominated by a low portico that ran its entire length Men dressed in armorheavily padded coats of yellow and red that reached to the ankleand carrying wicked looking staffswords formed a wall at its base More men equally armed and armored stood in the narrow streets that entered the plaza blocking the other routes into the city Sitting on the portico near the center was a group of five men Koja bowed to the officials Foremost of the five was a tall slender man A banner behind him portrayed a multiarmed swordwielding warriorthe KingWhoDestroyedBambalan This ancient hero was the founder of Prince Ogandis line and was now revered as a a savior by the people The figure was the official seal of Khazari Koja assumed the slender man was the towns governor Just behind the governor was a man in loose draping robes of red and blue Stains and holes marred the brilliant colors of his clothing His hair was thick long black and unwashed In his hand he held a thin iron rod four feet long hung with chains and metal figurines Koja guessed he was a dong chang a wizardhermit from the high mountains Most of these men led reclusive lives seeking only to perfect their magical craft but sometimes they ventured out of their cold caves and returned to the civilized world Koja shuddered slightly when he looked at the man There were many stories about the dong chang few of them pleasant It was rumored they were actually dead creatures kept alive by their own meditations and practices The third man was clearly a scribe as indicated by the writing materials spread around him Koja quickly passed over him to study the remaining men on the stand The last two on the porch were a surprise to Koja even more than the dong chang had been It was obvious to Koja that neither man was Khazari They wore the long tightfitting silk robes of Shou Lung mandarins the bureaucrats of that great empire One seemed quite aged while the other was more youthful just verging on middle age The elder had a thin mustache and a fine wispy goatee both carefully groomed His hair was balding and faded and his eyes drooped in heavy wrinkles Age spots marked his cheeks and hands The younger mans features more clearly showed bis Shou heritage His face was not swarthy like those Khazari around him His hair was black and straight bound in a long queue He wore a small round hat with a long yellow tassel His face was serious and hard As Koja studied these men the guards that accompanied him from the gate slowly fell back forming up in two lines to block the street they had all just come up His own men moved to form a horseshoe around him open at the front Their hands went instinctively to their weapons No fighting hissed Koja when he noticed their movement Keep your weapons sheathed We shouldnt die like the staked goat before the tiger urged one of the men under his breath Better we fight If you do not touch your weapons the tiger will not strike Koja whispered back You will fail the khahan if we die Wait The troopers stood still but not a man lowered his hand You claim you are Koja of the Khazari said the governor from his seat You must be willing and able to prove this I am Koja assured the man standing as straight as he could It will cost you your life if youre deceiving me Manjusri make the test the governor ordered signaling his wizard to the front The dong chang stepped forward and raised his hands presenting the iron rod toward Koja The priests guards went for their swords Koja grabbed the wrist of the nearest man Wait he ordered The wizard waved the rod in circles and murmured a deep chant His eyes were closed There was a sudden puff of wind that fluttered the magicians robes and tossed his hair about Suddenly it stopped The hermit opened his eyes He speaks the truth Lord the wildhaired wizard pronounced The gaunt fellow returned to his place behind the governor Well then Koja of the Red Mountain I am Sanjar alMulk commander of this city in the name of Prince Ogandi State your message to me as if it were to him There was no tone of warmth or friendliness in the mans voice only a faint trace of sneering contempt and disgust for the priest in front of him Koja swallowed nervously and crossed his hands in front of himself I am a Khazari Come forward I cannot hear you ordered Sanjar Koja walked closer to the porch and began again shouting a little louder I am a Khazari like those of you here I bear you greetings from Hoekun Yamun khahan of the Tuigan who styles himself Illustrious Emperor of All Peoples He has sent me to you my people and my prince to deliver a message The words of the khahan of the Tuigan are this Submit to me and recognize my authority over your people or I shall raze your city and destroy all those who refuse me As Koja finished those words there was a murmur of shock and surprise from the men in the plaza Many eyes turned to Sanjar The governors face was purpled with rage and indignation Is that all this barbarian has to say he shouted in fury at Koja The priest wiped his sweaty palms on his robe No Lord Commander He also bids you to look over your walls from your highest tower Ive seen the reports from the sentries Your khahan has gathered himself a sizable force of bandits And now he wants to style himself Illustrious Emperor of All Peoples Hes got a lot to do before he can claim that title Sanjar sneered Does he really think he can capture Manass with that puny force Yes he does Lord Commander Sanjar snorted in derisive insulting laughter The old Shou gentleman at his side joined in though he veiled his smile behind a fan Koja bit his lip to refrain from speaking Sanjar was treating the whole thing like some great joke as if the khahan were some thieving buffoon or a common raider Although he knew the commander was making a grave error Koja found himself unwilling to speak up He didnt like Sanjar alMulk very much and trusted the Shou mandarin even less It is to be assumed that the brave khahan has chosen a time by which this insignificant city must reply asked the old Shou mandarin suddenly He spoke fluent Khazari but with a thick Shou accent The khahan of the Tuigan requests his answer by sundown today explained Koja The old man nodded Perhaps sometime tomorrow After all there is much to consider here the mandarin offered He made no effort to conceal his contempt The khahan is adamant The answer must be given today Koja waited to see what the governor would say The mandarin leaned over and whispered in Sanjars ear The governors smile was replaced by a grim scowl He stood up from his chair You will not have to wait so long This is my answer Kill them all except the lama Leave him alive to tell his impudent banditlord that Prince Ogandi finds the company of civilized men more to his taste Tell him injury to Khazari is injury to Shou Lung Let him think on that Koja was thunderstruck by Sanjars words What did he say priest demanded one of the Tuigan sensing the threat in the governors words The lama roused to action Quickly Koja shouted in Tuigan to his guards Defend yourselves His words were almost unnecessary for the Tuigan were already in motion They sprang back leaping on the guards who blocked the way back to the gate The sergeant of the arban shouted out commands to his men driving them like a wedge toward the wall of guards in their path The lead warrior feinted a high cut and then suddenly shifted it thrusting his sword under the Khazaris guard The sharp steel slashed through the soft armor and sliced into the mans arm shearing down to the bone The Khazari screamed as his sword dropped his arm now useless The other Tuigan hurled themselves into the attack hoping that sheer fury and surprise would carry them through Koja stood flatfooted as the warriors swept past him He had never been in a real fight before The speed of the battle stunned him The Tuigan slashed deeper into the ranks of the guards Several Khazari were already down One lay clutching at his throat his blood soaking the ground Another had crawled out of reach clutching at his belly trying to keep the gaping gash across his abdomen closed Two others lay unmoving Steel rang against steel harsh gasps and pants punctuated the battle Already the guards were starting to waver as the small band of Tuigan drove forward Stop them shouted Sanjar his voice screeching with rage Dont let them get away Suddenly Koja heard a droning murmur behind him He wheeled about just in time to see the dong chang shake his iron rod in the direction of the battle As the wizard finished the spell a paralyzing force settled over the lama He tried to fight it calling on the inner strength his master had taught him to use In his mind he chanted sutras of power focusing his thoughts to a single point Then just as suddenly the paralysis was goneand so was the noise of battle Looking cautiously behind him Koja saw his Tuigan escort and some of the Khazari guards frozen like statues Each man had been caught in the grip of a magical rigor locking him in place Some were lunging others parried A few had fallen over their weight offbalance when the spell struck Not one of them twitched blinked or moved in any way Around their feet was the blood of their opponents still flowing Koja felt his knees go weak Excellently done Manjusri the governor said rising from his seat Let the lama take the soldiers heads back as our answer Then hang the bodies from the gate Several men ran forward with their krisnas to carry out the grisly task Retreat The screech of wood on wood signaled the closing of the main gate behind Koja The Khazari had seated the lama backward on the horse and with a slap on the rump sent the beast galloping out the gate The priests hands were tied behind him fastened to the pommel and bags hanging from the saddle squished and thudded softly against his legs In these sacks were the heads of his Tuigan escort The blood soaked through the fabric and onto the hem of his robe As he watched Manass recede Koja heard horses coming his way There was a jerk at the reins and the horse stopped A knife cut away Kojas bonds Freed he practically leaped from the saddle animated by fear and anger While he stood there the troopers remounted leading his horse with them Before Koja could protest one man leaned down and hauled the priest up behind him Then wheeling their horses the troopers galloped back toward the Tuigan lines In the time it took Koja to deliver the khahans message Yamun had been busy The ridge where the horsewarriors had entered was now a solid line of men and horses The riders were packed three sometimes four ranks deep The different standardspoles with banners tails golden ornaments and carved totemsthrust up throughout the lines Each marked the position of a different commander Kojas rescuers quickly rode past the ranks of hardbitten campaigners The priest marveled at the nonchalance of the men who were likely to soon be in battle Some slept at their mounts feet while others drank and boasted of the great deeds they would do today Most of the men simply watched and waited Galloping forward the troopers delivered Koja to the khahans banner set in the center of the long line Yamun sat on a pure white charger his son on a white mare at his side The troopers opened the sacks and laid out the heads of Kojas escort for Yamun to see Some of the dead faces stared at him while others had their eyes closed Yamun stared back at the heads rage building inside him What happened the khahan demanded tersely Koja told of the meeting while Yamun strode up and down the line looking carefully at each head The priest could see the look of hatred twist Yamuns visage The Tuigan turned to his scribe as the priest described the last moments of the battle See that their widows and children are taken care of for the rest of their lives the khahan ordered speaking in a tight controlled voice The scribe took down the words and sent a runner to learn the dead mens names Cover them up Yamun ordered and then he wheeled back on Koja Where are their bodies Yamun demanded of the lama The governor ordered them hung from the gate Koja spoke softly out of respect for the dead Then this is his answer Yamun mused grimly The question was rhetorical and Koja made no effort to answer it We attack He turned and strode back to his couriers Sound the horn Send in Shahins minghan The standardbearer ran to the front of the line There he dipped Yamuns war banner with its horsetails and gold five times to the east At the same time another messenger blew three sharp blasts on a rams horn On the east flank one of the banners a silver disk hung with blue silk streamers dipped five times A line of one thousand horsemen broke from the front and trotted down the slope into the valley Even with his limited battle experience Koja knew a thousand men couldnt take the walls of Manass The thick gate was soundly closed so the riders would not be able to gallop in and they carried no ladders to scale the walls Their lances were useless against the hewed stone In his mind Koja could see the attack the warriors would gallop forward shooting their bows from horseback aiming at the top of the wall Few of their shots would find a target Most would only shatter against the stone The archers in the towers and the battlements would wait allowing the riders to come closer and finally draw back their bowstrings and let loose a flight of arrows The sharp points would cut down the riders like barley under the scythe just as the governor had promised Koja rode over to where Yamun was hearing the latest reports from Quaraband Lord Yamun those men are certain to die the priest shouted pointing to the attackers on the valley below They were now riding at a gallop I know he answered without looking up This report says Chanar hasnt left Quaraband yet How long ago did you ride he queried a pockfaced messenger Two days Great Lord answered the messenger breathlessly But your men Koja urged in alarm pointing toward the valley Theyre all going to die Be ready to return faster than you came Now go eat the khahan warned Yamun didnt react to Kojas words The messenger bowed in his saddle and trotted his horse away As he left Yamun finally turned his attention to the lama Priest you may be wise but you have much to learn Yamun said in irritation I ordered Shahin to go forward so we can count their arrows You did very poorly at noting their strengths so Shahin must go Count their arrows You mean hes supposed to learn the strength of Manasss garrison How Watch Yamun instructed He walked his horse forward urging Koja to come along The pair rode to where the standardbearer stood From that spot they had a clear view of the valley floor Watch and learn how we fight Koja looked down on Manass Shahins riders had assembled just out of bowshot of the walls The distant thumping of the minghans war drum echoed up from the fields The riders grouped themselves into wedgeshaped jaguns Shahin marked by his standard sat toward the center of the line The standard waved to the right and then dipped There was a ragged shout and the right wing of riders broke away galloping madly toward the walls Koja watched in fascinated horror The Tuigan were riding to certain doom Before the charging men had covered even half the ground to the walls victims of the Khazari archers started to fall A man swayed and wobbled in his saddle a horses front legs buckled somersaulting horse and rider under the hooves of another charging steed The bass roar of the hooves was punctuated by the faint screams of beasts and men The khahan watched the battle intently his face impassive to the death below This is suicide Koja cried angrily his own frustration at the pointlessness of the deaths welling up in his chest Of course Yamun said not even trying to defend his actions But now I learn the enemys strengths and weaknesses See look how many have died in the charge You sent them out so you could count the dead Koja gasped in disbelieving horror Yes From this Ill know the skill of Manasss archers See how many times they fire How they stand on the wall Yamun turned his horse and rode back to the main camp Koja stayed forward unable to tear himself away from the deadly farce below He was stunned that Yamun Khahan the great leader of the Tuigan a man who had conquered so much of the steppe would use his men so callously On the field below the first wave of soldiers was returning from its charge Dead men and horses marked the course of their attack Wounded horses thrashed on the ground or hobbled back toward the line Dismounted riders scrambled over the battlefield such as is was rounding up mounts and galloping back to their fellows Even before the right wing had finished forming the signal was given and the left wing charged The hideous cycle repeated itself The riders galloped forward falling as before This time the priest watched them carry their attack to its conclusion Suddenly a little over half the distance covered the horsemen pulled up wheeling their horses about As they spurred their mounts back toward their lines each man fired an arrow over his back There was a faint singing hum as the volley flew on its way A few of the men on the walls tumbled and fell some flopping over the battlements but far too few when compared to the losses of the riders Still Koja could only marvel at the foolish bravery and skill of the Tuigan Yamun returned as the last charge straggled back from Manass A horn blared sounding a recall of Shahins men Forming into ragged groups the riders began to gather up the wounded and straggle back to the safety of the Tuigan lines As they withdrew from the battlefield the gates of Manass opened and a continuous stream of riders poured out Amazingly the Khazari raced out from the safety of the walls chasing small knots of exhausted Tuigan thinking the riders were broken Shahins warriors kept their nerve retreating just ahead of the fresh enemy Here and there Khazari knights overtook their prey and overwhelmed the Tuigan troopers but the bulk of Yamuns men avoided death Koja marveled at the discipline and control of the troopers There were no signs of rout or panic You said the lord of Manass promised to ride us down didnt he Yamun suddenly asked Koja Yes Khahan Koja answered shading his eyes to make out what was happening below Then this lords a fool Yamun stroked the neck of his mare I need a plan If only General Chanar were here Koja was surprised at the mention of the khan How so Lord he questioned Chanars a fox historian Hes a clever one on the battlefield Between us I know wed have a plan The khahan studied the battlefield below stroking at his mustache as he thought The Khazari riders had ridden well beyond the range of their bowmen on the walls They rode helterskelter apparently out of the control of their commanders Abruptly Yamun sat up straighter in the saddle and a cold smile came to his lips Signal the men off the ridge out of sight he shouted to the standardbearer Then signal Shahin to get back here The khahan wheeled his horse about and trotted back to the khans waiting at his camp Koja followed curious as to what the khahan was up to Khans Ive a plan Well move the men off the ridge Then we attack with three minghans There was a gasp among the khans Three thousand men cannot win Goyuk said with a scowl across his wrinkled face It is not good Yamun Tomorrow is when well win Remember the battle at Bitter Well Yamun hinted Goyuks face brightened Into the tent the khahan ordered bustling the surprised warriors into his yurt Koja stepped to follow but a pair of guards stepped into his path Before Koja could call for the khahan to intercede the door flap fell shut The meeting went on for almost an hour during which time messengers came and went While he waited Koja saw the troops shift and move their lines making a show of retreating from Manass When the meeting finally ended the khans hurried to their positions Yamun and Jad were busy with reports and messages making it impossible for Koja to question either man The priest could only guess what would happen next Finally Yamun ordered a seat prepared on the ridge Koja followed behind waiting for events to unfold Now ordered Yamun as he looked over the valley A signal blared behind Koja The standardbearers ran forward again and waved their poles There was a rumble of shouted commands jingling harnesses and drumming hooves as more troops began to stream down the slope The late afternoon sun was falling low in the sky by the time the three minghans three thousand men reached the fields outside Manass Koja was confused and curious He still didnt see how without siege equipmentladders ropes and the likeYamun hoped to breach the walls of Manass Perhaps there was something the lama didnt know about warfare It looked to him like a foolish waste of lives This attack would fail leaving more dead and wounded What could Yamun intend by these hopeless attacks the lama wondered Koja could not contain his curiosity anymore Perhaps in his role as historian the priest could learn Yamuns plans He strode through the throng of messengers seeking out the khahan for some type of explanation As he came forward he was surprised to be greeted by the hulking Sechen and another guard of the Kashik You will come with us Khazari said the wrestler The guards voice was hard and tinged with an unpleasant threat Koja decided not to argue The khahan has given orders for you to be confined to a yurt You will come with us Sechen drew a knife meaningfully But Ive done nothing protested Koja You are Khazari Come with us or die The guards flanked him each taking one arm Resigned and more than a little fearful for his safety Koja allowed himself to be whisked away The guards placed him in a small empty yurt Koja had no idea where his servant or his belongings were Sechen and the other man took position outside the door Koja with little else to do sat near the door trying to glimpse the activity outside and listen to whatever he could hear For a long time nothing in particular happened Then as the sun was almost set he heard a familiar thunder Horses a large number of them were on the move Soon the noise grew louder and louder Koja could only imagine the scene on the other side of the ridge The minghans were advancing with the setting sun at their backs to blind the archers on the walls The lama strained to hear more Faintly echoing through the dusk were the blasts of horns and the deep staccato roar of war drums A ringing higher note rose above the lower rumble At first Koja could not place it then he realized that it was the sustained cries of screaming horses and men The battle for Manass had been joined and all Koja could do was listen The noise continued for about an hour after sunset gradually growing fainter and less insistent Koja sat still rapt by every crash cry and wail that reached him The battle was a failure the lives were wasted he was convinced of this He imagined the ground outside Manass was strewn with gutted horses and broken men Koja choked back an involuntary sob at the thought of the suffering pointlessly inflicted This was Yamuns vision of conquest It was a dream filled with blood valor and death but nothing more Koja wondered if this the futile attack on Manass was really what Yamuns god had shown the khahan in that thunderstorm Was this what Yamun wanted Before today the priest thought Yamun would conquer Khazari He also had been sure that Yamun could somehow be persuaded to leave it unharmed and safe Koja had tried to hint and suggest the possibilities for peaceful rule What hope was there of that now If the khahan was willing to send his own men to certain death Koja knew Khazari could expect no mercy from the Tuigan warlord Images of the dream came back to him as he began pacing around the yurt His old master had talked of his lord and the strange creature claimed Koja was with the khahan Who was his lord Prince Ogandi had sent him as ambassador to the Tuigan The khahan had sent him as ambassador to the Khazari Now he was a prisoner Koja felt lost the events of the day casting his own actions into doubt There was no treaty between the Tuigan and Khazari as a result of his actions Instead there was an army on the border of his homeland He as envoy had failed his prince Exhausted the lama sat back down and prayed to Furo for guidance silently whispering his sutras as he sat huddled near the door Finally Koja realized what he must do As a lama of the Enlightened One Koja must guide the khahan to be a true ruler more than just a warlord His decision made Koja strained to hear any sounds of the struggle but the tumult of battle had ceased Koja sat patiently until sleep finally settled over him The guards came and woke the lama during the night It was dark and bitterly cold in the thin mountain air and Koja was shivering from the instant he awoke Quickly ordered Sechen come with us The lama groggily heard the words without really understanding them The guard grabbed him by the arm and pulled him to his feet Its time for you to go Go where Koja managed to ask as the Kashik pushed him through the doorway His bodyguards were being none too kind Away Were leaving Sechen offered as explanation It didnt tell Koja much The guard pushed the priest toward a horse Servants were already setting to the task of taking down the yurt Indeed the camp seemed to be astir but in an oddly silent way The normal sounds of breaking camp the grunted shouts clatter of cups even the braying of camelswere all missing The men even his guards spoke in hushed tones The fires normally blazing were damped to the lowest coals I would like to see the khahan Koja declared as he became more aware of where he was You will answered a guard much to Kojas surprise A servant held the horse for Koja to mount What is going on Koja demanded one more time Somehow he suspected the question was futile Be quiet Sechen hissed The other guard nodded in agreement smiling with a mouthful of crumbling decayed teeth They roughly hoisted the priest into the saddle and then mounted their own horses The big wrestler reached over and took Kojas reins leading his horse along There was no clopping of horses hooves the pace was marked instead by a soft plodding Koja looked at the lead horse and saw that its hooves were wrapped in bindings of rags Wherever the army was going they were taking great efforts to do it quietly The group rode in the darkness for some time going mostly downhill All around Koja could hear the quiet movements of other riders Shapes moved in and out of his vision The lama wondered if they were moving to Manass Had it against all possibilities fallen to Yamuns attack or was the khahan secretly reinforcing whatever remained of the three thousand men already encamped outside As the hours went by the priest became confused They traveled too long to be going to Manass even though they went slowly With the dawn Sechen and his fellow guard finally came to a halt They were on the edge of a rocky bluff overlooking a flat valley floor A line of birches marked the course of a small stream that cut through the valley Behind Koja were more trees making the tops of the low mountains dark bluegreen in the morning light While Sechen watered the horses another nightguard came with a message for the wrestler The khahan orders you to send the priest to him was all the man had to say In a very short time Koja found himself in Yamuns camp The Khazari priest expected the camp to be like a furious beehive of activity with Yamun hearing reports and issuing orders couriers galloping in and out and commanders plotting out strategiesjust the way he imagined any great leaders camp must be during times of battle When he got there however he was astonished Yamun Khahan his son Jad and the old Goyuk were all sitting on stools drinking hot cups of Tuigan tea Slightly off to the side was a wrinkled old wizard In the weak light of the dawn the sorcerer looked drawn and lean radiating an otherworldly feeling Perhaps it was the effect of spending a life steeped in strange magics Koja knew that the arcane arts took a toll on their masters sometimes even draining them of vitality Like the others the wizard was sipping a cup of tea although he did not join in the muted conversation Instead the wizard sat close enough to their circle to listen but looked the other way watching the sun rising over the icefrosted peaks of Khazari Yamun and his companions did not appear to be hurried or concerned rather more like a group of men relaxing before a hunt They looked up noting Kojas presence Jad made a show of watching the tree line while old Goyuk smiled his bland smile and noisily sucked up his tea Yamun stood as Koja came closer to the circle Welcome he said evenly Koja could not guess what Yamuns temperament was Sit Have some tea Koja dutifully took his place trying to decide how he was being treated In just a day hed been a diplomat a prisoner and nowwell he just didnt know So many things had been going on and none of them seemed to make sense Khahan he inquired am I your prisoner or your envoy Koja chose his words with care trying not provoke the khahan into some rash action In my land you are my historian Yamun explained rubbing at his chin In Khazari you are Khazari Some of my khans think you are a clever spy for your people I do not want them worrying about you Koja stammered Butbut Great Lord you sent me to Manass to deliver your ultimatum just yesterday Yes but remember you asked I thought you could persuade them to be reasonable The khahan took Koja by the arm and led him away from the others You didnt And you came back with ten dead men There have been questions Questions Kojas voice hardened in unexpected anger They are groundless and insulting Yamun assured him But there are questions so you have me confined Koja said a trace of bitterness in his tone Yes Yamun said simply It was for your own safety My own safety Yamun Koja asked skeptically irritated at the suggestion If you wander about before a battle people think you are a spy If you dont no one kill you Is good plan chortled Goyuk interrupting from the other side of the circle The old man seemed to be in a particularly good mood this morning Koja mulled over the old generals words There was some sense to them but he still wondered if Yamun had some other reason for his confinement What happened last night I heard sounds of fighting the priest questioned trying a different subject Are you the khahans man or Prince Ogandis man Jad interrupted He stood watching Koja carefully The princes eyes were dark and hard Finally the priest broke the stare stealing a look toward Yamun The group fell silent waiting for Koja to answer Yamun settled back on his stool fingering a small knife while he watched the priest carefully Goyuk did a poor job of pretending to be interested only in his tea but he too watched the nervous lama from the corner of his eye Only the wizard looked away seemingly unconcerned Still Koja could see the mage flexing his wrinkled hands the long fingers practicing the motions needed to cast a spell Koja tried to consider his choices carefully but his mind was filled with memories that tugged and pulled against each other There were the oaths of loyalty he sworeto Ogandi to the Red Mountain Temple to the god Furo There was his father sitting next to the fire in wintertime then Yamun bending over his pallet and Chanars hatefilled glare Overriding all these images was the dream of his old master standing in the darkness building walls I have no lord he whispered The memories faded from his mind Jad relaxed but showed no pleasure in the priests words Yamun stirred and stepped forward He laid one hand on his sons shoulder and the other on Kojas My historian is an honest man Liars never say no fools never say yes he quoted looking at Jad Ai agreed Goyuk He raised his cup high and then took a long noisy slurp Ai To our success today pronounced Yamun letting the two go Jad found his cup and raised it in a toast Koja fumblingly found his own cup and raised it up The men sat and drank another cup of the hot tea Even Koja was thankful for the salted brew It soothed his tired tense nerves The priest had no idea what was to happen this day but for now he was content to wait Finally Yamun spoke Its time to get ready Jad and Goyuk nodded in agreement and stood Goyuk take command of the right My son you lead the left Ill take the center You Afrasib he commanded pointing at the wizard will stay with me As will you Koja Where are we going the lama asked hesitantly hoping that he might now get an answer It is time to put my plans in motion was all that Yamun would say The Trap Yamun Khahan paced along the bottom of the dusty gully kicking at stones and scraping little patterns in the dirt with his toe Occasionally he stopped and marched up the slope and stood at the edge of the tree line to gaze across the plain To his left and right sheltered in the gully were two thousand horsemen huddled below the level of the plain In preparation for the coming conflict Yamun wore his battledressa glittering steel breastplate engraved and chased with flowers a leather skirt sewn with metal plates and a golden pointed warhelm A coif of chain mail hung from the back of the helmet covering his neck The metal draped on Yamuns body clinked as he walked For the last three hours or more the khahan Afrasib Koja and a host of troopers had waited more or less patiently in the gully The dry wash ran a jagged course coming down out of the hills to the north and then angling to the southwest where the mouth of the valley opened into the broader fringes of steppe A thin stand of willows and tamarisk lined the banks giving shade to the weary men Koja tired of watching Yamun pace and tired of waiting sat against the base of a tree Sechen stood nearby never letting the priest get far from him Even in the shade Koja was sweating The big wrestler had found a suit of armor for the priest a heavy thing of metal plates stitched to leather in the style common to the Tuigan The armor was illfitting with absurdly big shoulders and long droopy sleeves but Sechen had insisted that he wear it You might be hit by an arrow the guard warned The helmet Sechen had produced fit little better than the armor Koja watched as the khahan turned from the plain and came back down the embankment Yamun fretted back and forth impatient for something to happen Why do we wait here Khahan Koja asked as Yamun ventured close Yamun stopped short by Kojas question scowled at the priest and almost snapped a sharp reply Then he relented We wait here to capture Manass historian At least that is the plan Manass Koja asked amazed He struggled to his feet the armor scraping against the tree trunk Here But how Theyre going to enter the trap Yamun answered marching back to the gullys edge Koja noticed that the khahan spoke with less than his usual absolute conviction The warlord looked to where Koja stood Come here priest Koja joined the khahan walking awkwardly in the heavy armor Yamun pointed toward the upper end of the valley where the land rose to a low pass nestled between the mountains to the east The trail to Manass crawled over the pass Look there Yamun instructed pointing to a spur that ran down into the valley floor from the north See the dark line Thats Jad and his men Koja squinted barely able to see the line Yamun indicated Years scanning the emptiness of the steppe had sharpened the khahans eyesight far beyond Kojas Goyuks men are across the valley near those trees Yamun continued as he swept his hand across the plain stopping on a wooded slope If you say so Khahan Koja responded unable to see any sign of troops there But you are here and Manass is far away I do not understand how you plan to conquer the city by fleeing from it Manass will come here if all goes as planned the khahan murmured his head sank to his chest Lifting his chin he continued in a stronger voice We will bring Manass here historian How You told me how the lord of Manass acted He calls us bandits Yamun answered turning away from the plain So I act like a bandit He looked at Koja The lamas expression showed he was still confused Yesterday I attacked and loston purpose Yamun held up his hand stopping the startled outburst Koja was about to make Not many men died Their orders were to make it look good and then flee This morning I left one troop near Manass to lure the garrison out make them pursue I just hope Shahin Khan can do the task If Chanar were here I know theyd follow Theres nobody better for baiting the enemy He gave the lama a wan smile But why should the garrison leave the city walls Koja asked He shrugged the oversized armor back into place Their commander is foolish Yesterday when Shahin retreated the Khazari left their walls and chased our men They did not have to so last night I made a feint My bandits attacked Manass and failed Yamun pointed toward the ridge This morning the Khazari see a retreating enemy They will chase Shahin hoping to destroy him Yamun stopped and look off his helmet Sweat ran down the back of his neck If thats not enough Shahin has orders to burn whatever he comes across near the city That will force the lord of Manass to come out He must protect his herds and his people Yamun wiped the sweat from his forehead He would be disgraced if he hid behind walls of stone From what Ive seen hell want to fight After all were only bandits Yamun set his helmet firmly back in place And then probed Koja Then Shahin lures the Khazari here Yamun stated calmly Shahin will ride past us and we will stay hidden On the signal my men strike the Khazari on the flank while Jad and Goyuk close in from behind And if no one chases Shahin Koja asked Then Ive guessed wrong about the lord of Manass Yamun answered He would be wise to stay home but he will come The khahan scanned the horizon as he spoke Koja waited for Yamun to dismiss him Finally the khahan turned to other details Koja went back to his tree and tried to settle in for a nap Although the lama was tired sleep wouldnt come Flies buzzed lazily overhead Another hour went by without Shahins arrival The morning was slowly becoming a hot spring day There was nothing for the priest to do but wait and pray They come Yamun Khahan panted a messenger who ran up and knelt at the great lords feet The scouts signal that Shahin is coming Yamun turned from the man waving forward another messenger Go to Prince Jad Tell the prince his father reminds him not to move until the signal is given The messenger hurried to his task At the announcement Koja scrambled to his feet Things are almost ready Yamun eagerly explained Shahins done it Now all we need to do is close the trap The khahan strode up the gullys side and watched the pass Khahan will this be dangerous the priest asked joining Yamun So far Koja had only seen battles never been in one Of course Yamun replied All battles are dangerous The khahan shaded his eyes and continued to watch ignoring his historian May I cast some spellspurely for protection I am not a warrior No Sechen growled stepping forward to guard Yamun No spells The muscular wrestler glowered down at the priest Koja lurched back in surprise Realizing what he had done Sechen suddenly stepped back and knelt at Yamuns feet Forgive my anger Great Lord I was only trying to guard you Yamun studied the man carefully You mean well Sechen he said reassuring the fretting giant Turning to Koja Yamun said Youll take your chances with the rest of us No spells The decision made Yamun climbed a small rise of crumbling rock Koja and his guards in tow to get a better view Koja reached the top with sweat running down the sides of his glistening stubbly scalp Theres Shahin Yamun abruptly said He pointed to the far ridge Shielding his eyes Koja could barely make out a thin sliver of moving gray The khahan scrambled down the slope and headed for his standard waving his arm to bring the army to attention Koja panting and sweating even more stumbled down behind him By the time the khahan reached his standard messengers were already starting to arrive Yamun pushed his way through the crowded gully past the expectant troopers As he did so a messenger ran forward and dropped to one knee Jad reports that his men are in position the man called out Good Standardbearer use the white banner for the right Yamun commanded without breaking his stride The trooper bowed quickly to show his understanding Scouts say Goyuk is ready added one of the khahans aides He was little more than a boy perhaps fourteen or fifteen years old His face was still round with baby fat Why hasnt Goyuk reported this Yamun snapped the aide falling in beside him They squeezed past a knot of horses eagerly pawing at the ground The troopers stroked the animals muzzles trying to calm them I dont know Lord answered the aide apologetically Then find out the gruff warlord growled Shahin has reached the valley floor Great Lord yelped a messenger who galloped up to the top of the gully Yamun stopped and scrutinized the man as the courier swung from the saddle Whos your commander the khahan queried Buzun One of Shahin Khans men Great Lord the man hastily answered falling to one knee Streaks of sweat colored the dust on his clothes One braid of the mans hair had come undone and the other was caked with grease and dirt His eyes were staring and hollow from lack of rest What of the enemy the khahan demanded as he walked up the slope to question the man Does Shahin have anything else to report The garrison is chasing him half a mile behind maybe a little more Great Lord No more than a mile the messenger said Koja climbed up to where the warlord stood How many men chase Shahin pressed Yamun Three minghans of riders Two of men on footbut they are farther behind Damn Yamun grumbled They cant be allowed to escape He wheeled to his aides Send riders to Jad and Goyuk Tell them not to attack until after the footmen pass by Theyre to give a signal the war drums when the infantry is in the trap Well hold our attack until they signal You Yamun turned back to the messenger Go back to Shahin and tell him to harry the riders slow them up I want the enemy pushed tight together Tell Shahin his losses are not important The messenger bowed quickly fired by the khahans urgency Get this man a fresh horse Yamun bellowed down to his aides in the gully Yougive him your horse He jabbed his finger at the nearest trooper Startled and flustered the man dropped to his knee By your word it soumso shall it be he shouted The man led the horse out of the gully bowing to the khahan at every step Yamun turned back to the messenger Go I want those Khazari chasing Shahin in full pursuit Understand Yes Khahan the man shouted scrambling to his feet Yamun didnt even wait for the courier to leave before he turned his attention to the lines of troops filling the gully Give the word he told the aide still at his side Its time to prepare Those simple words had an electrifying effect on the army There was a murmur of voices as the order was passed along then a chorus of creaking leather and metal Men hustled up off the ground where they had been lounging Saddle cinches got a final tug Honing stones were dragged in one last scrape along already sharp swords Heavy stifling armor was pulled on Kumiss bags gurgled as veterans poured themselves a drink there was no telling when they would have another chance Horses pawed at the ground shifting unsteadily under the sudden load of metalclad men A whisper of chanted prayers drifted on the wind Like a wave on the ocean men mounted their horses the action flowing outward from the khahans word Then they waited waited for the ninetailed banner of the khahan to be raised high and the war drum to be sounded These were their signals and not a man would move until they were given Those that rode forward too early would be beaten Those that fled beheaded Koja climbed into the saddle of his own horse a cumbersome task in the oversized armor that he wore The scale mail bagged out around his chest giving him the appearance of a large metalplated balloon or with his pointed helmet an upsidedown top The helmet promptly slid forward and smacked against the bridge of Kojas nose The weight of the armor on his shoulders was crushing Koja uncomfortably shifted in the saddle He knew a warriors life was not for him Yamun rode to Kojas side unable to suppress a devilish grin at the priests comical appearance Theres going to be a battlemore than I planned Shahin will need help in holding the cavalry long enough for the infantry to be caught in our trap the khahan explained Youre to ride with me where the guards can protect you Even so you may have to fight Koja pushed the helmet off his face Im no warrior he protested It is against the teachings my temple to harm another I cannot risk offending my god Khahan I cannot fight Then you can get your head smashed in The enemys not going to be so fussy the warlord pointed out Here take this He held out a heavy metalstudded club It doesnt take much to use Just dont bash your horse in the head The scowling warlord grabbed Kojas wrist and slipped the weapons thong over his hand Keep that on so the mace doesnt go flying the first time you swing it The weight of the mace pulled Koja to one side A hand grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back into the saddle A sharp snicker came from behind him Koja turned in time to see a dayguard laughing at him There was something about the look of the man that disturbed him something not quite correct The mans face didnt seem quite human Koja blinked and wondered if exhaustion and sunlight were playing tricks on his eyes Noticing the priests stare the dayguard quickly slipped behind a horse and disappeared from sight Mounted Yamuns soldiers sat as silently as they could trying to catch the first sight of Shahin and his men Warriors stood in their saddles shading their eyes to break the glare from the sunny plain It was a sound that first warned of Shahins coming the steady reverberation of galloping horses Alerted men strained to see their approaching companions A plume of dust rose from the valley floor driving fast in their direction New sounds reached the army garbled but piercing screams resounding metallic rings even an occasional shouted command Up Yamun yelled to the standardbearer The ninetailed banner rose over the gully A ragged shout spontaneously erupted from the line as men urged their horses forward The steeds scrambled up the bank tearing at the soft dirt with their hooves Hold shouted Yamun as the double line reached the edge of the trees still hidden from sight The standardbearer waved the banner from side to side The standards of the three tumens did the same The lines drew up and came to a halt Koja could hear the commanders of the jaguns shouting at their men to dress out their lines evening out the ranks Koja swallowed what tasted like a mouthful of dust He quickly recited sutras to Furo trying to remember any that told of success in battle With growing speed the dust cloud whirled toward Yamuns position Shapes formed out of the murk becoming wild horsemen who whipped furiously at their mounts The distant drone of hooves grew to a deep rolling thunder the cries and shouts became more distinct As the priest sat watching Shahin Khans golden banner flew past The riders continued down the valley following the narrow angle of the dry wash The dust of their passing roiled up and swept over Yamuns men in the tree line hiding them from sight Excellent shouted Yamun over the fading din Shahins men kicked up enough dust to cover us Keep the men back until the signals given The drumming hooves and whoops of the riders gradually died away though the dust still hung thick in the air Koja wrapped a scarf over his mouth and squeezed his eyes shut Around him he could hear men coughing and horses prancing with excitement The noise of Shahins men was replaced by sounds of the Khazari cavalrys galloping pursuit The dust clouds had barely opened up when another wave of riders burst out of the gloom The pounding hooves the jingling of metal and the shouts were all the same but the riders charging past were wearing the yellow and blue of Manass Koja nervously glanced down the line of warriors to his right a line that faded into the haze The mounted men were grimfaced hands tight on their reins They too watched the passing riders nervously waiting for the khahans signal The priest looked back to Yamun and saw him sitting grave and impassive only the slightest look of concern on his face Koja pulled the scarf from his mouth and leaned sideways to ask the khahan a question Then a different rumble fainter and lower in pitch added to the noise It was the deep boom of war drums rolling from the distance Yamun suddenly sat straight and raised his hand to the signalmen beside him Bows and drums the khahan commanded The aide next to the khahan quickly took his own bow and nocked a strange arrow with a carved bulbous head Instead of aiming at the enemy the man pointed the shaft upward as if he were shooting at the clouds The rank of signalmen prepared similar arrows At a slight nod from the khahan the archers shot their arrows skyward A chorus of howling shrieks pierced the din Koja startled yanked on the reins of his horse almost charging his mount into the chaotic fray Sechen seized the bridle and held the horse in Whistling arrows the big guard shouted nodding upward where the shafts still flew mournfully wailing over the galloping riders The whistling signal electrified the waiting troops Koja watched as each man eagerly pulled a bow from his case and with precision nocked one arrow while gripping a bundle of others in his hand The khahan dropped his hand Another flight of whistling arrows flew followed immediately by a loud twang like a badly tuned instrument as the ranks fired their bows The shafts hissed through the air stabbing into the gloom From the plain came a ragged chorus of startled cries Through small gaps in the swirling dust Koja saw a field dotted with a few dead and wounded Other horsemen milled in confusion panicked as they tried to find the source of the attack Before the enemy could recover Yamuns warriors shot again and again sending their arrows into the slowly lifting murk The cries of the wounded mixed with commands shouted in lilting Khazari that only Koja could understand Officers were desperately trying to regain control of the confused mass Men screamed of their injuries or called for their friends and horses The dust began to settle revealing a battlefield filled with confusion and fear Now before they recover charge the khahan ordered The ninetailed banner waved forward and the war drums were sounded Down the line Koja could see the three banners of the tumens take up the signal Three thousand men leaped from their positions Koja pulled back on his reins holding his horse from the rush The mare pranced and bucked champing to join the tide that rushed outward Even with Sechen holding the bit of Kojas horse it was hard to restrain the skittish steed Only after the ranks had swept past did Yamun move forward Steadily the khahan and those with him gained speed to keep up with the galloping warriors strung out in front of them Soon they were abreast of the stragglerslamed horses fallen riders hurriedly remounting and nags that couldnt keep up Koja clung to the pommel as he plunged forward straight for the thin wavering line of enemy riders For Koja the battle dissolved into a chaotic collection of scenes There was no sense of order or place It was not like the battles Koja had imagined organized proper almost stately Instead the charge was like opening the doorway to the realm of Li Pei the great judge of the underworld The first seconds of the attack were the clearest As the leading men of the Tuigan tore into the flank of the Khazari cavalry Koja could see the looks of utter astonishment and fear on the enemys faces The Khazari were still confounded by the torrent of Tuigan arrows and didnt seem to expect a charge The two armies met A sound like a peal of thunder tore through the milling crowd Koja had never experienced that instant when two lines met The shock of first impacthorses men lances and armor driving togetherstaggered him Almost instantly the two forces swirled into a mass The Tuigan rode straight into the enemy using their momentum to cut deep into the heart of their foes The Khazari wheeled in confusion and they lashed out in all directions Commanders shouted orders to their men desperately trying to regroup their units Before Koja could fully grasp the situation Yamun and his command were among the enemy An unshaven warrior with a gaunt face dressed in a dirty silk robe with gilt trim thrust a lance at the priest Instinctively Koja swung his mace up batting at the oncoming shaft The lance head ricocheted off the maces shaft and skittered past his arm bouncing off the metal plates of his armor As the man swept past a big fist shot out from the right cracking the Khazari on the chin The warrior toppled and thudded off the flank of Kojas mare Sechen pulled close to the lama and grinned holding up his fist in pride The priest twisted back horrified at what was happening The fallen Khazari was nowhere in sight he had vanished beneath the surging horses hooves After that Koja could no longer tell who was winning or even who was friend or foe His horse leaped over a mortally wounded stallion that flailed madly on its back Wild screams rattled around the terrified priest A warrior stood tottering His body was braced against the end of a broken lance which had been driven completely through his chest Another soldier swayed weakly in his saddle clutching the bloody stump of his wrist His eyes were glazed and almost rolled completely back He babbled prayers to some god Two troopers grappled with a third trying to throw him from his saddle Abruptly the fighting seemed to stop The charge had carried Yamuns men through the enemy The effect was dramatic The sudden appearance of the warriors had set the Khazari cavalry into panicked flight The broken lines streamed back the way they had come ignoring their officers leaving their wounded behind Signal the pursuit Yamun bellowed to the standardbearer Already the commanders of the jaguns were gathering their men The standard waved and the war drums quickly picked up the signal Not allowing the Khazari troops a moment to regroup Yamun hurled his riders after them The lines of Tuigan cavalry quickly fanned out A rider wearing the armor of a Tuigan dayguard furiously whipped his horse overtaking Koja Some headstrong young warrior out to impress his khahan the lama thought He looked to see who it was on the faint chance he knew the man To his amazement it was the dayguard he had seen earlier the man who had aroused his suspicion Hard behind the man came Afrasib the wizard He held no weapon but a slender bone wand A flashing spark shot from the end then a sudden gout of flame exploded far to the right A wavering line of smoke hung for a second in the air The wizard laughed aloud deriving some maniacal pleasure from the destruction Suddenly Yamuns group ran into another cluster Khazari men who had no intention of turning their horses and running There must have been twelve or more of them grouped under a commander Sechens momentum carried him through the defenders His charge scattered the group Some of the Khazari lancers veered off toward Yamuns standardbearer forcing the man away from the khahan Two charged toward Koja only to be met by the priests guards The suspiciouslooking dayguard continued to whip his horse mercilessly driving it toward the khahan Koja wanted to call the man back then realized the guards job was to protect the khahan not him Koja saw the dayguard his foxlike face gloating move close behind Yamun The priest assumed the fellow was only coming to the support of his ruler but he suddenly lunged forward thrusting his lance into Yamuns back The khahan howled in rage and pain Twisting in his saddle he swung his saber in a blurring backhand swing There was a brief dull sound as Yamuns blade sheered through the mans collarbone and cut into his chest The wouldbe assassin dropped his lance in surprise Blood flowed freely from the rent in his armor He fumblingly drew his sword and weakly jabbed at the khahan The thrust missed but pierced Yamuns white mare in the rump At the same time the Khazari lunged forward sensing an opportunity to strike Yamuns mare squealed in pain from the dayguards blow and lurched forward crashing through the two enemy riders One mans horse staggered knocked sideways by the charging mare The rider clutched at the mane to keep his balance forgetting his attack He quickly lost his balance and fell to the ground Still acting with fearful speed Yamun recovered from his backswing and thrust his sword forward sweeping the point up The tip of his saber slid under the bottom of the other Khazaris breastplate With a quick twist and pull Yamun gutted the trooper The mans eyes widened in surprise and pain his hand automatically reaching to his belly The lance dropped from his dead fingers and his body slowly fell forward The khahans sword still halfentangled in the body was twisted from his grasp The khahan suddenly sagged back in his saddle too exhausted to recover his weapon Dark red blood his blood soaked the back of his armor and stained the silver fittings of his saddle Koja realized there was no one else around to aid Yamun Instinctively Koja jammed his heels into the belly of his horse driving it forward The dayguard assassin clinging to his saddle was about to strike the defenseless Yamun from the rear Urgency drove Koja to form a mystic shield of deflection around the khahan With one hand wrapped in the reins and his legs clamped around the chest of his mount the priest tried to trace the arcane symbols in the air and chant the necessary sutras Only the grace of Furo could save Yamun now The assassins sword lunged straight and true for Yamuns neck just as Kojas spell was completed An unseen force seized the khahan and moved him away from the attack It was not enough The tip of the assassins blade struck Yamuns shoulder splintering through the armor and drawing new blood The swing pulled the assassin forward toward the khahan Just as the man reached the limit of his lunge Yamun reached out and grabbed the assassins arm Fiercely the old warrior yanked dragging the treacherous dayguard off his saddle A longbladed dagger appeared in Yamuns other hand Without letting go he punched the blade into the killers side The man gave out a horrible inhuman scream then writhed and twisted in the khahans grip Even injured the warlord refused to let go At that instant the dismounted Khazari ran forward his blade swung high Yamun saw it coming out of the corner of his eye An agonized grunt escaped his lips as he heaved the squirming assassin still spitted on his dagger into the air The body crashed headfirst into the Khazari and the two of them slammed to the ground A thunderous yet screeching roar reeled Kojas senses Waves of sound hammered at his eardrums Just in front of him Yamun clutched at his skull rocking in agony The khahan crumpled and fell off his horse hitting the ground like a slab of meat Tears of pain welled up in the holy mans eyes blocking his vision The howling scream ended as quickly as it had started Gasping against the pain Koja clutched at his horses mane and wiped the tears from his eyes Looking back the priest saw Afrasib a look of smug victory on his face As the wizard rode forward he pointed the bone rod the wand of fire at Yamuns motionless body Koja could see the wizards thin shoulders heave with laughter even though all sound was blocked by the roaring pain in the priests ears Koja knew he must do something for the protection hed already cast on Yamun was useless against the wizards magical attack Fortunately Afrasib seemed to pay the lama no mind Desperately Koja looked around for someone to come to the khahans aid The Tuigan attack had done its job too well Yamuns troopers were caught up in chasing the fleeing enemy Ahead the lama could see the big form of Sechen but the man was too far away to do any good now Koja thought of the spells he knew He needed one that would stop Afrasib completely not just hurt him So long as the wizard was alive and able to move he was dangerous The only chance Koja realized was to freeze the wizard in place The lama fumbled through the small bag hanging from the pommel of his saddle searching for the right ingredient to work the spell Under his breath he mumbled praises to Furo and the Enlightened One Now more than ever he needed their assistance Quickly Kojas fingers closed on the small iron ball he needed for the spell Tearing his hand from the sack the lama flung the pellet at Afrasib while shouting out the words of the spell Still unable to hear Koja could only assume that he said the words correctly Instinctively Afrasib recoiled from Kojas throw His body rocked back in the saddle and as the iron ball struck froze in an oddly tilted poseone arm upraised to ward off the pellet and his body arched backward His face was twisted with surprise and anger The wizard stayed in the saddle for just a moment and then tipped sideways body still locked in his comical pose Afrasib hit the ground still stiff and unbending Koja collapsed against his mares neck breathing the sweet saltiness of its sweat in relief Then he remembered Yamun Awkwardly the lama slid off his horse and stumblingly ran to where the khahan lay faceup in the dust Before examining the body Koja was certain that Yamun was dead Then unexpectedly Yamuns eyes fluttered Koja stopped disbelieving Quickly he rolled Yamun over to examine his wounds One sword stroke had laid open the back of the khahans left shoulder Blood still flowed from it soaking into the khahans armor Using a dagger the priest slashed away the leather straps of the armor peeling away the heavy shirt The floppy sleeves of his own oversized suit of armor got in the way Frustrated he hurriedly struggled out of the heavy scale mail Tearing away a piece of his own robe Koja packed the cloth against Yamuns wound and continued his examination Farther down Yamuns back was a hole where the lance had struck Again Koja hacked with his knife to see the wound It was small compared to the cut on the shoulder but it had driven deeper Blood and bile seeped out of it The edges were purple and swollen Koja pressed at the wound gently Yellowgreen pus oozed out under his fingertips Poison he said aloud Koja went back to his examination then suddenly realized that he could hear The knowledge reminded him where he was and fearfully he looked around in case an enemy was creeping up on him There were no Khazari nearby but Koja saw Sechen and the standardbearer headed his way Over here he shouted as he leaped to his feet Here Yamun is here His words had an electrifying effect as the two Tuigan whipped their exhausted horses into motion Sechen didnt even bother to slow down as he approached The big warrior leaped from his saddle sword drawn Back Khazari demon Sechen snarled as he sprang forward pushing the little priest away Youll die for this He is dying Look at them Look at the wizard Koja shouted in frustrated anger He pointed at Afrasibs frozen form I might keep him alive Just let me work At that moment the standardbearer shouted Sechen come here Look at this He was standing where the dayguard assassin and the Khazari had fallen The trooper was underneath apparently killed by the fall The dayguard lay sprawled facedown on top of him Look said the man With the toe of his boot he gingerly rolled the dayguard over Sechen sucked in his breath in surprise The man that lay there was not a man at all His face had been replaced by that of a large fox The soft brown fur of its muzzle was thick with blood Its hands were long slender paws but with human fingers not like an animals By mighty Furo Koja breathed looking up from Yamuns aide Thats a hu hsien Whats that Sechen demanded An evil spirit Koja answered hastily It attacked the khahan Now let me help The Tuigan warriors looked at each other each hoping the other had an answer Very well Sechen decided but if he dies you die He squatted near the lama to watch his every move Koja quickly set to work Get the bag off my horse he ordered The standardbearer hurriedly fetched the bag passing it to Sechen The first problem was the poison Taking an herb from his bag the lama pressed his hands on the lance wound and uttered a prayer There was a heat beneath his palms as the spell began to take effect The khahans been poisoned I cannot stop the venom right now but I have slowed the poison to keep it from killing him out here This may give me time to pray for a cure Koja carefully explained everything he did to defuse Sechens suspicions That finished he examined the wounds again They were bad but probably not serious enough to kill the khahan Still if Furo allowed it was best to heal them now Bowing his head in prayer the priest counted out a rosary on his beads When he completed the plea to Furo Kojas hands itched and trembled with the power coursing in them Gently he placed a palm on each wound then pressed them down firmly Yamun stirred and groaned under the pain Blood seeped through the lamas fingers The heat once again grew under Kojas hands this time stronger and lasting longer Sechen sucked in his breath through his teeth Look His wounds are closing he whispered Pinkishwhite skin grew before Sechens eyes knitting the wounds shut and leaving only a slight scar At last Koja took a deep breath of relief and took his hands away He tore off another shred of his robe spit into it and daubed away the blood and fluid to check his handiwork Koja watched the khahans chest rise and fall until he was satisfied the man slept quietly The khahan is better Koja explained as he sat back in the dirt shaking from exhaustion However the poison is still in him and he could still die Can you take him back to camp Sechen nodded He looked at the priest in wonder Are you sure What about the battle the lama asked You saw This battle is over We won Prince Jad and Goyuk Khan will finish things here Gently Sechen lifted the khahan in his arms Then get him to his tent He needs rest Koja urged By your word it shall be done answered Sechen But you will come with me Sechen nodded to the standardbearer He will tell the prince what has happened Koja struggled to his feet and helped Sechen hoist the khahan into his saddle Yamun barely opened his eyes Oh yes Koja said the wizard Afrasib lies over there He helped the hu hsien and would have killed Yamun Right now he cannot move but he will recover soon You might want to do something about him The standardbearer looked at the oddly frozen figure on the battlefield and grinned unpleasantly Before Koja could stop the man the trooper ran over and neatly slit the spellcasters throat Ive always wanted to do that to one of Bayaluns lackeys he coldly proclaimed As Koja sat stunned with horror the standardbearer mounted his horse and galloped away to inform Prince Jad of the khahans condition He should have kept the wizard alive to question him Koja shouted Priest the wizard got what all Bayaluns kind deserve Just consider yourself lucky not to be among them Sechen grimly explained as he led their horses back to camp That night there was a council in Yamuns tent Outside the finest and most trusted of the nightguards ringed the yurt Each was dressed in full armor and heavily armed They were nervous and jumpy Already several rabbits had died from rapidly fired arrows when they made a little noise in the bushes The guards eyed each other as well The rumors were already circulating through the campstories of treachery among Yamuns bodyguards whole cadres of wizards and evil monsters rising out of the ground Those inside the yurt were no less tense The spacious tent was almost completely dark A small iron pot of glowing red coals provided the only illumination barely lighting the grim faces of the men present Yamun lay on his bed conscious but very weak There was very little color in his face Under Kojas supervision he was covered with several layers of heavy felt blankets Perspiration beaded on Yamuns brow as the priest tried to sweat the poison out of the khahans system Sitting on the rugs at the side of Yamuns bed were Jad and Goyuk little more than dark shapes in the darker yurt Koja had spent the last hour carefully telling his version of the days events Jad sat with his head bowed to the floor Goyuk nodded as he considered the priests words Koja now finished describing how he had treated the khahans wounds sat silently with his hands on his knees waiting for the others to speak It is good to have gods on your side even if they are the gods of strangers Goyuk said in a rambling tone It was very late and the day had been long Fatigue was showing on the old khans face his eyes drooped and he slumped as if he were some exhausted vulture From his bed Yamun sighed and focused on the big guard at the back of the yurt Sechen did it happen as the lama said The guard shambled forward nodding What I saw is as the priest said Khahan the wrestler answered stiffly bowing I remember the guard attacking and the wound Yamun added He pushed himself up onto one elbow Historian you saved my life Therefore Koja of the Khazari I ask you to be my anda Yamun weakly extended a hand to the priest There was a gasp from the group Great Lord II am not worthy of this Koja stammered his face reddening with embarrassment Thats not for you to say I choose who will be my anda Yamun pushed his shaking hand out toward Koja Father protested Jad You are weak and need rest Think on this later Yamun growled Be silent my son Koja saved my life and that has earned him the right Yes Khahan Jad replied cowed Yamun looked toward Goyuk to see if he had any objections The old khan only sucked on his gums keeping his counsel to himself The khahan shifted his gaze back to the lama Well priest Koja took a breath to steady himself I cannot argue with your wishes I am greatly honored I accept He took the khahans hand Then we are anda From this day you are Koja little brother of Yamun He gave the priests hand a weak squeeze and then dropped his arm From now on you must call me Yamun Koja looked at the others Goyuk was unreadable his old lined face barely betraying any emotions Sechen looked stern as always but there was a glimmer of respect in his eyes The princes brow was furrowed with concern and he avoided the gaze of the priest Koja was not sure if he was upset or merely confused The men have fought well today Yamun continued weakly Jad report on the battle He closed his eyes and let a ragged breath escape his lungs The prince roused himself putting whatever thoughts he had to the back of his mind Father your plan succeeded The foot soldiers followed the riders into the trap and Goyuk and I were able to surround them The khans have taken many prisoners Jad bowed slightly toward his father who was not watching What of losses Shahins men whispered the stricken khahan Goyuk and I lost few men The foot soldiers couldnt catch us and we simply shot arrows at them until they surrendered Your men did not fare badly though they lost more because they were involved in the heaviest fighting Shahins tumen has lost many brave warriors Great Lord More than half of his men are killed or wounded The youth waited for some word from his father Not too bad Yamun commented with a sigh Give the prisoners the choice of service or death Those that join us are assigned to Shahins command He coughed a little and then wheezed out the rest What about Manass The governor He was cowardly and did not come out Father Our messengers have already delivered the heads of his generals I thought you would want this done Jad answered sliding closer to the bed He sends back messages of peace and friendship Manass will be ours And soon all of Khazari added Goyuk glancing at Koja to see how the priest reacted Indeed all of Khazari agreed Yamun Were the assassins from Manass Jad asked It makes sense Goyuk concurred No it doesnt Yamun disagreed with a weak sigh The two khans looked at him in surprise Why would the governor send his army if he had assassins Besides Afrasib is one of Bayaluns people The khahan let the point sink in for a moment while he recovered his strength What was this creature called the one that attacked me A hu hsien Khahan Koja explained as he fixed Yamuns covers They are evil spirits who often do men harm I heard tales of them at my temple They appear as foxes normally but can disguise themselves as people It is said the emperor of Shou Lung uses them as spies because they can change their shape It could have been this emperor Jad offered The emperor of Shou Yamun mused Perhaps You have many enemies Yamun Goyuk pointed out Why would this emperor attack you now Why indeed Yamun slowly pulled one arm out from under the sheets and began to stroke his chin Perhaps he fears me Perhaps he knows that I can conquer his land Yamuns eyes glazed slightly Koja quickly wiped the khahans sweaty brow with a warm cloth Yamun closed his eyes and then spoke again So one of Bayaluns wizards was involved Koja nodded Yes KhahanerYamun You shouldnt have let them die Jad pointed out We could have made him talk Your fathers guards were most incensed and did not heed my suggestions Koja answered defensively Still they should not have died Jad snapped his jaw stubbornly set Perhaps wed now know who was responsible for the attack on the khahan Do you have their bodies the priest suddenly asked turning to Jad and Goyuk The prince was taken aback by the lamas question Yes Yes we do he answered flustered Perhaps you can have your answer Koja offered mysteriously See that their bodies are not burned If mighty Furo is willing I will speak to them Confused the prince looked into the gloom at the priest Afrasib is Bayaluns man Then shes suspect unless the wizard acted on his own Bayalun The emperor of Shou Perhaps one perhaps none the khahan murmured feebly from his bed I do have many enemies Yamun paused his strength temporarily exhausted The others sat silently considering his words How long can I be dead the khahan asked suddenly What Jad blurted out I want everyone to think Im dead How long can you keep the army together Yamun turned toward Jad The prince thought for a little bit Without you two maybe three days There are already rumors I say four or five days The men are good men They listen to your son contradicted Goyuk punctuating his comment by sucking on his lip Jad youll keep them together as long as you must No one must know whats happened me Yamun said in the best commanding tone his weak voice could manage But why Koja asked Dont you want to reassure your men SomeoneBayalun the Shou emperor or someone elsewants me dead Theyre sure to have more plans in mind If Im dead theyll reveal themselves by their actions Yamun explained as if he were talking to a child His speech was stopped by a fit of coughing Jad and Goyuk looked away politely ignoring the khahans weakness The priest helped Yamun sit up to clear his throat You need rest Yamun still wheezing tried to wave Koja off but the priest refused to take his seat He pulled the blankets up to wrap them over the khahans shoulders You need rest now unless you want to die Yamun was wracked by another fit of coughing All right he gasped out Go to your tents all of you Jad Im depending on you Listen to Goyuk and the priest Now leave me He sank back onto the cushions breathing noisily between the intermittent coughing fits Jad and Goyuk exchanged worried glances and then bowed to the floor Silently the two took their leave As they went out the door Koja took a blanket from a pile at the foot of Yamuns bed and wrapped himself up in it He curled up on the floor beside the Illustrious Emperor of All People and tried to make himself as comfortable as possible Tonight he would stay in Yamuns yurt to watch over his patienthis anda Dead Voices The only glow that lit the darkness came from a rough crystal the size of a large egg nested on a tripod of wrought iron The stands small legs ended in finely chiselled rams heads covered in gilt Small facetted garnets decorated the curling horns of the beasts tapering back into the black iron of the supports The crystal shown dimly with the warm colors of sunlight Chanar marveled at it Staring into the stone was like looking out on a sunny morning through a small hole in the tent wall Warmth and light danced in front of his eyes just beyond his reach When he stared into the stone closely he thought he saw shapes flicker and fade deep in its heart He wondered what Bayalun sitting across from him saw as she hunched over the orb The khadun chanted Her nose was practically pressed against the crystal and her hands were carefully cupped around the base of the tripod Chanar squirmed His legs were going to sleep but he didnt want to move for fear of disturbing Bayalun She had been sitting in the same position for the last halfhour repeating the same chant over and over again Chanar wondered how she managed it The chant was mindnumbing At first he thought it was Tuigan badly distorted but that quickly proved to be wrong Whatever she was saying it was in no language Chanar had ever heard The general was sure of that Hed had thirty minutes to listen and be certain Abruptly Mother Bayalun ended the chant with a huffing sigh of exhaustion She sat up straight arching her back and rubbed her temples hard with her fingertips The crystal still glowed between them Look she commanded as she lightly touched the stone The stones glow shimmered and then expanded filling the air between them Bayalun spread her hands open and the light spread too A scene formed and grew within the light It was a yurt in the bright morning sun Guards stood rigidly outside ringing it A tall standard set near the doorway flapped in the breeze Thats Yamuns yurt Chanar exclaimed Mother Bayalun laughed General Chanar you are so charming she said Yes that is the khahans tent She stood up leaning heavily on her staff and stiffly walked to his side Look she commanded again Chanar peered closely at the scene Theres old Goyuk and Jad he whispered pointing at the image There is no need to be quiet Bayalun croaked out She stopped to clear her throat They cannot hear us Chanar nodded still watching the scene He stepped back to give the image space The general wasnt about to let it touch him Look Bayalun suddenly hissed Look at the banner Its just as they said She pointed at the pole standing in front of the yurt From it gently swinging in the breeze they couldnt feel were nine black yak tails The sign of death Chanar said softly He stared for a time at the slowly waving tails Yamuns dead He turned to Mother Bayalun not really accepting what he saw Of course she assured him confidently Why else would they fly the banner Chanar bit back the desire to scold Bayalun for her callous words The dead deserved respect I want to see Yamuns body he suddenly demanded His green silk robe glittered and shone in the light from the crystal The sorceress shook her head The hood fell from her face allowing her rich gray and black hair to hang free It cannot be done There are protections on the royal yurt placed there by Burekaimy husband The crystal cannot see inside it Then how do you know hes dead Chanar countered He eyed the image suspiciously Because he must be They would not fly the banner if he was not dead Bayaluns face showed her absolute conviction The general considered her reasoning pulling at his knuckles while he stood there Chanar agreed after a moment But why dont they keep his death a secret Without the khahan the army will fall apart The men must already know Bayalun offered as she circled the glowing image Otherwise you are right Goyuk and Jad would keep the death a secret Chanar nodded agreeing with her conclusions That would be Goyuks wayuntil he could get Jad safely in control of the khans Bayalun looked at Chanar through the image Of course we will dash any plans Goyuk has formulated Chanar smiled cruelly and then watched the scene absorbed in his own thoughts Figures came and wentJad Goyuk Sechen and Koja As the baldheaded lama stepped out of the royal yurt Chanar spit on the floor in disgust That one dies he snarled jabbing a finger at the priest Bayalun snorted to herself As you wish She had no intention of giving the priest to Chanar just to satisfy his pride The lama might be useful After all he was an emissary of the Khazari and an avenue to the Red Mountain Temple If nothing else she would keep the lama just to remind Chanar of her power However for now she was not going to tell him of her plans Before you can execute anyone Chanar you must be khahan We still have that to do she reminded him in regal tones Chanar grunted in irritation Well what now First we wait while the army bickers and grows restless Those two cannot hold the army together for long Bayalun pointed toward the khahans tent Goyuk and Jad stood outside it Then you will arrive and give them order What if Jad keeps the army together Hes Yamuns blood after all Chanar pointed out as he stepped closer to Bayalun Then we will deal with him too The army has khans who will listen to you It will just take a word here and there to keep them unhappy She smiled reassuringly With my magic you can appear to them in a dream Chanar frowned at her suggestion This he thought was not the proper way to become the khahanusing dark arts to sway the minds of warriors Why dont I just go there and speak for myself Dont be in such a hurry Let the young prince stumble and fall Bayalun stepped into the image Koja and the others swirled like ghosts around her She bent over slowly supporting herself with her goldtopped staff With one long sharp finger she tapped the crystal and muttered a word under her breath The image suddenly withered away Strike a light she ordered While Chanar blew on the small pile of coals that smoldered in a metal bowl she carefully lifted the crystal off the tripod and wrapped it in a leather bag General you must be ready to leave at any time Timing is everything in this Too early and the khans will suspect you Too late and Jad will have rallied the ordus to his banner Either way you will lose your chance She looked up from her work and stared sharply at him The men will serve under you will they not They love me he answered They trust me You had better be right The khadun crossed the tent and undid the door flap a clear signal for Chanar to leave He bowed slightly to her and stepped out through the door After Chanar left Bayalun sealed the tent flap and knelt down near the brazier After taking one last look around she was satisfied that she was alone Quickly the sorceress whispered a few mystic words and sprinkled a handful of incense into the coals The powder burned quickly billowing into a heady puff of white smoke The smoke rose twisting and massing Gradually it formed into a face a man of Shou features handsome with steady dark eyes Greetings to the khadun of the Tuigan people said the face in a whispery hollow voice The words were spoken in perfect Tuigan though colored with a distinct Shou accent Greetings to the Minister of State Bayalun replied May he live forever The face smiled the smoke drifting away at the corners of the mouth All is well it asked puffs of smoke swirling from its mouth with each word The khahan has been struck down Bayalun answered gloatingly It happened in battle Soon there will be a new khahan She tapped the floor decisively with her staff None suspect our involvement the form asked in soft words Do not worry mandarin No one knows your empire sent an assassin Bayalun mocked the mandarins fearful caution The smoky face ignored her tone It is sad for your people Surely none chosen as the new khahan can hope to match the illustrious glory of Yamun Khahan The new khahan will need many advisors and learned men to help him through these difficult times The face was growing indistinct as smoke trailed from its nostrils and ears And of course Shou Lung will offer them Bayalun noted Remember too the new khahan will also need friendly helpful neighborsand assurances of their goodwill We have already decided the gifts that will be sent Khadun the minister said sternly Are you trying to renegotiate Many of your people would be angry if they learned what you have done Bayaluns face purpled slightly They might blame Shou Lung instead she snapped back A khahan any khahan is dangerous to you if all the tribes follow him alone This is true Then we understand each other perfectly the face said faintly Now it is time for me The last words trailed off into silence and the smoky face became nothing but a shapeless mass Standing Bayalun waved her staff through the vapors to break up the cloud There was no particular reason for it but she felt powerful doing it Moving stiffly her arthritis flaring up again she crossed the tent and undid the door flap to let in the cool morning air A beam of sunlight illuminated the room With little else to do but wait she sat in its pleasant warmth and rested Today has been a good day she reflected Everything seemed to be working as she had planned There was only one minor concern Neither the hu hsien nor her wizard had reported Afrasib had strict orders to keep her informed It wasnt like him to forget her commands He was normally so diligent and attentive Still Afrasibs failure was only a minor problem Most likely the wizard had not had a chance to contact her with his spells Besides all that really mattered was that Yamun her stepson was dead Now the khadun had to place Chanar on the throne before any rivals could challenge him Once Chanar was khahan she would rule the Tuigan through him In Yamuns tent the three conspirators Koja Jad and Goyuk hovered around the khahans sickbed The warlord was barely awake His face was pale gray tinged with a hint of blue His breath came in labored sighs wheezing in and out A damp film of perspiration trickled across his shaven tonsure His braids which normally hung from his temples were undone spilling the graying red hair over his embroidered pillow His eyelids wavered between almost closed and not quite open Jad pulled the priest aside away from Yamuns hearing You said he would get better the prince whispered There was a touch of danger in Jads words perhaps fueled by desperation Koja swallowed nervously He has lived through the night Lord Jadaran That was the first struggle Then why hasnt he gotten better Jad demanded pressing the priest back toward the wall II dont know Koja feebly protested He suppressed a tremor that started to come over him brought on by fear and exhaustion For two days the priest had slept no more than an hour Judging from Jads appearanceholloweyed and haggardthe prince had rested no better You dont know Jad snapped in frustration slamming his fist into the carpeted wall beside Koja What do you know Lord Jadaran Koja said firmly his patience gone I am no expert in poisons I have closed the khahans wounds and lessened the poisons fire I did what I could thank the almighty Furo There is nothing more I can do His life rests on the scales of Li Pei Li Pei Goyuk asked just catching the end of the conversation The Strict Judge the master of the dead who weighs the karma of men This no sound good Goyuk commented shaking his head So you say theres nothing you can do priest Jad asked slowly realizing that events were out of their control There is nothing I can do for the khahan Koja said carefully but there is still something I can do Whats that old Goyuk asked Speak with the dead It is difficult and maybe a little dangerous Koja explained but Furo has blessed me with this ability Wonderful You propose to wait for my father to die and then talk to him Jad growled He spun away from the priest and strode to the khahans sickbed Not the khahan Koja followed after Jad trying to explain I meant A sigh suddenly escaped from Yamuns lips and his eyes fluttered A plan the khahan breathed out softly Weakly looking toward the others he tried to speak again only to falter and fall back upon his pillow Koja wasted no time with more speech Quickly he pulled back the covers and listened to the khahans chest His heart was still beating and his breathing was slightly stronger Still his color was pale bluegray and his sweat was cold The priest squeezed at the khahans tough and weatherbeaten hands checking the firmness of the muscles The lama waved to a servant to bring a pot of simmering herbs It was placed carefully at his side along with a colorful strip of woven cloth The lama dipped the cloth in the pot and gingerly lifted the steaming fabric out holding it up to cool Finally Koja laid the herbinfused cloth across Yamuns chest folding it back and forth several times With shaking fingers the priest pressed it into position and then carefully covered the khahan once again with the blankets The lama finally got up from his examination He heard us It is a sign he is getting better Jads face broke into a shaky smile of relief But only a little better cautioned Koja But what is this plan lama Goyuk asked breaking the tension Thankful for the excuse to change the subject Koja hurriedly launched into an explanation Khans Furo has seen fit to answer my prayers and grant me the power to speak with the dead Not with the illustrious khahan he hastily added but to talk to one of his assassins What good is this Jad asked looking away from his father Koja shook his head I may learn something about the poison used on the khahan You may learn who is to blame for the attack I know who is to blamedidnt you yourself say the creature was an agent of the Shou And didnt you say the governor of Manass had a Shou advisor at his side What more is there to know Jad said dismissing Kojas last suggestion with a wave There was Afrasib too Goyuk pointed out How does he fit in He was a wizard Jad snapped as if that explained it all The khahan he would find out Try what the lama say Goyuk urged Jad took a deep breath He was young and unused to making such important decisions Goyuk he said slowly because you advise this Ill try the priests ideas He pivoted to face Koja What do we do Have the bodies brought to the tent and we will perform the rite to summon their spirits Then you can ask your questions through me You mean to bring the bodies here to the royal yurt I wont allow it Jad said defiantly his young eyes flashing Since my father is stricken Im in command The dead bodies will pollute the yurt That cannot be allowed But I must have the bodies I must touch them protested Koja Jad mulled over the lamas words Very well but it must be done in secret and it cannot be done here The prince got to his feet and paced back and forth as he gave his commands Goyuk have one of the nightguardsnot the dayguardsgo to Sechen the Wrestlers yurt and order him to come with us Issue a proclamation all khans are to assemble their men this evening for a review by their prince That will keep the curious occupied and out of our way By your will it shall be done Goyuk declared as he left Thank you wise counsellor Jad replied as the tent flap fell closed Exhausted the son turned back to his father Spotting Koja Jad stopped And you priest go and get yourself ready Koja bowed and then left There was little he needed to prepare but he obeyed all the same Yamun would manage without his care for a little while As he walked back to his yurt Koja could feel the gloom that had settled on the camp The warriors were tense uncertain of the future Back in his tent Koja quickly gathered the few things he would need Hodj prepared him a hot meal the priests first in days The food revived Koja bringing him back from the edge of exhaustion The meal finished the priest opened his scrolls and once more reviewed the sutras he needed to know for the upcoming rite He was still reading when Sechen brought horses Packing up a small pouch Koja joined the others They rode silently across yesterdays battlefield Most of the dead men were gone taken by relatives or friends to be properly buried A few still lay where they had fallen their bodies looted Still the battlefield was far from clean Littering the field were the bodies of horses Nearly all the dead animals had been left to rot The victors had taken what saddles bridles and tack they could carry but the carcasses were left undisturbed Only a few horses had been butchered for their meat Most were puffy and bloated after many hours in the sun Vermin were feasting on the carcasses Vultures squawked at the riders as they went by Jackals yipped when the men ventured too close Jad worried that they were being watched as the group rode along The prince had forgone his fine white stallion with the black and red saddle for a plain black mare and a saddle borrowed from one of the dayguards He did not want to attract undue attention Several of the dayguards had asked to ride along since the prince was almost certain to be their new khahan but he had firmly refused them Ahead of the prince Koja too rode quietly thinking of what was to come He was worried When hed made the offer to summon up the spirits of the assassins he hadnt considered the possible results What if he were wrong and the assassins were paid by Prince Ogandi The farther they rode the less confident Koja became Down there said Sechen interrupting the thoughts of both men We hid the bodies down there He pointed to a small overhang that projected from the other side of the gully That way there would be no questions Good Jad said You have served my father well He will see that you are rewarded To serve him is my only reward answered the wrestler Koja had no doubts the man meant every word Stopping at the edge of the gully the group dismounted in the shade of the trees Sechen hobbled the princes stallion so it could not wander The rest slipped off the bits and bridles so the mares could graze comfortably The mares would naturally stay near Jads stallion so there was no need to hobble them Leaving their mounts the men slid and stumbled down the bank to where the bodies were hidden If the battlefield hadnt already stank of death they would have smelled the bodies some distance away With so much death around the smell of the corpses was only a minor thing The heat of the day had not been kind to the dead Drawn by the decay flies buzzed thickly around the small shelf where the bodies were tucked Sechen reached in brushing the cloud of insects away and pulled the corpses out The bodies had already started to rot and something had been gnawing at them A noxious poisonous wind exhaled from their inner cavities as the two corpses came tumbling out of the crack They flopped and rolled down the slope until they jammed up on a small pile of rocks Koja felt a quick squeeze of queasiness and resolutely choked it back This was all his idea he couldnt be sick now Goyuk and Jad stepped back well away from the bloated remains Sechen quickly hurried away as soon as his job was done Koja was not as fortunate as the others for the spell he meant to cast required him to touch the bodies However he was slightly prepared He pulled a spiceinfused cloth and pressed it over his face The heady smell made him dizzy but at least now his nostrils werent filled with the odor of rotten flesh Get started Jad said impatiently The priest thrust a small stick of incense into the ground then waved to Sechen Reluctantly the tall fellow shambled over with a small metal cage hung from a chain In it glowed a hot ember Taking the chain Koja picked out the ember with silver tongs and touched it to the incense Within seconds a thin stream of sweetly scented smoke rose up from the little stick As the incense filled the air around him Koja settled back and began chanting sutras He had never used these prayers before but knew they were the words needed to summon back spirits The others watched him silently Still suspicious of the priest Jad signaled to Sechen making like he was drawing a bow The wrestler nodded in understanding Quietly he took up his bow and held it ready just in case the priest attempted to cast a spell on the prince Everyone waited nervously for Koja to finish his chant It seemed that the priest droned on forever The words were hypnotic seductive Koja was oblivious to the strange sound of his chant All his concentration was spent in uttering the words Furo poured into his mind Simply saying the chant required an effort that cramped the muscles of his face His upper lip trembled and the back of his neck tingled He could sense forces swirling about him called by the musical quality of the words His vision narrowed to a single point Then abruptly the words stopped Koja leaned forward and touched the cold blue forehead of the dead wizard A pale red light swelled out of the late Afrasibs slack mouth winding slowly around the dead wizards face Gradually the orb rose trailing tendrils of light that continued to play over the cold face As the orb moved it elongated and increased in size Koja sat back in surprise Summoning up dead spirits was new to him he had no idea what to expect No one at the Red Mountain Temple ever mentioned a glowing light like this As he watched the light shimmered and expanded slowly forming into somethinga wispy transparent form of Afrasib The spirit opened its eyes black voids and stared directly at Koja The lama shuddered as he looked into the dark pits The priest spoke over his shoulder to the others behind him The spirit is bound here for a short time Koja whispered afraid he might disturb the thing that hovered over Afrasibs body Quickly what are your questions I can only ask a few so choose them carefully Ask who it worked for Jad hissed sitting stiffly upright concealing his fear Koja turned back to the spirit Who ordered you to kill Yamun The one who wanted it done the spirit answered Its voice came from midair somewhere in the vicinity of its former mouth It was Afrasibs voice but cold and monotone Ask the name urged the prince What is the name of the person who ordered this killing JuHai Chou The words drifted softly throughout the gully Who is JuHai Chou Jad wondered aloud No dont ask that Ask about Bayalun Did Eke Bayalun know of the attack The spirit languorously replied Mother Bayalun knows many things Would she not know this Now the spirit questions us the prince muttered in disgust I cannot hold him much longer Prince Jadaran cautioned the lama Sweat had broken out on his brow and the strain of keeping the spirit bound was telling on him Who is JuHai Chou Goyuk broke in taking up Jads previous question This may tell us more Who is JuHai Chou the one who ordered you to kill Yamun Koja strained to keep the spirit from slipping away The light wavered and dimmed then returned The hu hsien the voice echoed faintly The image started to dwindle What was his plan Quickly priest ask Jad shouted sensing that the contact was fading Afrasib what was JuHai Chous reason Koja blurted out He was sent to help the spirit intoned Who sent him Koja quickly asked before the spirit could fade The Minister of State was Afrasibs cryptic reply Who was JuHai Chou help Koja didnt finish the question The light had shrunk in on itself leaving only a small point that hung in the air for a few more seconds and then disappeared completely The priest slid back from the dead bodies thankful to Furo that it was over I am sorry The spirit escaped me It was very strong He pulled off the scented cloth and bowed to the prince in apology Jad grunted sounding a little like his father What about the other We can learn more from him Koja rubbed his shaven head and looked at the body of the foxman The gaping gash that shattered the creatures chest was black and thick with flies I do not think it will work He is not a man His spirit is not the same Then weve learned nothing Yamuns son said in disgust brushing the dust from his kalat as he stood We have a nameJuHai Chou the priest pointed out He was relieved that no names from Khazari had come up And we have a mandarins title Goyuk added Big herds grow from small sheep Perhaps Jad conceded as he climbed back up the bank Still I dont see anything useful in it The rest of the group got up and followed They rode back to the khahans camp with little conversation The midday sun beat heavily on the corpses covering the battlefield The stench grew stronger Koja never before realized that war left behind such death and decay He knew that some men died in the battle and others often suffered hideous wounds but the aftermath was always something forgotten ignored Nobody ever told of the horses screams or the bloated bodies of the unburied that covered the ground The group reached the camp without any interruption detouring only a few times to avoid some packs of jackals that refused to flee from their approach As they wound their way back through the warriors tents the men came out to greet them The troopers stood quietly with their heads downcast as the prince passed At first the men seemed mournful for the loss of Jads father their khahan Watching them line the way the priest could sense an uneasiness among the men The mourners fixed their gaze on Jad as if waiting for him to do something From the back of the crowd a man suddenly broke into an anguished chant improvising a lament to the fallen khahan The winds of heaven are not balanced The body of birth is not eternal Who drinks the sacred water of life In our short lives let us enjoy The winds of heaven are beyond touch The lives of men are not eternal Who drinks the sacred water of life In our short lives let us enjoy The singers voice cracked as his lyric soared and trembled Quickly the other men took up the chant repeating the singsong verses embellishing on them Voices broke above the mass to carry the words higher The song spread ahead of the prince greeting him at every turn on the way to the khahans tent It seemed that every trooper turned out along their march Khans knelt in respect as the prince rode by Men even the horribly wounded struggled to get to the front of the press where they could make themselves seen Koja watched as a crippled trooper his foot lost in yesterdays battle was carried forward by his companions his pallet hoisted over their heads It seemed to take all his effort to sing the simple lyric but sing he did hoarsely bawling out the words A surging mass of men followed them up the hill to the khahans tent As their numbers grew the tension increased Let us see the khahan someone screamed Let us see his body There was a grumbling swell underneath the song as more and more men called out to see the khahans bier Guards keep them out Jad shouted over the noise as he entered Yamuns compound The dayguards dashed forward forming a triple line around the gate Their weapons glinted in the sun a bristling line of sword points Officers on horseback shouted commands their steeds prancing behind the line The menacing black forms of the dayguards pushed forward forcing the crowd back Jad and the rest of his party disappeared into Yamuns tent Sechen at the rear Koja hurried to check the khahan Yamun was still alive and breathing a victory for the day The blankets were soaked in sweat and his color was still like that of the ice high in the mountains of Khazari Hastily Koja stripped off the coverlets and demanded new ones A quiverbearer hastened to fulfill the request Jad came to the sickbed and watched for a moment saying nothing The khahan was asleep and there was little the prince could do Satisfied that Koja was attending to Yamun he turned back to Goyuk The old khan had just finished offering a prayer to the small felt idols that hung over the door Reaching into a bucket of kumiss by the sill Goyuk dipped his fingers in the brew and sprinkled it on each idol He kowtowed to the little red cloth figures and then turned to join the others You should remember the old ways Jadaran Khan chided Goyuk Teylas be angry with you He pointed to the doorway leaving no doubt what he wanted the prince to do Jad held his tongue Although Goyuk was presumptuous to speak that way to him the prince knew that the old man was right Obediently he knelt down at the door and offered up his prayer going through all the motions to make the ablution Outside the doorway he could hear the muffled chanting of the men Jad wondered how long they would be satisfied to wait Goyuk beamed a toothless smile as Jad finished the ritual You are a good son Maybe you make a good khahan too The suggestion caught the prince by surprise My father isnt dead yet he snapped The weight and pressure of the day were catching up with him and Goyuks intimation only added to his rage and frustration No no of course not Goyuk quickly agreed But the time may come The prince let himself relax slightly accepting Goyuks explanation If it comes to that I hope Ill have your support There are many things I dont know much I need to learn Youve always served father well and Id like you to do the same for me Of course said the old man following Jad back to the sickbed Lama how is the khahan Koja frowned The sweating may have driven the poison out of his blood Jad nodded impassively Are you certain he pressed Koja bit at his lip then replied honestly No Prince Jadaran I think that he will live I cannot promise that he will live Jad walked to the yurts door and beckoned Koja to his side The prince pulled open a corner of the door flap as Koja joined him Hear the men lama he asked putting his hand on Kojas shoulder They fought for him If his assassins were alive that crowd would rip them apart with their hands and then feed the guts to the jackals If he dies in your care I could not stop them I still cannot promise you anything Koja insisted He stepped away from the door and looked Jad firmly in the eye I do not want to fail Nor do I echoed Jad He looked back out the doorway and coldly murmured I wish I could give them the ones behind all this Especially Bayalun This you cannot do consoled Goyuk his sharp ears picking up Jads softly spoken words from across the tent Jad let the tent flap drop Why not Her wizard struck down my father he argued The men would believe me You have no proof she do this Goyuk said tapping the carpet where he sat to emphasize his point Think like your father She has many relatives many friends You must have proof not suspicions Besides the wizards and shamans protect her Then what do I do Jad cried in frustration I need proof before I can act but this viper works freely against us I need to find Yamuns killer Wait Jad Be like the tiger hunting for the deer Whoever it is will make a mistake It will happen soon Goyuk advised Ambition will cause them to blunder We must wait until that happens How long can we keep the army together just waiting We need to do something Jad squatted beside Goyuk looking to the old khan for guidance It was Koja however who spoke from the side of Yamuns sickbed A funeral If the khahan is supposed to be dead there must be a funeral Jad glared over at the lama What good will that do priest It will only remind them the khahan is dead Koja stood and moved to where the two men sat It will keep the khans busyand keep them following your orders And it may give your father time to get well Jad stopped and considered Kojas words He glanced to Goyuk and the old khan nodded in agreement If you give orders for the funeral Koja continued the khans still listen to your words They will grow used to following your commands It will keep them from grumbling and give the men an outlet for their pain Jad chin sunk to his chest watched Koja while the priest explained his plan As he finished the prince raised his head and spoke You are much more than a simple lama I see why father has seen fit to name you his anda Reunion Bayalun stood in front of her yurt with Chanar at her side Surrounding both of them were Bayaluns guards The troopers stood tensely alert as the khadun read from an ancient scrap of yellow paper Chanar peeked at it over her shoulder He could reada little anywayand wasnt about to miss a chance to show off his meager skill to Bayalun To his dismay what he saw was unintelligible a strange and twisted script Worse still for his pride Bayalun read from the unrolled sheet with ease her tongue tripping over the tortured phrases As she spoke a gloom settled over them and the colors leached away from everything Chanar tensed with fear as the world went graythe white robes of the guards Bayaluns black hair the red silks of his own shirt even the orange glow of the fire Then there was nothing Abruptly there was something Solid ground slammed up under his feet wiping away the brief feeling of floating Chanar staggered but several of the guards stumbled and fell Bayalun managed to remain on her feet with ease At any rate they had arrived in Yamuns camp And apparently they were not welcome The men of Yamuns Kashik who surrounded them held drawn swords ready The guards were a grizzled group seasoned campaigners wearing dirty black kalats stained with blood They watched the newcomers with hard stares Black beards and braids were thick and foul with grease Only their scarred cheeks were free of the filth Chanar recognized many and knew their names from previous battles Watching them the general moved slowly and carefully These guards were poised to strike It was clear in the way they stood the way they held their swords and the friendless look in their eyes Bayaluns guards stood no less at the ready their sword tips wavering in anticipation Chanar slowly drew himself up He was a khan a prince of the Tuigan not some thief Looking his imposing best in a red robe and gold vest embroidered with blue dragons Chanar glowered at the Kashik around him Let me pass I bring the khadun of the Tuigan to see the body of her husband Chanar shouted His face was clouded and dark and his eyes narrowed to hard unfriendly slits The battlehardened bloodthirsty old brawler in him rose to the fore Clear the way or die he bellowed drawing his sword with a menacing flourish The generals shoulders heaved as he pumped himself up with fury and courage The Kashik shifted on the balls of their feet preparing to meet his charge They had their orders and Chanars threats were not about to make them falter General Chanar you cannot teach asses courtesy Bayalun said softly The general glared at her for having the audacity to interfere at such a critical point Put away your sword These ugly mules havent the wit to be frightened You She pointed at the largest guard with a flick of her finger Go and ask Yamuns son if the khadun must change his guards into the asses they truly are Then he can bray out his orders to them She smiled wickedly an easy feat for her The fellow whom Chanar recognized as an old tough sergeant named Jalibukha went dead white at Bayaluns words Eyes wide open with fear the sergeant nodded and quickly ran toward the khahans yurt Bayalun looked at Chanar with a triumphant smile It will not be long she confidently predicted With difficulty Chanar swallowed his pride He was one of Yamuns seven valiant men He didnt need a woman to tell common warriors to get out of his way Someday he knew there would come a time when her words and threats would no longer suffice Then she would have to come to him for support Behind his back Mother Bayalun hid her contemptuous smile The general believes he can do this alone she thought But she reminded herself the dear general is necessary The wizards and some of the people might follow her but the rest of the army would never accept Bayaluns commands She needed General Chanar to keep Yamunsherempire intact The sergeant reached the door of the khahans yurt less than one hundred yards away Barely waiting to be announced he threw open the tent flap and breathlessly stood in the doorway Seeing the prince glaring at him for the intrusion the sergeant flung himself to the ground Prince Jadaran I bring a message he declared while gasping for breath Eke Bayalun and General Chanar they have just arrived What the prince exclaimed Here He clenched his fists in frustration With a curt wave he dismissed the sergeant and then spun back to the others What are we going to do He whirled on Goyuk expecting the advisor to instantly provide an answer Show them in came a weak voice from the other side of the tent Astonished Jad turned slowly toward the source There on his sickbed was Yamun Somehow he had struggled up onto one elbow raising his head enough to look at them His face was hollow and pale A tic quivered his cheek a small sign of the massive effort he was expending Get me up he whispered hoarsely I will meet with my wife Koja hurried to his side quickly mounding pillows for Yamun to lean on Father youre not strong enough Jad protested There must be something else we can do No Bayalun must know I live Otherwise she will make trouble And Chanar deserves to know the truth His voice trailed off weakly The khahan rested for a little before speaking again Go Greet them Give me some time but dont tell them I live I will be ready Jad stood still uncertain if he should obey these orders Koja looked up firmly meeting Jads gaze We will make sure Yamun is ready Let all who disobey you know this is by the word of the khahan Yamun mumbled reciting the formula Even in his weak voice there was no uncertainty Resigned Jad bowed to his father and turned to go And order the Kashik to double their guard Yamun added as his son departed Accompanied by the sergeant Jad marched the short distance to where Bayalun and Chanar waited The Kashik stepped aside to let the prince pass Greetings Mother Jad said with forced civility There was little warmth in his voice although nothing in his expression noted anything less than filial love You should have warned of your coming A proper reception couldvewellbeen prepared His smile was broad and utterly heartless I am sure your preparations would have been most complete Bayalun parried She did not even bother to pretend friendship to her stepson We did not want to put you to such trouble Using her staff Bayalun pushed her way past Jad and began marching toward the khahans tent ignoring everyone around her She continued to talk unconcerned whether Jad was following her or not In Quaraband there are rumors that Yamun is slain I came to investigate these Now I see the mourning banner in front of my husbands tent Why was I not informed The prince quickstepped to fall in beside Bayalun avoiding the backswing of her staff as he did so We had no one who could reach you quickly Weve sent a messenger It was a part lie he and Goyuk had carefully avoided letting the news travel beyond the camp What about Afrasib my wizard He could have reached me the khadun asked warily I think not He died in yesterdays battle slain by the Khazari Jad lied The old sorceress stopped suddenly taken aback by her stepsons announcement Afrasib is dead she asked in sad disbelief It is not possible Most certainly hes dead His body was brought back from the field of battle Jad couched his words carefully this time I shall see his body later Bayalun decided brushing an errant gray hair from her face As Bayalun came to the doorway two more Kashik stepped in front of her blocking the way with crossed swords Irritated the khadun poked at them with the gold head of her staff Although they flinched as she thrust it forward neither man moved Unless you want me to hurt these men she snapped at the prince you should order them to move She squinted at the guards with mock ferocity and wagged her staff under their noses They only want to protect you from evil spirits There is death here the prince explained reminding her of the old taboos The yurt is illomened Yamuns body lies inside Jad carefully avoided making eye contact with his stepmother I have seen enough death that this will do me no harm Bayalun informed her stepson Taking up her staff the khadun thrust it forward The sleeve on her arm fell back revealing the smooth golden skin that belied her age Bayalun pushed the guards aside and stooped through the doorframe Jad waited for Chanar to enter then brought up the rear trying to suppress his panic Had he stalled long enough Was the khahan ready to receive them He edged his hand to his sword in case things went badly Bayalun took only a single step through the door and stopped Chanar his head bowed to get through the door bumped into the khadun and stepped back in surprise Looking over Bayaluns shoulder he lurched back farther in greater astonishment Jad easily slid to the side out of the way his eyes goggling at Yamuns throne Bayalun let out a sharp gasp of incredulity and her staff almost slipped from her grasp General Chanar simply gaped in shock There opposite them was Yamun alive and sitting on his throne His legs were spread his hands resting on his knees his head held upright chin jutting forward He was dressed in his finest armor a bribe the emperor of Shou Lung had sent a year ago The metal gleamed in the dim lighta golden breastplate sculpted with muscles a pair of flaring silver shoulderguards a skirt of the finest metal chain and a helm of gemencrusted brass and gold tapered and fluted to a point A pure white horsetail braided with ribbons of red silk hung down from the helmets tip Under all the trappings it was difficult almost impossible to see Yamuns face The lamps were hung far and high from the khahans seat casting his features into darkness His hands were covered with thick gauntlets At the head of the mens seats close to the khahan sat Koja crosslegged The holloweyed priest studied the pair who had just entered with anxious curiosity Beside him was Goyuk still dressed in the filthy robes from yesterdays battle The old khan had dug out his pipe and was carefully tamping it full of tobacco He glanced toward Bayalun and Chanar and then returned his attention to his pipe scarcely giving them any notice Behind the khahan were the nightguards At their head stood Sechen his arms hidden in the folds of his kalat The guards stood stiffly erect their eyes boring in on the visitors They made no attempt to hide their hatred Come forward the khahan said softly His resonant voice carried clearly across the room Cautiously eyeing all those around her Bayalun walked forward Chanar strode beside her though his gait was less swaggering than normal Bayalun was the first to gather her wits She cleverly composed in a simple refrain chanting it in a droning melody Greetings honorable son who rises again Your grieving mother is pleased to see you Your grieving wife is pleased to see you Double blessings flow like water upon me Yamun bowed his head slightly toward his stepmother Sit he whispered pointing to a seat about halfway up the womens row Bayalun obediently took the seat accepting the slight insult the position implied without comment Sit the khahan said in a stronger voice indicating a seat for Chanar beside Goyuk Chanar hesitated for the seat put him at a lower rank than the priest He started to protest then thought better of it There was a strained silence and for a moment Yamuns head sagged The illustrious second wife watched the khahan with keen interest Prince Jad near the door of the yurt silently drew his sword and caught the eyes of Sechen The giant nodded slightly indicating his readiness Have this pipe Great Lord old Goyuk said brazenly sliding forward to hand Yamun the bowl he had prepared Abruptly the khahans head snapped up Ill smoke Yamun answered his voice sounding a little hollow Taking the pipe he lit it and took several long puffs enjoying the sharp flavor of the exotic tobacco Koja offered a silent prayer to the TenThousand Protective Images of Furo At the back of the yurt the prince once again relaxed his stance Youve heard evil rumors no doubt Yamun finally said Rumors that assassins were sent to kill me So no doubt you hurried here to prove to your own minds how wrong these rumors were Bayalun studied the khahan closely trying to see if his image was some illusion created by the priest At the same time she quickly reviewed the spells she had ready just in case there were more surprises Sadly there was truth in the rumors Have the guards bring the body Yamun commanded Sechen The towering fellow left his position and exited the tent Yamun continued Yesterday during battle a creature tried to kill me It failed because my anda At this the khahan tipped his head toward the priest He fought to protect me Let us drink to his fortune With a feeble wave he had the servants bring ladles of black kumiss Hands shaking he raised his ladle to his lips and tipped his head back for a drink As he drank his face came out of shadow Bayalun clearly saw the deathly color of his cheeks which were gleaming with cold sweat from the mere effort of sitting up Chanar sat ramrodstraight his hard narrow eyes on the lama The others raised their ladles and slurped the drink The general though sat still refusing to salute the priest As the group finished the toast Sechen coughed discreetly from the door Yamun acknowledged his presence and everyone turned to watch as the huge Kashik pulled open the door flap There wrapped in a freshly butchered horsehide was the body of the hu hsien The guards kept it just outside the door so that it wouldnt pollute the khahans yurt Even knowing who or what the body was Koja found the creature hard to identify Its fur had already lost the luster it possessed in life The gash in its chest was crudely closed but the decay and corruption had not stopped Bayalun looked at the body briefly only long enough to satisfy herself that it was the Shou assassin the mandarin had provided It only confirmed what she now expected so she easily concealed the few emotions seeing the body evoked Mother Bayalun was disappointed She had expected much more from the great empire of Shou Lung Their token of support a lone assassin had failed Now she would have to press them for greater commitment Chanar on the other hand looked at the thing with disgust and fascination Hed never seen such a creature It didnt surprise him that Bayalun would use beasts and not men He could see now why her plans had failed relying as they did on such creatures There are also rumors Yamun said thinly interrupting the contemplation of the body that you Mother were somehow responsible for this He paused Unconsciously the khahan tugged gently at his mustache his body sagging forward as he did so Of course this isnt true Still it would end these rumors if you swore an oath of loyalty to your khahan Bayalun glared coldly at her stepson In icy measured tones she said You would make your mother and your wife swear to you Men will say you are without morals for this perversion Men will say worse of you if you refuse Yamun snapped suddenly revealing surprising strength Will the khans hear how you are afraid of Teylass wrath Yamun braced himself once more against his knees Bayalun realized that she stood alone Chanar could not would not come to her aid without arousing suspicion Bitterly the woman agreed Never before in our history has the khahan dared to demand this of his khadun May Teylas find this offensive to his sight She turned and spat on the rugs Teylas can make of it what he wants Now say the oath Yamun commanded By his tone it was clear he would brook no more argument Bayalun stared at her husband weighing her choices She could hear his armor creak to his labored breathing At last she kowtowed before the khahan With her face pressed into the rugs she recited the ancient words Although your descendants have only a scrap of meat thrown on the grass which not even the crows will eat although your descendants have only a scrap of fat which not even the dogs will eat even then my family will serve you Never will we raise the banner of another to sit upon the throne As this is heard by the khahan Illustrious Emperor of the Tuigan so it is heard by Teylas Yamun murmured in response His body sank slightly as he recited the words Now dear Bayalun youre tired This audience is over Burning with humiliation the khadun struggled from the floor pushing herself up with her staff Eschewing the traditional formalities of departing she barged from the yurt driving aside the guards with a few solid whacks of her stout wooden shaft Chanar you will stay I have questions for you the khahan ordered when the general stood to go Chanar froze briefly panicked and then slowly sat back down He looked around wondering if the audience was about to turn into some sort of trap Yamun deliberately let Chanar sit and wait Just as Koja decided that the khahan had passed out inside his armor Yamun spoke General Chanar my anda why arent you in Semphar advising Hubadai He let his voice trail away at the end I was ill and could not travel Chanar answered stiffly He placed his hands very carefully in front of him I sent messengers telling you of my sickness You couldve ridden in a cart or were you too sick to travel at all Yamun asked I am not an old man Chanar stopped suddenly and gave a quick glance to Goyuk The khans normally pleasant smile was clouded and grim I am not a woman Chanar began again who cannot ride Valiant men do not follow oxen to the battle I could not fight from a wagon It is true a warrior should ride into battle Yamun agreed Im pleased to see that youre feeling much better Now that you are well why have you come here Wary of the khahans maneuvering the general picked his words carefully He looked at the floor in mock humility The khadun suspected an evil fate had struck you and came to learn the truth I could not allow the khadun to travel without a proper guard Metal scraped wood as the khahan shifted in his seat So you came for the sake of my mother Learn this khans Yamun said louder addressing Goyuk and Jad General Chanar has shown us the proper thing to do It is true I have chosen two worthy andas the warrior and the lama Let us drink to their health The kumiss was drunk and the toasts were made Throughout the salutes Koja tried to stay quiet and avoid Chanars attention There could be no misreading the angry looks the general gave him over each ladleful of fermented milk Koja could also see that Yamun was weakening the ladle shaking a little more each time the khahan raised it to his lips Yamun the priest finally called out Chanar is surely tired from todays traveling However he is too noble to complain so let me speak for him and ask that this audience end The khahan turned toward Koja about to lash out at the priest for such impudence when he suddenly saw the wisdom of the lamas words Turning back to Chanar he held one hand up to send the servants back to their places My anda Koja is wise Ive kept you too long Chanar Ong Kho This audience is over now and you may leave The warlord sat gaping then with a crash hurled the ladle across the yurt spraying kumiss over the rugs He does not speak for me I need no one to speak for me I am your anda he shouted Not waiting for a reply Chanar stormed out of the yurt savagely shoving the guards at the door out of his way The door flap had barely been tied shut when Yamun toppled off the throne Arms weakly flailing he grabbed at the screen only to succeed in pulling it over with him The khahan tumbled from the dais in a crash of metal and cracking wood The gleaming brass helmet popped off his head and bounced across the floor Koja sprang to his feet hastening to the side of the stricken khahan Quickly he examined the fallen leader He lives thankfulness be to Furo but he needs rest the priest announced as he tugged off Yamuns armor Help me get him to bed You shouldnt have put him in that heavy armor the prince snapped as he hoisted the khahan to his feet halfdragging him to his bed The khahan insisted on it I did not want it Koja shot back trying to keep his temper under control Jad too bit back his words That would be like father he conceded He is strongwilled Koja noted as they laid Yamuns unconscious body on the bed Goyuk stood near the door making sure they were not interrupted More than you know lama Jad agreed He looked Koja in the eye I was wrong to accuse you Together the pair finished making the khahan comfortable When they were done Jad called Goyuk from the door Wise advisors he began nodding to both Goyuk and Koja Bayalun knows our tricks What do we do now He knows about you Chanar snapped hysterically his composure completely shattered He looked at Mother Bayalun sitting opposite him his eyes flashing with panic and rage He suspects dear Chanar If he could prove anything we would be dead by now the matronly Bayalun corrected Her voice was low and ripplingly musical She took the generals hand in hers and gave it a reassuring squeeze They sat alone in a small yurt she had appropriated from one of the commanders of Yamuns bodyguard Influential and important though the Kashik khans might be not even they dared refuse the illustrious second empress It was a simple matter for her to find a tent to her liking and then persuade its owner to vacate Indeed the khan had been most willing he believed the khahan dead making this a good time to be friendly and helpful to the khadun Still the usurped accommodations were far from lavish The tent was small and cramped divided into two sections Bayalun and Chanar sat in a small reception area A pair of small wooden chests covered with rugs served as chairs The khadun had disdained these choosing instead to sit on the floor next to the oil lamp which provided a feeble glow A fine bow of antler horn and lacquered wood and a quiver of red leather hung on the wall behind one seat marking it as the masters spot A suit of iridescent armor carefully tended and decoratedperhaps the khans finest possessionhung on a stand nearby Weapons helmets shields buckets and utensils decorated the rest of the wall space A folding wooden screen separated the other half of the yurt from the reception area On the other side of the screen was the private areaa small collapsible bed with a carved and inlaid headboard and chests of clothing and war booty How long before his suspicion gives way to certainty the general countered slowly pulling his hand free from Bayaluns He closed his eyes and rubbed hard at his temples struggling to regain control of his emotions Blood throbbed through the veins of his forehead and the shaven top of his head His shoulders ached from the tension Why cant we just raise our standard and attack him nowjust get it over with We should defeat him in battle not with a game of words Patience my bold warrior Bayalun gently urged She smiled warmly His sudden display of temper threatened all her plans and yet fascinated her Forgive me You are a man of deeds and I have forgotten this Blood and the sword are meat for you not politics and words Patience There will be battles Im sure but not yet Chanar could not help but notice the change in her tone The khadun moved closer to Chanar It was important now more than ever that the general do nothing rash that he be placated She needed to control him but let him think he was in command Let Yamun suspect Bayalun continued her voice dropping to soft murmur We will find a way to distract the khahan She took Chanars hands again and gently pulled the general to her He gave a slight resistance at first then took her in his arms She stroked his tanned scalp and the thick brown braids that gathered over his ears Caressingly she tugged at his tunic slowly undoing its clasps The sun only weakly warmed the layer of frosty dew that covered the ground the next morning On the plain where the dead lay the days chorus of jackals and vultures was beginning Listening to their cries an almost comforting sound Chanar stretched grandly in the doorway of Bayaluns yurt There was a rustling noise behind him as the khadun stepped into the small reception area adjusting her headdress Yamuns death standard still stands Bayalun Chanar commented He did not turn from the doorway Coming up behind the general she peered over his shoulder Good It gives us more time There are many things we must plan Now come and eat A small tray set with cups of salted tea soured mares milk curds and chunks of sugar had been prepared by her guards The second empress motioned Chanar to sit as she sipped at her tea Chanar could tell by the set of Bayaluns jawline that she had already been thinking of the distraction they needed Taking up a cup he settled back to listen leaning comfortably against one of the chests Did you see the khahans face yesterday The khadun didnt wait for an answer It was pale and his voice was weaker than I have ever heard He did not escape my assassin Hes been hurt She stared into her salted tea He wants to be dead so he can heal We must force him into the open before he is ready Chanar nodded Easily said but everyone believes him dead I have a plan Which khans are friendly to you Chanar began to rebraid his hair He thought for a few seconds while he worked SeveralTanjin Secen Geser Chagadai Enough Talk to them If the khahan is dead then there must be a couralitai to select a new khahan the sharpwitted Bayalun explained A couralitai Chanar exclaimed with a contemptuous laugh Itll take months to gather all the khans for a council By then Yamun will be healed and there wont be a need to pick a new khahan Bayalun youve lost your cunning The khadun ignored his slight No your khans must insist on it now She touched his chest with her staff Think about it The Tuigan are fighting two warsone with Semphar and one here Things could go badly without a khahan Yamuns sons might fight each other for the throne A decision must be made immediately She lowered her staff These are the things you must tell your khans to make them worry Then they will insist on the couralitai They will even believe it is the right thing to do Now do you see Chanar stopped braiding and pondered her words Thats true I could speak to the khans But Yamun might let the couralitai happen Jad might take command the general said trying to see all the strategies all the complications The khahan will not let it happen He will appear the second empress replied confidently True After all Prince Jad might lose Chanar mused thinking of his own supporters Thats not why Yamun will appear Its his pride that will force him into the open He wont let another be khahan not even his own son Bayalun returned to her breakfast That is why I know he will appear So you force him to come out Chanar conceded What good is that Bayalun smiled not the tender smile of the night before but the scheming look Chanar had come to know It drove a shiver of fear through him the feeling he sometimes got on the verge of battle When Yamun is weak and in the open we will find a way to strike at him she promised Their plans decided the two plotters set to work All morning Chanar made calls on his fellow khans dropping suggestions hints and ominous predictions At first skeptical of Bayaluns scheme Chanar was surprised at how receptive the khans were to his words The couralitai gave them a course of action more so even than Jads funeral plan The khans began to clamor for the couralitai threatening to leave if their demands were not met It was late in the afternoon of the same day when Jad insisted upon a council of war Koja tried to prevent it arguing that the khahan was still too weak but the prince would hear none of it I want a meeting with my father he demanded The armys breaking up and theres a new problem Envoys from Manass have arrived to negotiate a peace I dont know what to do Goyuk should be there too he knows whats going on And you too priest No amount of debate was going to sway Jad so Koja resigned himself to the meeting Perhaps the prince was right he thought Things were getting out of control He had heard the rumors among the guards There was already talk of choosing a new khahan They needed a plan In a short time Jad Goyuk and Koja presented themselves to the khahan Yamun looked stronger and there was more color in his cheek but his voice was still shaky and weak He was sitting up in his bed when they entered wearing an erminetrimmed robe lined with yellow silk Koja had insisted that he put on clean clothes as part of the healing process In truth the priest only wanted to get rid of the smell Jad wasted little time with ceremony Father your deaths gone on long enough he began almost as soon as everyone was seated The khans are talking demanding a couralitai Theyre stirring up the men I cannot hold the army together any longer Yamun looked surprised by the news A couralitai takes many months to prepare My time of mourning isnt even over They want one now Goyuk explained his wrinkled face lined even more deeply with concern They say the army needs a leader His gums smacked together as if to accentuate the point Its worse Father added Jad bowing his head The envoys from Manass have come and are impatient to begin negotiations Thats given the khans more to complain about Already Chagadai and Tanjin have threatened to return to their pastures Thats four minghans four thousand men Father Yamun considered the situation absentmindedly twisting the sheets Anda is my mother still in camp Yes Yamun answered Koja Could this be Bayaluns doing the khahan feebly growled as he slapped the bed with a resounding thud Or is it spies from Shou Lung There was silence from the group as they mulled over the possibilities No one offered any answers Yamun you cannot sit here waiting for something to happen You should make a plan Koja suggested speaking hesitantly My anda is right Tell them to call a couralitai the khahan announced He choked back a small cough What sputtered Jad Why not just appear Show youre alive Someone is manipulating all this Yamun declared with certainty Ill show myself but only after they make their move Lets give our mysterious enemy what he wants then see what happens Call it for tomorrow Lord Yamun if there is a couralitai you must appearto prove you are not dead Otherwise they will pick a new khahan Koja pointed out I know this Dont worry anda Ill rest Now go With a tired wave Koja and the others were dismissed from the khahans presence As he stepped into the afternoon sunlight Koja realized that it had been days since hed last made any notes for Yamuns chronicle He wondered how much he could remember As a historian he was doing a poor job Wearily the lama wandered to his tent to fulfill his duty as grand historian The Couralitai By the earliest light of the next dawn word of the couralitai had spread throughout the camp Already the khans were gathering for the meeting moving from yurt to yurt to share the rumors and gossip that would affect the days business Standing near the Great Yurt Koja could almost hear the chorus of speculation and rumors With keen patient interest the priest watched the ebb and flow of the khans General Chanar emerged from the yurt of Tanjin Khan and exchanged friendly banter with the minghan commander Koja watched him next cross the camp to another tent that of Unyaid a minor commander in the Kashik Even earlier Bayalun had been moving about her staff echoing with its distinctive thunk on the hard ground The priest had not seen her for some time As Koja watched Jad and Goyuk came his way They had been out that morning probing the khans and listening to the rumors The three shared their information Koja described Bayaluns movements and noted Chanars with curiosity Goyuk and Jad outlined the mood of the khans who would side with them and who would not After making new plans Jad and Goyuk returned to their rounds sounding out the khans Koja maintained his watch of Bayaluns movements As the lama waited the quiverbearers began preparing for the grand meeting The gathering was to take place inside Yamuns compound about one hundred feet from the khahans yurt in a large open area surrounded by the tents of the Kashik khans A bonfire mounded with valuable pieces of wood was built at the far side of the clearing The khahans death banner was moved from Yamuns yurt and staked on the side of the circle opposite the bonfire Young boys carefully swept the ground with broad brushes and others rolled out rugs in two arcs to provide seating Beyond the circle of the couralitai servants were brewing tea at small fires preparing for the arrival of the khans Leather bags fashioned from the skins of horses heads were filled with kumiss and set out along with ladles Special seats for Bayalun and Jad were put up beneath the black yaktail standard Between these was a special vacant seat for the departed khahan A horn blew a wheezing offkey note It sounded easily over the subdued clatter of the quiverbearers They quickly finished their tasks and faded to the edges of the circle The khans began to arrive and take seats Those khans friendly to Bayalun sat on the left of the banner near her seat while Jads supporters filled the places to the right Most of the khans took places far from both the prince and the khadun declaring their current neutrality The spaces on the rugs began to get crowded Deciding there was no more he could do where he was Koja hurried to find a spot with a good view of the action before it was too late The priest squeezed in finding a space among the densely packed Tuigan As a foreigner he had no vote in the the proceedings but even being allowed to watch was a great privilege The horn blew again From the far side of the assembly entered Mother Bayalun Chanar following a few paces behind The khadun was dressed in white robes her long loose hair halfhidden by a white shawl A broad sash woven with stripes of blue and red hung around her neck She walked slowly but firmly across the circle to take her seat at the head of the assembly Chanar took a position among the khans sitting on the left The horn blew for a third time Koja sitting between a stiffbacked blackrobed commander of the Kashik and a belching greasyhaired khan whose name he did not know tensed in anticipation Instead of the surprise he expected however Koja was disappointed to see only Jad and Goyuk venture out to join the couralitai The prince took his seat barely acknowledging his stepmother Goyuk stood quietly behind him ready to advise the khahans son The khans fell silent expecting the first words of the session By tradition these were spoken by the son of the departed Jad raised his hand and waited for the last murmuring khans to fall quiet Satisfied that he had their attention the prince stood up before the assembled nobles Jadaran of the Hoekun welcomes you As khan of the Tuigan he welcomes you Let this council begin With these words the council was open Custom gave the honor of the next speech to the commander of the Kashik A strong clear voice suddenly rang out Illustrious youth son of our beloved khahan commander of forty thousand this one requests that he may be heard There was a buzz of excitement at these words The speaker had made the request in most respectful language using all the proper forms and inflectionsbut it was not the commander of the Kashik At the far side of the council the wolffaced Chagadai dressed in a ragged and filthy kalat stood to address the prince He wore a dirty white turban in the style of the western clans Without waiting to be recognized he pushed his way to the center of the circle The Kashik commander sitting near Jad glared at the speaker The upstart had deliberately insulted him The commander looked to Jad for guidance but the prince was in as much consternation as he Goyuk leaned forward and whispered in the princes ear Jad spoke a few words in response obviously debating with the old man about what could be done Next to him Bayalun sat unmoved by the startling turn A faint smile played across her lips Finally Jadaran looked toward the upstart khan Throwing a resigned look the commanders way the prince conceded reciting the formula required of him As lord of this couralitai I will hear Chagadai speak May the thanks of Teylas be upon the noble prince answered the renegade khan Now that he was recognized he turned to his fellow nobles in the audience Hear me khans Know that I am Chagadai of the Uesgir I will not waste time retelling the deeds of my family or all the greatness of the khahan These things we know Instead I ask a question we have all been wonderingwhere is the khahan Where is the one who has led our people to greatness They he shouted turning toward Jad say he has fallen Yet they do nothing Jad tensed and prepared to interrupt when Goyuk once again whispered in his ear The prince bit his lip and nodded curtly waiting for Chagadai to continue What is the duty of a son Chagadai quietly asked stepping closer to the prince When the father is killed the son should not hide in his tent He should find the murderers There was a grumble among the nobles Prince Jadaran squirmed angered by the accusation Chanar watched coolly from his seat his tented fingers touched against his lips Bayaluns smile had vanished leaving her face a blank Chagadai turned back to the assembled nobles There are ambassadors from Khazari in our camp They arrived only yesterday Now why do ambassadors from our enemy come just when we are in our mourning Do they come to share our sorrow The khan stopped to mop the nervous sweat from his neck They come to negotiate to negotiate with Jadaran Khan in our hour of victory He is taking our victory from us Your warriors died in this battle Chagadai stopped pacing down the length of the couralitai There was a growing undertone of discontent among Bayaluns allies Theatrically turning to them Chagadai asked Is this who should be khahan Let us choose another Jad moved to stand only to be stopped by Goyuks hand on his shoulder Let him speak the old advisor whispered This is what we want The prince sank back down his eyes smoldering with hatred Let Chanar Ong Kho be khahan shouted a voice from the ranks of the seated khans Several of the younger nobles on Bayaluns side clapped their hands showing their support The priest glanced around Jads supporters at least those willing to show their loyalty were few in number It seemed that the prince faced a serious challenge to his authority Chanar Ong Kho must be khahan cried the voice again To everyones surprise Chanar shook his head refusing to accept the offer The general rose to address the assembly I thank the wise khans but these words are disrespectful to the memory of the khahan I am not worthy of this honor Let the nomination go to another There was a sigh of disappointment from Bayaluns side of the group Chagadai still standing in the center of the council refused to relent He pressed the offer again Let Chanar be khahan The man stopped his pace near Jad Again the prince made to stand only to be restrained by the gentle touch from Goyuk The clapping for Chanar was louder this time Chagadai glanced toward Bayalun She gave a quick smile of approval The khan was doing well acting just as she had instructed him this morning Slowly Chagadai faced all the assembly once more Chanar will not be khahan he said with disappointment in his voice Still Jad must show his worth Perhaps the khahans killers have been found and perhaps his body is in his yurt But we have not seen the body Jad tells us what happened but shows us no proof Are we sure the khahan was slain in battle Perhaps someone else killed him Someone who does not want us to know the truth Let us see Yamuns body and learn the truth for ourselves With those words Chagadai strode out of the clearing toward the door of Yamuns yurt Just as he reached it Sechen stepped forward and blocked the entrance with his sword Why is Jad afraid shouted Chagadai turning his back to the door so he could address the couralitai Caught up in the excitement and straining to see the nobles were on their feet Let us see the khahans body shouted many from the crowd Then see it you will said a voice behind Chagadai echoing from the doorway of the tent The khans in the crowd stopped their cries and froze in disbelief Standing in the doorway was Yamun Khahan He was dressed in coarse robes of blue serge cinched with a belt of leather and gold His hair was undone shaped in a halo around his shaven pate He leaned against the doorjamb to steady himself The khahan whispered the big crude khan next to Koja The assembly echoed the mans words like the breath of a wind spirit Several of the men abruptly knelt bowing their heads toward their risen leader Chagadai turned slowly toward his lord his eyes wide with shock and fear Yamun ignored the wolfish khan Pushing past Chagadai he slowly but steadily walked into the center of the couralitai Yamuns color was still pale and it was clear that every step drained away a little of his strength His brow glistened with sweat from the effort of each footstep Nevertheless the khahan never flinched At last Yamun reached the center of the circle swaying slightly on his feet He turned and scanned the faces of the khans in attendance Now who will be khahan he demanded as if he were some vengeful apparition No one answered No one it seemed could tear his eyes from the khahan Koja looked toward Bayalun She was once again smiling the same faintly triumphant smile that had crossed her face earlier Next to her Jad was watching the khans his smile equally triumphant as he searched out the slightest sign of opposition None shall be khahan but you dear husband Bayalun said diplomatically But some believing you dead were eager for a new khahan All eyes turned toward Chagadai His thin face grew pale They forgot what is proper and called for Chanar to be khahan ignoring your own sons They did not even wait the thirty days of mourning that tradition demands Bayalun tapped the ground with her staff for emphasis Chagadai nervously walked down the path trying to discreetly return to his place Those khans who had applauded his words sat very quietly in their seats doing nothing to attract attention to themselves Yamun turned toward the trembling Chagadai fixing the man to the spot with his fierce stare Those between the two men slid out of the way These words are true the khahan growled Great Lord Chagadai sputtered falling to one knee and bowing his head I did these things for the good of your people Hubadai attacks Semphar while we fight the Khazari We need guidance And my son isnt fit to rule This is treason The nobles whispered in fearful concern None however dared raise his voice in protest Husband and son Bayalun interjected he acted for the good of the Tuigan If Chagadai knew you lived he would not have spoken so Only a foolish man holds the pecking hawk close to his eyes Yamun angrily retorted using an old proverb to make his point Like the hawk Chagadai attacks me He has betrayed me Yamun strode to where the khan cowered Before anyone could object Yamun drew his sword and thrust it forward The sword pierced the khans chest There was a choked gasp of surprise from Chagadai then he flopped to the ground blood spurting from his wound The dying man twitched and jerked but finally lay still Yamun exhausted by the effort leaned on the sword its tip in the dirt blood running down the blade For a moment no one spoke The khans so vocal before were unwilling to draw Yamuns ire The khahan as he regained his breath grimly scanned the assembly looking for anyone who might challenge his actions Servants hurried forward and dragged the body away sweeping dirt over the dark stain of blood on the ground You have been told I died in battle Yamun finally said to his apprehensive audience This was a lie you say the khahan did not die Yamun wiped the bloody sword on his robe I remained hidden by my own command I wanted you my faithful khans to think me dead Why Great Khan why one of khans sitting on Jads side asked hesitantly I was attacked by assassins I was wounded but I live Teylas protected me from this evil attack He stopped to recover his strength Suddenly everyone could see his weakness Who did this to our khahan Bayalun called out She looked around waiting for an answer The Khazari answered one from Jads side of the couralitai Koja suddenly felt uncomfortable exposed The commander next to the priest swiveled slightly one hand on his sword On the other side the belching khan slid back not wanting to sit too close to the lama No not the Khazari Yamun snapped It was a Khazari who saved me from the assassins The lama Koja fought to protect me from my attackers For this Ive made him my anda The khans on either side of Koja eyed him with surprised respect Who then asked a khan Do you want to see my assassins Yamun asked feigning reluctance Weakened by the effort of speaking the khahan closed his eyes The wave of shouted approval from the khans rocked him slightly Slowly he took the empty seat between Jad and Bayalun The bodies Yes we will see the bodies the commander next to Koja shouted urging the khans around him to add their voices to the cry It quickly swelled and grew as khans from both sides expressed their outrage Yamun settled back confident that the khans still followed him The bodies bring the bodies went up the chant Yamun raised his hand commanding silence Loyal khans he shouted over the dying rumble drawing deeper on his reserves of strength You shall see them Sechen bring the assassins here In the brief moments it took to fetch the grim bundle Yamun sagged back in his seat The khahan Jad and Goyuk conferred quickly amongst themselves Sechen returned carrying the bloodstained rug and dropped it with a thud at Yamuns feet A wave of anticipation rippled through the nobles Now see who attacked your khahan Yamun solemnly announced An unclean creature and a man With the tip of his boot the khahan carefully pushed a fold of the rug aside A visible wave of pollution and decay marked by a cloud of flies rose up from the rotting bodies A gasp of astonishment came spontaneously from the assembled group A beast hissed a voice filled with disgust They send beasts to kill our khahan There were two bodies in the rug the hu hsien and the wizard The oncebright fur of the fox creature was stiff and dullcolored Its wounds more fearsome in death were sunken the edges soft and black Dark patches of decay spread from these mottling the skin beneath the bristling fur The eyes were gone pecked out by birds A purplish tongue dry and cracked lolled out of its mouth The human next to it was equally decayed the slashed throat gray and crusted Bayalun choked Afrasib She quickly clamped her mouth shut and avoided Yamuns gaze Her face was pale Leaning over she whispered a word to one of the khans beside her He nodded and slid back out of sight Who are they cried out a thin pockmarked khan pushing his way through his fellows to get a closer look at the corpses The other khans surged forward behind him The beast is a hu hsien a creature of Shou Lung Jad explained The other is the wizard Afrasib The prince stopped letting the khans form their own conclusions Eyes suspicious and hard started to turn toward Bayalun She met their gaze firmly not showing any fear Slowly and regally the khadun stood and walked to the dead bodies She studied the corpses poking at them with her staff The khans stepped back creating a circle around her She rolled Afrasibs head to the side Traitor she hissed Leaning over she spat onto the dead wizards face He has betrayed the khahan The Shou emperor must have bought his loyalty Bayalun announced turning back to her seat But who sent these killers the pockfaced khan asked his questions still not satisfied Who indeed Jad asked looking toward Bayalun The emperor of Shou uses things like the hu hsien as spies Bayalun countered as she stiffly sat down Ask Yamuns priest if this is not so It is true Yamun said In the crowd Koja started at the statement He didnt see why the khahan was siding with the khadun He must be must be planning something the lama decided This is what Shou Lung thinks of us sneered Yamun still talking Their emperor fears us so he sends evil spirits to kill me Do we fear the dogs of Shou No came the cry Even Chanar seemed roused by the khahans passionate boast Shall we sit here while they send killerslike this Yamun jabbed a finger toward the dead hu hsien He sends beasts to stalk us Are we deer before the hunter No came the shout again The khans were gripped by rage Koja was amazed Yamun showed no sign of the wounds that weakened him only a few minutes before The khahan stood tall his legs spread and set solidly Do we wait for them to destroy us all or do we act Yamun demanded raising his arms to the sky His eyes were fiery energetic and powerful filled with a blaze of bloodlust Koja gaped Hed seen the khahan like this only once before during the great storm at Quaraband The khans responded with an inarticulate roar too many voices trying to shout out their answer all at once There were those who dissented but their words were drowned out by the furious outrage of their fellows The flood of rage and anger seemed to invigorate Yamun even further He surveyed the khans with pride reveling in their fire and adulation He let the warriors have their way for a while then raised his hands for silence Reluctantly they hushed to hear his words Yamun pushed the khans back from the bodies clearing himself some space This Shou emperor has declared war on us What shall we do We must teach them a lesson roared out one of the khans Mongke by namea thin bony man with a powerful voice that belied his meager frame How demanded Koja boldly stepping into the circle What about the Dragonwall the great fortification that protects their border It has never been broken How will you get through that Irritated at the priests outburst some of the khans began to shout down his concerns We will conquer Shou because the emperor fears us Yamun stated with utter conviction If this Dragonwall was invincible the emperor would not fear me Teylas must have spared me to become a scourge on the emperor to break his unbreakable wall A raid suggested one of the Kashik khans No not a raid Yamun answered coolly More than a raid Well teach this emperor to fear We will conquer Shou Lung I Yamun Khahan will be the Illustrious Emperor of All People The khahan roared out the last words to the sky threatening as much as promising It is our destiny Yamuns eyes blazed He panted lustful for the challenge His heart longed for the fury of battle and the greatness conquest would bring to him The excitement of the khans formed into a chant It was as if Yamuns vision of conquest spread from him to them It leaped to the khans took possession of their spirit Even Koja felt the wild passion the lust to act that flowed from Yamun The khahan stepped back to his seat and surveyed the khans They looked to him in anticipation some eager a few fearful Who will go to war with me Who will share in the riches of Shou Lung he shouted to the masses The response came in a tumult of yells and clapping from the khans Koja in their midst was almost deafened by the warriors frantic shouts Yamun stood before his seat clearly enjoying the frenzy His eyes were wild and his face was flushed and pulsing with energy It seemed to the priest that the khahan had found his own cure Here again was the man who could withstand the might of a gods thunderbolts By the will of Teylas my khans we will ride to victory proclaimed the khahan The Dragonwall must fall Plots Yamun growled at his bodyguards ten Kashik warriors who circled him at a respectful distance One of them had clumsily bumped into an armor stand sending Yamuns gilt mail sprawling Fumbling to correct his error man made still more noise Yamun snarled impatiently for the mortified soldier to stop fussing It was one thing to have a bodyguard of ten thousand men who would make camp patrol at night and charge boldly into battle it was quite another thing to have an arban of soldiers hovering around you wherever you went The Kashik however upon learning that morning that their khahan still lived were determined to protect him at all times It was a great honor for the men chosen to guard the khahan but it was going to take time for Yamun to get adjusted Still the khahan knew better than to argue with the devotion and loyalty of his own men The guard finally finished straightening the gear and quietly took his place along the wall of the Great Yurt The other guards stood silently in their positions Satisfied that there would be no more disturbances Yamun resumed his conversation Sitting at the foot of Yamuns throne was his anda the grand historian Koja Well anda Yamun said to him soon therell be more to write in your histories if you have the time Theres much to be done before we march on Shou Lung The priest looked at Yamun sharply still puzzled by the events of the couralitai Why have you done this he finally asked You attack Shou Lung and ignore Bayalun Is this wise Yamun scowled Anda I did what I must He held out his fists Someone seeks to kill me Bayalun He closed one fist And Shou Lung He closed the other I will not ignore this insult But Shou Lung is the mightiest of nations protested Koja Why them and not Bayalun Bayalun is one of my people If I strike at her there will be dissension among the khans They will demand proof and the wizards will turn against me the khahan predicted Then my empire would be nothing He lowered his fists But if I attack Shou Lung my people will stand united in battle and I will be rid of one enemy Better one foe than two That is ruling is it not Koja swallowed hearing the determination in Yamuns voice But Shou Lung is huge And their emperor is afraid of me Scared men can be beaten Yamun confidently predicted Koja resigned himself to Yamuns decision What of Bayalun he asked as an afterthought Yamun dismissed her name with casual wave Now that I know her tricks she will be watched We will keep her here with us so she cant cause problems We will keep the snake under our heel I have decided Yamun noted idly abruptly changing the subject youll meet with these envoys from Khazari and handle the details of their surrender Ive got to make plans for our conquest of Shou Lung Me Yamun Have you forgotten that I am a Khazari I cant negotiate the surrender Koja protested Who said negotiate the khahan replied sharply Just accept their surrender But there must be terms I cant just tell them to give up Why not Yamun asked stroking the fine point of his mustache Theyve got no army to protect Manass I can destroy anything they send You tell them that There are too many things for me to do here There are orders to give and reports have just arrived from Hubadai in Semphar He pointed to the royal scribe next to whom sat a bundle of papers tied with yellow silk ribbons But they want my head the little lama sputtered nervously rubbing his scalp An ironic smile twisted the khahans scarred lips You will do this because I have ordered it They want your head so they no longer consider you a countryman You see you are no longer a Khazari Koja swallowed at Yamuns words What can I do Although he did not want this task at all it was clear that he had to accept the khahans will I want them to surrender Yamun repeated knowing that Koja expected more Very well I want goods equal to ten thousand bars of silver to be paid on the first moon of every new year Then they must turn over this governor his wizard and the Shou officials you described They escaped the battlefield and I want themor their heads and hands Koja waited for Yamun to outline more but the khahan had finished his demands That is not all the priest enjoined Yamun counted out his terms on his fingers Surrender goods and prisoners What else is there Exasperated Koja took paper and pen from the scribe spreading the sheet between himself and Yamun Koja quickly drew Khazaris borders Yamun these are not wandering tribesmen you have conquered The Khazari will not surrender and obey you just because you are khahan Then Ill destroy their homes and scatter the people among my khans Tell them that Yamun threatened No Yamun that will not do The Khazari are not like the tribes Koja dotted the map with the towns and cities of Khazari They have stone towns and fields They do not travel from camp to camp You must set someone to rule them pass laws and make judgments Yamun leaned forward to study Kojas map This is not our way he grumbled But because you say it must be done I will consider it For now tell the envoys they must give me Manass as my own Then they must tear down the walls around all their other ordus The khahan pushed the crude map away with his toe Make me a good map of Khazari anda Koja sighed and thought through the list of demands that Yamun had made And what can you negotiate on My anda there will be no negotiation Yamun loomed over the priest to add emphasis to his words And if they refuse Koja asked softly Yamun casually sipped from a cup of kumiss As I said I will destroy every ordu in Khazari Every male taller than the yoke of an oxcart will be put to the sword and all their wives and little children will be scattered as slaves among my people Their nation will be no more That I can do anda The khahan settled back into his seat Scribe write out my demands Ill put my seal to it Anda you can take that with you as proof The demands written Yamun turned to his scribe and ordered him to begin reading the stack of reports that sat beside him Koja rose to one knee and made a brief bow to the khahan before slowly backing out of his presence Rapt in Hubadais account of the fall of Semphar Yamun didnt even notice his departure In her commandeered yurt Mother Bayalun worked alone preparing to cast her magical spells The door to the yurt was carefully fastened sealing out all light and her guard had instructions not to let anyone disturb her not even Chanar her current paramour Her hands moving quickly the khadun set out the materials she needed a brazier containing a small glowing coal and a small pouch of powdered incense Softly in case anyone might be listening she muttered the incantation passing her hands over the brazier The words finished Bayalun flung a pinch of incense into the coals There was a brilliant puff and smoke coiled thickly into the air writhing and turning forming into the face of a Shou mandarin The smoke made the mans forehead appear soft and puffy like bread dough but his dark eyes shone clearly The smoky face blinked a few times in surprise as if the mandarin had been awoken by the spell Khadun of the Tuigan it rumbled in surprise with a hollowsounding voice you called me Indeed We must speak Her breath caused the outlines of the wraith to waver and shift Now is not the best time Eke Bayalun Khadun the face said the puffy features forming into something that looked like a scowl The emperor is giving a poetry reading It is difficult for me to concentrate on both As if to illustrate the point the cloudfaces eyes rolled back into its head The outlines started to spread and rise breaking up as the contact was momentarily lost Then the head began to reform as the speaker refocused his thoughts toward Bayalun and the barren steppes Speak quickly Khadun My time is short Do not order me JuHai Chou I am not one of your dogpeople the second empress snapped She reached for a small fan a gift from the Shou emperor to dispel the smoky form Most humble apologies wise one said the face with an expression of diplomatic regret The head tilted a little to bow toward her Please inform this simple servant why you have summoned him You did summon me Bayalun was accustomed to the mandarins impatience and paid it no attention Slowly the khadun smoothed her robes adjusting the jupon the overrobe so that it hung straight from her shoulders The Tuigan army is in Khazari This we know through our spies Is that all There was a trace of annoyance in the mandarins voice at being disturbed over such petty news The khahan lives The creature you sent failed Although the assassination attempt had been a near disaster she relished telling the Shou minister of state the news The images eyes widened in surprise then quickly became blank Is it alive or dead His words were quick and clipped Dead Do they suspect Me Eke Bayalun asked knowing full well that was not what the mandarin meant He couldnt care less about her troubles Of course they suspect The vaporous brows furrowed By that you mean your khahan suspects Shou Lung He does not just suspect Bayalun gloated He blames the emperor of the Jade Throne himself Your little assassin was too obvious and easy to identifyonce he was dead A priest of the Khazari knew quite a bit about your hu hsien A Khazari priest the image ruminated the words echoing around the small yurt Who An envoy of Prince Ogandi But that does not matter Bayalun knew perfectly well the mandarin was eager to know more She relished goading the Shou bureaucrat with these petty secrets It kept him offbalance Know this she continued before the mandarin could protest or probe further The khahan blames your Son of Heaven and is marching with his army to conquer all of Shou The face smiled parts of its cheeks drifting away The smoky shape was slowly becoming smaller leaner He is more foolish than we thought We will easily brush him away like a small insect He cannot break the Dragonwall The trace of panic and puzzlement that had been in the voice was gone replaced by confidence Perhaps countered Bayalun By the time he reaches the Dragonwall he will have two hundred thousand warriors The cloud snorted a puff of smoke in contempt He might also have magical aid Mother Bayalun stated slowly She deliberately picked up the fan and gently waved it to cool her face The image wavered and spread pushed back by the gentle breeze A smoky eyebrow raised Unless it hissed picking up the beat of her words I have kept you too long from your duties the crafty woman said Perhaps you should return to your emperor The face barely repressed a grimace of frustration Perhaps I should have the Gorath come speak with you Bayalun blanched slightly at the mention of the Gorath a creature of great power rumored to be the emperors personal assassin The smoke of the mandarins face swirled and distorted breaking up in several different directions Threaten me JuHai Chou and I will end this alliance in blood Bayalun spat Threaten us the mandarin answered in a cooler but no more friendly tone and we will expose you There will always be another willing to aid us The image restored itself to form and glared down from the top of the tent Bayalun matched stare for stare stiffly getting to her feet so she didnt have to look so far upward One hand still clutched the fan Then we must work together she finally said Although a powerful sorceress Bayalun knew that the mandarins threat was real just as he knew her threat was no idle boast Indeed agreed the voice What is it you now seek Your feeble assassin is what brought us to this disaster Now you must be ready to give more Yamuns throne you have already promisedbut now he goes to war with you Youll have to buy your peace First youll have to pay a tribute to get the khans to go home A bribe you mean Call it what you will And how do we get rid of your troublesome son the face asked Bayaluns magic was fading the back of the smokeformed head was trailing off into a cloud of winding tendrils Suddenly forms eyes rolled back again as the mandarins concentration weakened Bayalun spoke quickly before she lost contact entirely The khahan marches toward the Dragonwall There you will have to destroy him and his bodyguards I cannot do this now They are too suspicious of me It must be done by the armies of Shou Lung You can trap and destroy him with my aid There are those in his army who will help us A trap the mandarins voice echoed the face completely gone from sight meet again Xanghi River The spell was broken The vapor swirled out through the yurts smoke hole Vexed by her conversation Bayalun waited until all the trailing wisps faded away The heavy scent of incense still hung in the air Satisfied that all traces of her work had dissipated Bayalun gathered up her pouch of incense and set the brazier back in its proper spot Shuffling slowly to the door for these days she moved stiffer when no one was around she undid the ties and pulled the flap back Thrusting her head out into the afternoon sun she startled the guards who were standing at ease on either side of the door Send a runner for General Chanar Tell him the khadun would be most honored if he would attend her She coughed a bit and realized how raspy her voice was from the smokefilled tent While one guard went off to see that her orders were carried out Bayalun had the other bring out one of the small chests so she could sit in the sun Settling in comfortably she planted her staff between her feet and wrapped her hands around its gnarled wooden shaft The sunshine cut through the cool spring air and heated her tired aching body In a short time she closed her eyes and relaxed To passersby who might not know better Bayalun was just another matron dozing in the warm afternoon sun But she was not asleep A corner of her mind was still alert and attentive listening to the outside world But the rest of her mind wandered thinking back to other times more youthful days among her mothers people the Maraloi A series of footfalls brought Bayalun out of her dark reverie She stretched her neck struggling to clear her head Opening her eyes she saw Chanar waiting impatiently for her word I have come to do you honor he said pompously He did not kneel to the khadun but stood waiting for her to acknowledge his presence Bayalun looked up at him over the golden finial of her staff The generals arrogance was almost palpable but he still cut a handsome figure His braids were long and full and his mustache carefully trimmed Dressed in armor he looked the powerful warrior that he truly was one of the seven valiant men Help me up she said although it sounded more like a command Chanar easily hoisted Bayalun to her feet The general followed her into the yurt and reached for her waist as soon as the flap closed Gently she slid out of his grasp and blocked him with her staff Do you still have the desire Chanars eyes gleamed lustfully To take the power that should be yours the khadun concluded He stopped where he was somewhat taken aback by her question To become khahan you mean Of course Her light smile mocked him What else Chanar turned away hands clasped behind his back arrogance and desire rising up to face what remained of his loyalty Beforewhen we spokeit was Who could save the empire if the khahan died You spoke of things that could happen might happen even hinted that you saw something with your arts I believed you Chanar turned back toward her his face graven with a look of betrayal But then the khahan shows this thing that attacked him I knew you werent speculating then You did that You sent a beast not even man Not even Yamun should die like that You wanted to kill Yamun but you failed And now you want to try againand drag me into it Bayalun cocked her head as Chanar spoke watching him through gradually narrowing slits So thats it she said in a soft monotone your courage leaves you when your hand must hold the reins You are willing to let me do your work No wonder youre such a fine generalordering others to their deaths Chanar reddened in anger and embarrassment and his voice rose to a snarling hiss Thats not true Im braver than any man Youre changing my words Its just that now I see you want me to be your assassin Foolish man If I wanted a killer I could find one who would not have doubts Bayalun said as she lightly dismissed his rage She put her hand on his chest I do not want a killer I come to you because I see that you are a leader And I thought I saw a man but you are afraid to even hear what I have to say Chanar gritted his teeth biting back the rage Yamun is my anda he spat Bayalun sprang upon his words like a hawk striking the trainers lure Her jaw trembled as she circled round him Has he treated you like his anda she goaded Do you drink his kumiss No a little bald foreigner does that for you The priest sits at his councils not you His wetnosed sons lead his Kashik in battle Others mock you behind your back Eyes flashing as the huntress in her closed for the kill the widow pressed close to Chanars side and continued whispering in his ear Ive heard them when the khahan sits with the other khans Ive heard them talk of you Fool evil dog lazy mulethose are things they say Then they laugh around the fire and drink more kumiss Perhaps they are right I offer you the throne of the Tuigan and you will not take it Bayalun you have your reasons to see him gone If not me youd turn to another for help Chanar accused Of course I have my reasons and I will turn to anyone who can help me came the unhesitating reply There was no shame in the widows voice only a bitter undertone of hatred I think of my son I think of my husbandmy true husband not this murderer I was forced to marry I have not forgotten them I have the right she snapped And dont you have your reasons Yamun will lead us all to destruction battering our armies against the Dragonwall of Shou Lung Perhaps the priest suggested this as a way to destroy us all So what will you do The second empress took a step backward as she waited for Chanars answer He stood there quietly his chest heaving fingers slowly unknotting behind his back The color that had drained from his face was gradually returning The wind blew against the yurt creaking the wickerwork sides The door flap snapped against its wooden frame Chanar tilted his head back looking toward the smoke hole His lips moved saying a silent prayer Finally he lowered his head and looked the confident Bayalun straight in the eyes almost as if he were trying to fathom the depths of her dark nature She didnt flinch from his gaze but met it straight on Defiant selfassured savagethese qualities Chanar saw within the glistening blackness of her eyes The general blinked breaking away from her hypnotic gaze He had made his decision Carefully Chanar pulled his long curved saber from its scabbard letting the weak sunlight that came through the smoke hole play over the blade With a defiant thrust he jammed it into the carpeting between them Bayalun gently touched the blade with her staff Tell me what I have to do he demanded grimly For now come with me Bayalun answered gently the coldness melting away from her now that she had triumphed Bayalun took Chanars hand and gently pulled him toward the back half of the tent There will be time for talk later Koja stumbled through the gloom exhausted He had been sitting all day in negotiations with the diplomats of his old lord Prince Ogandi He could only see it that way nowPrince Ogandi was the man he once served what seemed to be centuries ago This meeting had confirmed Kojas separation from his own people He could vividly see the look of outrage and fury on the faces of the Khazari diplomats when he was presented as the khahans representative His title certainly hadnt helped the negotiations any The priest desperately wanted to go to bed and forget this awful day Emotionally it had been hideous perhaps worse in its own way than the terror he had experienced on the battlefield During the mad charge across the plain excitement and fear had kept him detached and allowed him to witness the blood and suffering without any emotional response He wasnt even aware during the battle of how scared he was That realization only came later In the tent with the Khazari however Koja felt every excruciating second Their hatred for him seemed much stronger expressed in Khazari He understood every nuance and connotation of their words There was little he could do at the time but suffer through it while demanding their acceptance of the khahans terms Now he had to tell Yamun the days results Reaching Yamuns yurt the lama leaned against the doorframe while a servant announced him It was not proper or decorous but Koja didnt care He was tired The servant came back and ushered the lama in The khahan was alone enjoying a late dinner of boiled horsemeat and curd porridge chomping noisily on the simple food He looked up from his meal and nodded for Koja to take a seat Finishing the mouthful Yamun wiped his face on the silken sleeve of his robe leaving a greasy swipe on the fine blue fabric Welcome priest Will you eat Koja nodded although he wasnt hungry especially not for the unappetizing dishes set out in front of him One small advantage of being in Khazari was that he had found some proper food roasted barley and vegetables Still not wanting to insult the khahan he gingerly took a scrap of meat and a small bowl of the porridge Chewing broadly he made a great show of eating Neither man spoke during the meal Finally Yamun slurped down the last drops of the porridge and then wiped the bowl clean with his fingers He set it aside and waited for the priest to finish Koja wasted no time in pushing away his own meal barely touched Theyve accepted my terms for peace Yamun predicted scratching at the stubble of his thin beard Mostly corrected Koja They still have some reservations Yamun looked carefully at the priest Such as he asked a steely edge in his voice Of course they agree to surrender Koja hurriedly explained to avoid provoking the khahan They are only ambassadors and will have to go back and present your terms to Prince Ogandi However they find them generally acceptable What are their problems Yamun demanded cutting through Kojas stalling He gulped a ladleful of kumiss and waited for Koja to get to the point They want to negotiate the amount of tribute Haggling Yamun shouted in astonishment I offer them peace or destruction and they want to haggle about the price Im sure its only a formality Yamun Koja interrupted speaking as quickly as he could The Illustrious Emperor of All People snorted in disgust You said there were problems not just one The governor and his men are a problem too The ambassadors want to know if you intend to keep these men as hostages The demand for the Shou envoys has them concerned Koja rubbed his temples trying to make his rising headache go away My intentions are clear Im going to kill them It is this or total destruction Didnt you make this clear Yamun looked away in vexation Naturally I stressed it to them Koja assured the squat warlord They are confused Whys that Yamun scratched his head picking for a louse that had crawled out of his hat Koja discreetly chose not to notice the khahans preening Taking Khazari hostages they understand but they dont see why you want the men from Shou Lung They are afraid this will make the Shou emperor angry with them Yamun ignored the comment He set aside his kumiss and asked Does this governor have any use as a hostage The priest thought for a minute I think he is a cousin of the prince Good What about the other man the wizard who killed my men Koja hesitated He knew the man was no relation to Prince Ogandi but if he revealed that Yamun would certainly condemn the dong chang to death That would make him a priest of Furo responsible for the murder Still if he lied the khahan would learn the truth sooner or later and would kill the man anywayand Koja would be in trouble He is not related to anyone I know of Yamun Koja finally replied Then he must die The jagun of the men executed in Manass will want vengeance explained the khahan It is known the wizard still lives This is a great shame for their jagun and it will be worse if he is allowed to escape Therefore the wizard will be turned over to them for punishment Koja cringed He knew that the men of the jagun would not just kill the dong chang they would make the wizards death prolonged and agonizing The only argument to save the wizards life Koja could think of was that it was wrong but it wasnt wrong to Yamun For him it was the correct thing to do What of the governor the lama asked weakly Can I promise the Khazari that he will live Only if they also turn over the wizard and the men of Shou Yamun stressed Ill keep the princes cousin as hostage but the others will die Koja pondered the offer judging whether the Khazari would be likely to accept it It was clear from the meetings today that the Khazari were frightened by the power and savagery of the khahans men I think they will accept that the priest decided sadly He felt unclean He had managed to save the life of one man but only at the cost of the other three Yamun suddenly yawned I am tired now Koja and so are you It is time to rest Go now With a nod he dismissed the priest The audience over Koja returned to his yurt and quickly went to bed Already tired Yamuns yawn had seemed to drain him of his last energy reserves Ignoring the cold meal Hodj had laid out Koja went straight to bed At first exhausted though he was the priest could not sleep He kept thinking of the days events particularly the wizards fate Koja felt responsible for Yamuns decision Fretting and guiltridden he fell into an uneasy slumber A noise penetrated the gray fog enclosing the priest It was the grinding clink of stone against stone He was outside still dressed in his sleeping robes The wind was blowing but he did not feel the cold Looking around Koja could see that it was still night somewhere on a grassy plainor what remained of it The ground was a jumble of cracks and upheaved earth Bodies of warriors and horses lay halfburied halfcrushed under the churned ground Some were Tuigan bodies clearly identified by the war banners flapping spectrally in the wind Mingled among the troopers were the bodies of other warriors dressed in antique armors Koja could recognize only a few A man here wore the garb of a Kalmyr chieftain like one the priest had seen on an ancient scroll Another wore the outlandish armor of a Susen warrior easily identified by the flaring earpieces on the battered helm The bodies encased by the armors were dried husks their mummified skin stretched tight over the bone The odd noise came from up ahead Koja clambered over the mounds of dirt past the skeletal warriors and broken lances Reaching the top of the largest mound he could see a dark shape a wall of immense size To the left and right it stretched beyond his vision It stood higher than the fivestoried palace of Prince Ogandi in Skardu At the top was a line of battlements jutting upward like broken teeth The hammering sound came from its base As he drew closer Koja saw a line of men futilely battering the walls foundation with mauls Like the dead of the broken land behind Koja these men were dressed in a weird assortment of ancient clothes There were soldiers from Kalmyr Susen Pazruki and men from lands he could not identify from their garb Each man swung his maul at a single spot a single stone oblivious to those around him The ground reverberated with their blows but no swing left any mark on the fortification Fascinated Koja walked down the line invisible to the toilers He passed by a Kalmyri then stopped to study the man It was Hunkho the great war chief of Kalmyr Centuries ago Hunkho had driven the Shou out of the wasteland back behind the Dragonwall only to be stopped by the Shou construction Koja recognized him from the history texts in the temple The dead warlord continued his monotonous task Koja resumed his walk Farther on was the infamous Toyghla of the Susen a conqueror in his own right He too never faltered from his work on the wall Finally Koja saw an end to the line and a lone robed figure apart from the others This man held a hammer but did not swing it at the Dragonwall Compelled by curiosity the lama ran forward When he reached the man Koja put a hand on the masons shoulder The figure turned revealing the face of his old master horribly shriveled and gaunt Smiling the master handed Koja the hammer This is the wall you have chosen Break it and be free the old man intoned Seizing the sledge Koja watched as the old master faded before his eyes Suddenly he was alone with a line of warlords Automatically Koja swung the maul The stone splintered splitting the smooth surface of the wall Koja looked at the crack Something glittered and slid inside it He swung again and the crack widened A shape softly ground against the ragged edges of the stone The line of warlords stopped turning in dumb astonishment The lama peered into the crack Something moved inside the Dragonwall something huge and scaled Free me it whispered the tones musically floating out through the hole Free me Koja of Khazari Koja swung the maul A painful shock ran through his hands as the sledge hit stone Chips flew but the crack was no larger He swung again and again jolting with each blow The priests breath came in ragged pants His sweaty hands grasped the mauls handle trying to keep it from slipping away He pounded frantically desperate to widen the crack Finally Koja stopped exhausted Looking up he saw the crack was unchanged unbroken It was no wider than it was when he started There were no chips or scratches in its surface Frustrated he slumped down at the foot of the wall the spirit drained out of him You alone cannot free me Koja of Khazari any more than these others who have tried and failed Lit by a faint glow the warlords returned to their task Who are you Koja gasped to the mysterious voice I am Lord Chien master of the ocean the voice said haughtily I am the Dragonwall Why cant I free you Koja asked as he clambered to his feet I await your lord Together you will have the might to humble my captors Dark scales slid past the crack in the wall then a baleful eye yellow and catlike came into view Guide him the strange voice continued Bring your lord to me and together you will free me Why do you call me Koja demanded as he stared at the huge eye You are his man He listens to you The others here know the price of failure They are doomed to stay tormenting me until the wall is no more Koja looked at the toiling lords and shuddered And if I do these things the lama asked backing away from the crack Then I will have my revenge roared the voice The ground shook with the spirits words then the eye disappeared from view Shaking Koja turned There was his master again strong and healthy once more The old man gently took the maul from Kojas grasp The lama knew it was time for him to leave Instinctively he headed back the way he had come past the conquerors and over the lands of the dead Just as he reached the hills top his master called out faintly Everything is in balance apprentice Change one thing and you will destroy something else There are walls all around you Choose carefully the ones you will destroy The words echoing around him Koja walked back into his yurt into his bed Blinking Koja sat up in the neardarkness of his yurt The events of his dream remained clear in his mind Without knowing quite why the lama hastily dug out his writing supplies Huddled close to the light of a glowing brazier Koja began to set down every detail Dreams and Destinies On the next few days the armys energies were consumed in its preparations to once again go on the march When the khahan had attacked Khazari Koja had marveled at the flow of orders given now he was absolutely stunned Forty thousand perhaps even fifty thousand men had taken part in the trek to Manass and even then only ten thousand had actually attacked the city The rest were stationed at points along the border partly to provide a threat to the Khazari but more to ease the problems of finding food and water for tens of thousands of men and horses Now arrangements were being made for an even grander campaign As historian Koja discharged his duty conscientiously he listened all he could and noted everything carefully in a growing pile of papers Yamun for his part organized his troops while waiting for the arrival of more men Messengers were coming with greater frequency from Hubadai in Semphar These reports were taken directly to the khahan Other riders wearing the stained yellow robes of Tomkes men also arrived with their letter pouches bulging From different sources Koja knew that there were one hundred and fifty thousand troopers converging on Yamuns camp The priest guessed that there would be about two hundred thousand men in the army by the time it reached Shou Lung Fifty thousand men were already a burden on the land two hundred thousand men would break it Already the stocks of grain and grass in this region were low because the army had not moved for so many days In his tent the khahan drew up plans to move the horsemen to new pastures and lay in supplies for the coming campaign To do this Yamun appointed more yurtchis and charged them with the responsibility of gathering supplies These officials set about their task with swift efficiency Each day the priest watched another group of bluerobed horsemen their faces caked in brown dust return with a herd of lowing cattle adding the beasts to the growing pastures of cattle and sheep Other jaguns triumphantly galloped past the tents leading in fine stallions and mares These prizes would become the extra steeds that would be needed for the upcoming battles Trains of oxcarts lumbered in with more goodsbags of millet and barley sacks of flour bales of rice barrels of wine urns of soy and bricks of tea salt and sugar The yurtchis sitting at a makeshift table diligently counted in all these provisions making tally marks on long strips of paper All these things Koja noted in his papers as he sat in the doorway to his tent sipping a cup of tea Hodj had prepared There were so many details that he could only note them briefly Finally he had to stop before he ran out of paper Carefully Koja packed away his writing materials and stood to leave He still had to inform Yamun of that days negotiations with the Khazari The lama carefully dusted off and adjusted the skirts of his black kalat the uniform of a nightguard It was a gift the Kashik insisted he wear though he was uncomfortable in the dress of a warrior the priest was not about to insult the generosity and honor of a few thousand tough soldiers The story of how the priest had saved Yamuns life came out after the couralitai and spread to the guards In recognition of his deed they more or less adopted him into their ranks He was now an honorary Kashik and so had to dress the part As the lama left the tent the arban assigned to be his bodyguard hurried to catch up What had normally been a lonely hike to the khahans tent was now quickly becoming a minor procession Today the khahan was holding his court outside He wore a light shirt of overlapping metal scales that covered his chest and a pair of heavy blue woolen trousers that disappeared into the loose tops of his boots Seeing Koja coming Yamun dismissed his aides and messengers Rising the warlord strode forward and grabbed the little man in a mighty hug Anda he said warmly stepping back to view Kojas new garb Im glad to see you The clothes fit you well Come and sit Koja could see that the khahan was in a particularly fine mood The priest waited for tea and kumiss to be served before speaking as was proper Finally the drinks were passed Setting his cup down Koja began Your tea is excellent Yamun The khahan did not acknowledge the compliment Have the Khazari surrendered anda he asked casually They have agreed to all your terms including the dong chang and the Shou ambassadors There is only one question they ask Koja guardedly said The envoys wish to know who will rule Manass once they surrender Will Prince Ogandi still have command Yamun clapped his hands in satisfaction Ive considered your words about ruling the country priest Ive decided to put Jad in charge of Khazari Hell make sure they keep the peace Besides he is my son He should rule This is a wise choice Yamun Koja was pleased Apparently he was having some effect on Yamuns policies The two drank their kumiss and tea for a little while longer Finally Koja spoke again Yamun what do you know of Shou Lung Many things anda You dont think Im ignorant do you Yamun reached out and refilled his ladle while watching the priests reaction Shou Lung has an emperor and it is a large country with much wealth so much that this emperor sends me gifts of great value and princesses of his own blood But what of their army their defenses their land Koja pressed Do you really know how big Shou Lung is Their army is mostly foot soldiers They carry machines that shoot arrows Crossbows Koja explained Their soldiers are slow and cant keep up with riders They have some horsemen but Shou cavalry has never been very good Even in my fathers time they rode beyond their borders to punish us for raiding They never had much luck on these trips So to protect themselves they keep a wall around their land These things every khan knows Yamun presented it all rather matteroffactly as if none of it affected him at all Yamun the Shou are a numerous people with warriors many times what the Tuigan have They have many cities much larger than Manass Cities are traps for soldiers easy to capture Yamun stretched lazily But there is the Dragonwall countered Koja Ah yes this is the wall they built around their lands Yamun commented Not all their lands Great Lord Koja corrected Only along the border with what they call the Plain of Horsesyour lands the steppe Then they are afraid of us The thought made Yamun even more confident Do you know how long the Dragonwall is the priest asked in exasperation It runs for hundreds of milesthousands of miles The khahan was unimpressed There is a story that tells how it was built Koja went on Perhaps if the khahan knew how the wall was made he would understand the power of Shou Lung So now you are a storyteller too the khahan said indulgently He poured out another ladleful of kumiss Very well tell your tale Koja sighed sensing that Yamun was not going to be swayed Nonetheless the priest untucked his legs and began The Dragonwall is very old but it has not been there forever They say that long ago warriors used to ride out of the Plain of Horses and raid the lands of Shou Lung In those days the Shou army could not stop these riders Each year the raiders took many horses and cattle Koja paused to sip at his tea At that time a wise emperor ruled Shou Lung When he saw what the riders did and that his army could not stop them he went to his advisor a powerful wizard and asked him How can I stop these riders Yamun yawned and waved for the lama to hurry along The priest spoke more quickly The wizard told the emperor of a dragon khan who lived beneath the oceana lake so wide you could not see across it The wizard said Trick the dragon out of the ocean and tell him to go to the west There I will meet him and we will stop the invaders Wizards Yamun snorted What am I supposed to learn from this anda Please Lord Yamun let me finish Koja sighed and then took up the story again So the emperor went out in a boat and rowed to the center of the ocean He stirred up the water with a big stick churning the mud up from the bottom Then the dragon khan came out of the water Who has disturbed me cried the dragon Koja resisted giving the dragon a deep booming voice though that is how he imagined the creature would sound The emperor pointed to the west The one who disturbed you ran far away to a land where there is no ocean If you hurry you can catch him So the dragon flew into the sky to chase the offender Koja paused to catch his breath A pretty story anda but whats the point Yamun asked impatiently Well the dragon flew to the edge of the Plain of Horses There it saw the wizard standing on the top of a mountain Are you the manthing who disturbed my peace it shouted out The wizard did not answer Instead he uttered a word The dragon fell from the sky Its huge coils crashed for hundreds of miles across the ridges of the land The ground shook and the body of the dragon turned into the brick and stone of the Dragonwall All from the power of a single word of a wizard and ever since no one has broken through the Dragonwall Koja waited for Yamuns reaction The khahan rose from his seat and stretched He looked to the sky In the distance the mountains were dull bluegray fading up to shimmering white peaks A few storm clouds hung low on the far horizon Turning back to Koja Yamun said evenly but forcefully You claim that the Dragonwall is more powerful than me You forget I am the khahan I can stand in the heart of Teylass lightning and not get hurt Ill break the Dragonwall It is the will of Teylas Yamuns words reminded Koja of the most fanatical priests of the Red Mountain Temple men who could not be reasoned with at all The lama sat silent while Yamun paced back and forth The sunlight glinted off the khahans metal shirt sending sparkling rays in myriad directions Finally Koja asked What will you do when you get to the Dragonwall I will smash it like a giant hammer Yamun boasted without a trace of doubt in his voice A day later the Khazari accepted the khahans terms of surrender Yamun met with the ambassadors for the first time and swore an oath to Teylas with them and formally set forth the terms of their capitulation All through the brief ceremony the representatives of Prince Ogandi shot hateful glares at the Khazari priest who sat among their enemies The wizard Yamun had demanded be handed over presented a problem someone had warned him of his fate and he managed to escape Although he was displeased the khahan modified the terms so that the sorcerer was named as an outlaw and the oathtaking continued At the end of the ceremony after the exgovernor of Manass was surrendered to the Kashik Yamun summoned his son Jad and gave him command over the Khazari The prince was presented as the new governor of Manass From that point on all judgments concerning Khazari were to pass through his hands A single tumen more than enough warriors to keep the peace the khahan pointed out was detached and placed under Jads command The next morning Yamuns army broke camp and began the march to Shou Lung For six days the troopers rode northeast heading for the First Pass Under Heaven the gateway to the broad lands of Shou Lung Even in early spring the ground here was dry the land they traveled marked the very fringe of a cold desert Compared to their previous trek Koja found the pace of this journey almost casual leisurely As the army moved it collected more tumens first the forces strung along the Khazari frontier and then a huge contingent that rode in from the west The slow march was intentional giving the army time to swell in size At the start of the march there were about fifty thousand warriors By the dawn of the sixth day Koja estimated there were two hundred thousand men snaking along the trail toward the Dragonwall It was late in the afternoon of that sixth day when Koja saw the khahans banner finally reach the top of the First Pass Under Heaven The yurtchis responsible for the days march met the khahan there and after presenting themselves explained what their scouts found Koja was too far away to hear them but his eyes followed their sweeping gestures as they pointed down toward the plain that spread out from the base of the mountains From the top of the still snowcovered pass the plain appeared to be nothing but a smooth expanse of green and brown broken only occasionally by the darker cuts of gullies and streams From so far away in this realm of rock and ice it looked like a promised land though it was nothing but grassland sparsely dotted with stands of trees In the distance the smooth ground gave way to rugged terrain The horizon rose and fell several times hinting at the chance of more mountains somewhere beyond The dark line of what seemed to be a ravine crookedly traversed the scene far out on the plain the yurtchis were pointing at it with some excitement Studying it closely Koja realized that it was the shadow of the Dragonwall Fascinated Koja traced it with his finger The wall rose fell twisted curved and disappeared from sight only to reappear farther away This is what Yamun proposes to attack with men alone the priest thought sadly He was suddenly certain that the task was hopeless whether Yamun had fifty thousand or five hundred thousand warriors The khahan had no heavy equipmenttowers catapults and ramsneeded for a siege He had no way to break the masonry wall Whatever protective magic the wall might possess only made matters worse The shouted commands of the Kashik officers roused Koja out of his reverie as the horde started moving again Carefully the priest picked his way down the darkening eastern slope toward the campsites chosen by the yurtchis leaving behind the First Pass Under Heaven Chanar was not sleeping well For the past several nights there had been dreams dreams he couldnt remember but knew were somehow disturbing Another had just passed so forceful that he tossed and turned nearly awake Just then the door flap to his yurt which wasnt really his opened by itself The slight motion was enough to bring him to consciousness The generals hand darted to his sword carefully laid beside his bed Glaring through the open door he could not see any sign of an intruder Just as he was about to rise and investigate the flap closed again by itself There was a quick shimmer and suddenly Bayalun dressed in a dark fur cloak was kneeling by the doorway fastening down the ties She quickly looked up and pressed her fingers to her lips silencing Chanar before he could even react to her sudden appearance Quiet Bayalun quickly whispered crossing to his side Prepare to leave Chanar looked at her and blinked as his sleepchoked mind tried to sort out what was happening Clumsily he groped for her thinking she came to join him at his bed Fiercely Bayalun pushed aside his advances and jabbed him in the side with her staff Get up she hissed sharply clearly not in the mood for romance Startled as much by the pain as the widows ferocity Chanar sat straight up ruefully rubbing his side Awake the general looked at the khadun his eyes clearer and his mind starting to function Whats going on We must go somewhere tonightnow she said with passionate urgency Get your robes on Are we under attack Whats going on Chanar demanded making no effort to keep quiet as he scrambled out from under the blankets Quiet she ordered We must go to a meeting you and I A meeting with the Shou Bayalun walked to the tent door preparing to leave Chanar pulled on his trousers and boots feeling an unaccountable sense of dread Where he asked Just come with me The woman didnt wait to explain more but stooped to undo the door fastenings Chanar hastily pulled on his mail shirt and grabbed the sword and belt nearby buckling them on as Bayalun peeked out through the opening Keep quiet she instructed We dont want the guards to see us leave Chanar shrugged trying to get his armor to settle into place Why dont you cast a spell like you did when you came Too risky You do not know how to move invisibly Youll trip over your own feet That will certainly attract attention Chanar started to rebuke Bayalun but she slipped out through the door before he could get a word out Angrily clapping his mouth shut Chanar followed her into the camp The moon was waning casting a faint light over the camp With the brilliance of Anjar dimmed the sparkling points of the Nine Old Men the stars that trailed behind the moon showed brightly Chanar and Bayalun carefully picked their way through the small cluster of tents in the royal compound They stopped short once narrowly avoiding the notice of a Kashik guard who was relieving himself just beyond the confines of the khahans ground Once outside Yamuns camp the two moved much more quickly Hosts of men lay stretched out on the ground wrapped in thick blankets sound asleep Horses on long tethers wandered among the dozing soldiers A few men hastened to and fro since the business of the camp never really stopped Picking their way past the clumps of sleeping men the conspirators took an hour to reach the edge of the camp but no sentry challenged them along the way Bayalun softly released a sigh of tension thankful for avoiding discovery Quickly This way she whispered pulling Chanar toward a ravine that cut across a nearby slope Bayalun set off at a brisk pace adroitly avoiding stones and clumps Chanar could barely see Behind her Chanar cursed under his breath as he stumbled to keep up Bayalun was even more surprised than Chanar when a shadowy shape rose in front of them At first she thought it was a Shou soldier sent to escort them Then the figure spoke Stop the shape commanded speaking perfect Tuigan Bayalun jolted to a halt Chanar almost crashing into her A sentry she hissed under her breath Quickly speak to him She pulled Chanar ahead of her Im Chanar Khan Do you challenge me the general demanded Advance and name yourself Behind the general Bayalun slipped off to the left disappearing into the darkness The sentry came forward cautiously his sword drawn until he was close enough to recognize Chanars clothes The man was only a common trooper Flustered and nervous in the presence of a khan the sentry finally remembered his place and dropped to one knee bowing his head Do not be angry Chanar Khan he stammered I was only following the instructions of my commander Good work soldier What lies beyond Chanar was at a loss for what he was supposed to do now Bayalun left him stranded there and he was beginning to think that shed used him for a fool General this leads Suddenly a black shape sprang out of the darkness onto the sentrys back The attacker struck with a knife The guard gave a muffled bubbling gasp The two bodies crashed to the ground Chanar sprang back drawing his saber ready to strike The bodies thrashed about and then the guard stopped moving Help me up commanded Bayalun from on top of the sentry Chanar started then recognized the black shape as the second empress He was amazed she could move so quickly and with such strength Chanar pulled her up Her hands were warm and slippery Panting from the exertion the khadun leaned against the general to catch her breath The sentrys blood dripped from her fingers onto Chanars gleaming mail Help me find my staff she said weakly You killed him Chanar said still disbelieving the speed with which she had struck He found Bayaluns staff and handed it to her He saw us Now drag his body into that ravine out of sight Bayalun commanded pointing ahead into the darkness Startled into motion the general grabbed the dead mans heels and pulled the body facedown through the dirt leaving a trail of blood behind There was a thud and then a clatter of rocks as the body slid down the slope into the gully Rubbing the blood off his hands with a fistful of dust Chanar stood at the top of the gully He was looking into the thick shadows when Bayalun joined him This is a bad omen Chanar cursed as they wound their way along the bottom of the gully He fumed quietly The guards deathll be noticed Its certain to betray us Listen Bayalun said her fiery spirit rising theyll think the Shou did it No one knows we are here Chanars tension eased seeing the wisdom of her words Its too bad that man had to die he finally allowed but it was his fate Bayalun said nothing carefully picking her way through the stones The tumbled slopes of the ravine widened creating a small level circle of ground free of broken rocks The weak moonlight cast a dim radiance at the center of the clearing leaving heavy dark shadows along the edges Bayalun stopped in one of these shadows holding Chanar close alongside her He could tell the second empress was excited she trembled slightly and her breath came in rapid gasps They stood still waiting The air was chill threatening to leave a heavy frost Chanar thrust his hands into the wide sleeves of his robes to keep them warm and shifted uneasily trying to maintain his patience A whispery voice sounded from the deep shadow on the other side of the clearing Welcome Second Empress Eke Bayalun of the Enough greetings the widow interrupted with a sharp thump of her staff Ive come Is JuHai Chou here I speak for the Minister of State answered the shadow speaking with the shaky voice of an old man Then know that if JuHai Chou seeks our help to destroy the khahan of the Tuigan he must come himself We do not deal with kharachu Bayalun noted angrily Chanar doubted the speaker on the other side knew hed just been called a slave by the khadun The second empress and her general seek our help to gain the throne of the Tuigan She will talk to whomever JuHai Chou sends the voice whispered back in icy tones Although softly spoken the words were clear Bayaluns first demand had failed and she now considered her next course of action JuHai Chous representative is acceptable she conceded abruptly changing to a gentler tone We will stay JuHai Chou will be greatly honored the voice said politely Listen then Bayalun began once more seizing the initiative Soon the khahan will ride against the Dragonwall Perhaps your wall is strong but he might break through Unthinkable the old mans voice replied in utter confidence Perhaps but he is wily and has many men The unthinkable might happenespecially if the wizards were to help him Their help will make no difference No one can break the might of the Dragonwall it is made of more than simple brick and mortar the voice boasted Do you think your khahan is the first to crash himself against it Other armies have tried and failed Bayalun raised her eyebrow in interest as she listened The Shou hinted at secrets concerning the wall she did not know Choosing her words carefully she tried to goad him into revealing more Secrets can always be discovered the khadun suggested ominously thumping her staff again for emphasis There was a sharp hiss from the other side of the ravine The meaning of her words was not lost on the speaker You know the Shou snarled I have many sources kharachu Bayalun lied She knew nothing of the wall except what the Shou had let slip Still she paused to let the man worry Even if the khahan cannot break through he will forever raid your caravans and strangle your trade with the western lands All you can do is hide behind your wall until he goes away You must get rid of him The second empress has some plan whispered the voice somewhat rankled by her observations Indeed The armies of Shou Lung will destroy the khahan and his bodyguards What will you do while we risk all the speaker snapped We will aid you but we cannot act so directly We cannot be suspected or the throne will fall to one of the khahans sons If that happens nothing will be gained Bayalun explained patiently You must attack the khahan Very well I will the hidden speaker across the clearing agreed What is your plan You will bring your army out of the Dragonwall and defeat the khahan In the battle he will be killed That is all the voice asked sarcastically And how are we to defeat him Chanar explain the khahans plans Bayalun commanded seating herself on a rock Chanar stepped forward standing on the edge of the light Yamun Khahan will bring part of his army in front of the Dragonwall He will attack with this group and then seem to retreat in great confusion Weve done this many times explained the general You must not pursue him Its a trap When you dont follow hell return to attack again Thats when you must be ready to charge He outnumbers the troops well have available To attack then will be suicide whispered the Shou speaker Only if you attack alone countered Chanar and you wont Send your army out onto the plain in front of the wall The khahan wont be able to resist He will charge When he does break to your flanks and let him pass through toward the wall My men will fall upon him from the rear and you can strike from the sides Trapped between the wall and our men hell be destroyed And you will become khahan the voice concluded with a trace of sarcasm And if the tribute is paid to the khans there will be peace between the Tuigan and Shou Lung Bayalun pointed out The bribe will be paid I will tell JuHai Chou of your plan You will not hear from us again until after the battle the voice said flatly There was a scraping noise from the shadows as the stranger prepared to leave Bayalun called out Hold one moment speaker for JuHai Chou A request What Send us one of your men to be a runner in case we need to communicate Cant you use spells inquired the Shou The runner will be an extra precaution should I be unable to use my spells Give us a man We have clothes ready for him at the edge of our camp Chanar looked at Bayalun knowing full well theyd made no such preparations She met his gaze sharply warning him to keep quiet It is agreed There was a pause then a small man stepped out of the shadows He wore the dress of a common soldier of Shoua long padded coat stitched with quilted squares slipperlike shoes and a simple metal cap The runner carried a spear and a sword hung in a scabbard at his side In the darkness the colors of his clothes were impossible to see Nervously the man barely more than a youth moved across the clearing Success to the second empress and the illustrious general said the shadowed figure across the ravine Indeed Chanar Bayalun whispered very softly be watchful and ready to use your sword on my signal She tilted her head slightly toward the Shou soldier Quickly now we must be back before it grows too light she said in broken Shou her voice loud enough that the warrior could hear her The three set out following the trail back to the camp Bayalun took the lead then came the Shou warrior while Chanar brought up the rear They wound their way along the ravine until they reached the spot where Chanar had hidden the sentrys body Now said Mother Bayalun without turning around Chanar instantly took the cue and before the unfortunate soldier could react the generals sword bit into the mans neck just below the ear There was a soft snap as the blade sheared bone The guards severed head went tumbling down the slope There was a quick jet of blood then legs and arms still flailing the body toppled to the ground Chanar wiped his blade on the dead mans sleeve then tore off a piece of the cloth to wipe his mail shirt clean He retrieved the head and set it closer to the sentry Bayalun had killed earlier Good Leave the body where it is the khadun said from the top of the ravine When the guards find the bodies in the morning theyll decide the sentry was attacked by Shou enemies No one will suspect us Now we must get back into camp The Dragonwall The excited jabber of mens voices echoed throughout the royal compound just before sunrise even before dawn marked the horizon The noise interrupted Kojas bath What was normally a luxury though unappreciated by Hodj was today an icy ordeal The air was cold and the water was melted from the snows outside The commotion in the camp was a welcome excuse to get dressed Shivering Koja quickly pulled on his new black robes foregoing his normal careful inspection for vermin He couldnt see how the Tuigan could stand it liceridden as their clothes so often were Putting the thought aside he hastily pulled on the soft boots Hodj had found to replace his wornout slippers The priest made an incongruous figurea bald gaunt man hardly a warrior dressed in the rich black kalat of Yamuns elite bodyguard While Koja dressed the clamor outside continued Still fastening the toggles on his kalat the lama scrambled through the door into the predawn darkness A fire blazed nearby casting shadows of the men standing around it Two bodies lay on the ground next to the flames Koja hurried over to the groupseveral common troopers a few more of the Kashik and stooped old Goyuk What is it Goyuk Khan the priest asked Come and look the ancient warrior answered his wrinkled face marked by a grim frown Scowling Goyuk pointed at the bodies on the ground Pushing past the troopers Koja stopped in horror Spread on the ground were the corpses of two men One was a Tuigan trooper with the front of his kalat soaked in blood from a gaping slit in his throat The other was a strange warrior wearing a heavy quilted robe emblazoned with a single Shou character the word for virtue He wore the armor of a simple foot soldier The warriors head was carefully set next to the body Koja turned away Who is it he gasped to Goyuk The old man deferred to the Kashik commander standing beside him Master lama the Kashik explained politely although his voice was cold with anger This man was a soldier of the Naican ordu stationed on guard duty last night They found him this morning along with this other one He must have met a Shou patrol and they killed him At least he killed one of the enemy before he died It happened over there The commander pointed toward the northeast where the ground fell away toward the plain below Does Yamun know Koja asked of Goyuk The old man nodded sucking on his lower lip He sent me Koja looked at the bodies again There was something here that didnt seem right Why he finally asked almost to himself Why did Yamun send me Beca No no Koja quickly corrected Why were the Shou so close to the camp Did anything else happen Koja asked the officer Nothing was reported master lama the commander replied They were scouting us and this man found them Goyuk said with finality It is clear Hang the body of the Shou up Now there is work to be done Having voiced his opinion on the subject the old khan stomped away his armor jingling as he went The Kashik followed after him Still unsatisfied with this simple answer Koja knelt beside the dead trooper and gingerly examined the wound How often does a warrior in battle have his throat cut so neatly Koja asked turning to one of the guards who remained nearby The guard looked at him puzzled It is rare he admitted but one of the Shou might have attacked him from behind And he still chopped the head off another Koja asked skeptically It could happen insisted the man Perhaps Koja said though he was far from convinced The priest stood and the guards took the body of the dead enemy to hang out for display as Goyuk had instructed As they were dragging the corpse off Koja suddenly had an idea Leave the head and this man he ordered pointing to the trooper Wrap the bodies and keep them safe There were some questions Koja wanted to ask the dead men but first he had to rest and pray to Furo for guidance The men looked at him with horrified eyes shocked by his grotesque request Fearful of what they imagined were the priests awesome powers the guards gulped and carried out his orders His mind racing with speculation Koja went back to his tent to have his morning tea and say his daily prayers to Furo Hodj had already cleared away the bath and set out a pot of hot tea The drink warmed the priest driving away the predawn chill His tent provided only a brief haven from the commotion of the camp Outside the army was already beginning to array itself Eventually coming out of his yurt Koja took the horse his bodyguards held for him and rode to where Yamuns standard waved The dark line of the Dragonwall was clearly visible on the plain below Yamun his aides and the armys commanders were clustered around the banner debating strategies for the impending attack In addition to the khahan there were a few others Koja recognized Goyuk Chanar and the big brute Sechen The priest looked about for Bayalun but she was nowhere in sight There were others he only knew by passing acquaintance minor commanders of the Kashik Yamuns standardbearer and even his old withered scribe They formed an impressive group dressed in their battle armor Yamun wore his finest armor in anticipation of his victory The suit was made up of small metal plates each fashioned like the scale of a dragon gleaming gold Silks of bright yellow blue and red hung from the armor and a gorget of hammered steel circled Yamuns neck and upper shoulders The khahans red braids dangled from beneath the conical helm hung with silver chain mail and trimmed with the white fur of a winter wolf Long metal bracers of polished steel tooled with tigers and dragons locked in combat were strapped over the chain mail that covered his forearms In one hand the khahan held a silverhandled knout of three thongs A bowcase of greendyed wyvern leather hung at his side along with a gemencrusted scabbard The hilt that thrust out from the scabbard was plain and businesslike A round shield of hammered gold and silver hung on his back Yamuns horse a fine purewhite mare was as lavishly decorated fitted with halfbarding that matched the khahans armor The saddle had high arches at the front and back covered with plates of tooled silver patterned with coiling and twisting vines The saddle frame was covered with a cushion of thick red felt trimmed with bits of silver mirrors and golden tassels The bridle rein and straps across the horses croup and withers were completely covered by bosses of gold set with turquoise In the eastern sunlight both Yamun and his horse were dazzling Those around the khahan though not as lavishly dressed were no less splendid Each commander wore his best armor Horses were carefully groomed and prepared Koja was amazed hed never realized the khans brought such finery with them It was likely too that this was the first time he had seen them in clothing so clean Welcome Koja Yamun said to the priest Today well test the strength of this Dragonwall The khahan let his horsewhip dangle from his wrist as he pointed toward the squadrons of mounted men forming up on the slope below them The riders were advancing in separate columns lined out abreast of each other instead of the continuous stream they used when on the march The war standards of the minghans and tumens were unfurled to flutter in the breezestreamers of silk horsetails tinkling bells and flashing mirrors hung from cords The troopers carried their full war gear with them a long springy lance curved sword two powerful compact bows and a pair of quivers packed with arrows There were whole blocks of armored men but the majority wore the same clothes they had every day a heavilypadded kalat being their sole protection A few carried shields but most of the riders disdained these for the shields interfered with their ability to shoot a bow Finally the khahan joined the line of advance the khans following him Today was the final march on Shou Lung several hours out from the Dragonwall All through the ride the khans were strangely quiet Most rode in silence gathering their thoughts or held huddled conferences on horseback with their lieutenants Gradually as the group drew closer to the Dragonwall the khahan gave the commanders their final orders and dispatched them to their units By the time the Tuigan reached the last ridge before entering onto the plain there were only three warriors remaining among the messengers who surrounded Yamun Chanar in his brilliant silver armor who was to command the left toothless old Goyuk commander of the right and Sechen who was in charge of Yamuns personal bodyguards The khahan himself decided to command the center this day Koja sat on his horse slightly behind this group not wishing to interfere A messenger barely more than a boy wearing the white robes of the empresss guard rode up on a panting mare and made his obeisance to Yamun The khahan waved him to speak The shining daughter of heaven the second empress has sent me to tell you that she has summoned her sorcerers from across the land and they have taken their positions throughout the army The youth sniffed and wiped his runny nose on a dirty sleeve This is good Tell her to put the wizards under the command of the khans Yamun ordered The messenger nervously sat straight in his saddle The second empress has ordered me to say that she will keep them under her command The khans do not know the powers of the mages and will use them badly The boy sat terrified in his saddle ready to flinch at the slightest move from anyone Yamun who had already gone on to other business suddenly turned his attention back to the messenger She will do what I command he snapped The boy swallowed in terror even though his mouth was dry Chanar rode forward apparently trying to soothe the situation Lord Yamun he began formally perhaps Eke Bayalun is right Many of the khans do not like the wizards They would not use them well Perhaps we should let her command Yamun refused to consider the suggestion I dont trust her Shes filled with treachery We may need her wizards today Chanar warned nodding toward the Dragonwall You can always assign someone to see she carries out your orders correctly Is very late to argue Goyuk added trying to defuse this crisis before the real battle started Reluctantly Yamun let himself be persuaded There was no time left for debate and he believed that the wizards would not be important in the battle anyway Assign one arban of the Kashik to each wizard the khahan decided Send a jagun of the Kashik to Bayalun Go boy and tell her the men are for her protection After the courier had ridden off Yamun continued his instructions Tell the Kashik to kill any wizard even Bayalun if any treachery is attempted Turning to the priest Yamun then surprised Koja by asking Anda can your god let you see the future Initially flustered Koja quickly replied Sometimes Furo can grant such insight Then can he tell us the outcome of todays battle Yamun inquired tugging at his mustache Bayalun has not seen fit to bring any of her shamans along to provide the service Koja thought for a moment reviewing the spells Furo had granted him this day Perhaps not a perfect answer he finally ventured but Furo might grant some hint of the fortunes of this place I cannot promise any more Whatever just do it The khahan was not particularly interested in the technical aspects of Kojas spells He was only interested in the results I will need to be closer to the Dragonwall Just ahead over that ridge Yamun said with a nod Sechen escort him there and see that he is unharmed By your word it shall be done said the big man Sechen guided Koja and a band of his guards up the last yards of the broken slope until they reached an outcropping of brush There they found a shaded spot where Koja had a clear view of the wall They were less than a mile away from the great Shou fortification The Dragonwall stretched in a long unbroken line greater and more massive than it had appeared from the top of the pass The brick used to build it gave the wall a dull yellowbrown color Koja guessed it stood thirty feet high The top was toothed with crenellations A roadway ran the length of the top broad enough for a chariot to ride down At regular intervals about one mile apart stood square towers taller than the surrounding wall These were obviously watchtowers The trail from First Pass Under Heaven wound down from the heights to a massive gate set in the wall The doors themselves were fully as high as the wall while the towers were even higher These gatehouses smoothsurfaced and rectangular tapered toward the top Arrow loops barely visible on the lower levels were replaced by balconies as archers positions higher up An arching bridge stretched between the towers over the heavy wooden gate Briefly Koja considered telling Yamun that his spell revealed their situation was hopeless If the trick worked he could save untold lives Morally though he knew he must work the spell He could not presume to speak for Furo such an act would be blasphemy Besides he doubted his prediction could sway Yamuns resolve Bright flashes of light sparkled on the plain Theyve deployed outside the gate observed Sechen whose eyesight was much better than Kojas Now that it was pointed out the priest could see the men arranged in a long line The flashes must have been from their armor and weapons They know were here Work quickly historian Koja began a breathing exercise to calm his mind It took a long time but Sechen was too busy counting the standards of the enemy to notice Finally the priest produced a scroll he had made that morning It was covered with special prayers Holding it up to the east he read it aloud then carefully repeated this process to the other points of the compass Finished he closed his eyes and stood quite still his body unconsciously going completely rigid Sechen and the guards waited all afraid to say anything lest they disturb the spell At last his overtensed muscles sagged and relaxed and the priest staggered backward Blinking he opened his eyes and stared at the Dragonwall Furos power was filling his sight letting him see the great balance of all nature All things living and dead animal and mineral were filled with the force of the Enlightened One Some such as an ordinary rock contained only a little while othersmen of powerful will in particularglowed brightly with inner power By seeing these auras through the divine inspiration of Furo Koja hoped to read the harmony of the land and perhaps predict the battles outcome At that moment Koja saw that a prediction would not be difficult to make Before the priests eyes blazed the aura of the Dragonwall itself as blinding as the sun Its brilliance blotted out all other auras even that of the Shou army deployed on the plain The intensity was beyond anything Koja had experienced The priest was dumbstruck The aura shone from all the way underneath the foundations of the fortification to the topmost towers The burning fire stretched all along the length of the wall and in it Koja could barely make out a form a shape struggling as if against invisible bonds Painfully Koja forced himself to stare into the heart of this magical fire to discern what lay hidden in the wall A claw dug deep into the earth A ridge of spines reached to the topmost battlements A pattern of scales blended with the brick and stone Through it all Koja felt a power watching him wrathful and tortured at the same time Furo protect me he blurted in astonishment shattering the enchantment Suddenly the scene was gone Blinded Koja stumbled back groping his way down the slope Sechen leaped after him convinced the lama had gone mad The priest eluded his grasp Undaunted or unaware of the danger Koja increased his speed and excitement at the same time By the time he reached the bottom of the ridge his breath came in ragged gasps Eyesight returning the priest hobbled and bounded back to the khahans party Well what is it Yamun shouted The lamas obvious excitement was contagious infecting the khahan with a feeling of hope Whatve you learned Koja finally caught his breath How could he describe what he saw A power a spirit greater than anything he had ever imagined lay beneathno was part ofthe Dragonwall Great khahan Koja began his chest heaving the omens are not favorable A powerful spirit protects the wall I am certain it will not let you break through Yamun was taken back by the priests words Not having a reply he turned to Sechen who came running up behind What did you see Lord Yamun the wrestler said as he stumbled forward I saw the Shou army They know we are coming and have lined up to meet us How many Yamun probed leaning forward in his saddle Twenty maybe twentyfive standards Id guess one thousand men to a banner like our minghans Yamun settled back into his saddle Ive got sixty standards Well leave But Yamun You cannot break through Koja stepped up to the khahans horse Soaked in sweat the priest was frantic trying to get Yamun to understand You will Quiet Yamun roared We wont have to He pointed to a spur of the ridge that Koja had just crossed Chanar take your men to that ridge and hold them there Goyuk take one tumen and advance set the rest of your men to protect the northern flank Ill hold the center The two khans nodded in understanding Goyuk you must draw them out Charge them once then break and run Chanar your men must be ready to close the rear behind them separate them from their wall Ill be the anvil and you two will be the hammers Together we will break them Neither khan had any questions Their aides would settle on signals to be given with banner and drum signals that would allow them to attack in unison Goyuk and Chanar left to deploy their men It would be several hours before the troops were in position That was good Yamun thought since it would keep the Shou soldiers standing motionless in the sun for most of the day Heat and thirst would weaken them His own men would hardly notice such conditions Yamun turned to Koja who stood nearby dispirited and dejected Priest I want you to learn more about what you saw With that the khahan turned away to find some shade For him there was nothing more to do now but take a nap Leaving the khahan Chanar galloped down the valley to rejoin his command Purposefully he took a long route one that carried him past Bayaluns camp Arriving there he was greeted by a motley collection of wizardstall and lean fat and sweaty some clothed in finery others scabrous and filthy The khahans guards had yet to arrive Contemptuously Chanar made his way past Bayaluns lackeys to seek out the khadun herself He found her sitting in the warm sun disdaining the cooling shade She looked asleep but without opening her eyes she dismissed her servants Welcome Chanar Why do you visit me The general swung down from his saddle and squatted beside the khadun Quickly he explained Yamuns plans Hes giving us the chance Chanar urged knotting his hands into fists Tell the Shou weve changed the plan They must ride forward and then we will all attack Yamun We can pin him between us and destroy him today No We will do nothing of the kind Mother Bayalun answered coolly She pulled the red and blue shawl off her head letting her graying hair fall naturally to her shoulders Think Chanar think If you were the Shou general would you trust us She rose from her seat and walked to the door of her yurt Dont forget Yamun will have his guards all around me We will keep to the plan For now let us prove to Yamun we are loyal Chanar knew perfectly well that the khahan would never fully trust Bayalun She was right however Yamun could not maintain his vigilance forever Still it rankled him to see such an opportunity slip by Bayalun sensed his dissatisfaction These Shou warriors are no match for the Tuigan she suggested appealing to Chanars pride We would be foolish to trust them to defeat the khahan Today Chanar do what the khahan expects Tomorrow we will crush him and you will be khahan Four hours passed while the khahans forces moved into position During that time Yamun slept under a thorny tamarisk tree Koja sat in the shade of a rock meditating and seeking guidance from his god He hoped that Furo would grant him more knowledge of the spirit he had seen today As the last of the troops moved into position on the plain below a servant roused the khahan from his nap Yamun insisted Koja accompany him so the priest stopped his exercises and followed him back to the top of the ridge There they found a comfortable position where they could watch Goyuks attack Sechen stood nearby ready with their horses Below on the plain was the one tumen Goyuk had chosen to make the initial charge The old khan had divided the ten thousand men into three large blocks Each block was ten riders deep and about three hundred men wide The right wing was deployed along the base of the ridge where Koja and Yamun sat The rest of Goyuks force stretched off to the left The priest spotted the old khans banner a pole with streamers of blue silk topped by a silver crescent in the gap between the nearest wing and the center Across the plain stood the soldiers of Shou Lung waiting in the broiling afternoon sun A rapid roll of drums signaled that all was ready on the plain Lance tips wavered creating a sparkling sea of lights Yamun waved his hand and his standardbearer dipped the yaktail banner to the ground The signal had been given The war began Koja watched fearful and expectant waiting for Goyuk to act The crescent moon banner trembled then dipped In a wave spreading out from that one point the banners of the minghans dropped transmitting the signal down the length of the front The ranks of horsemen trembled but did not move A sound rose up from the plain at first like the breeze through aspens The sound grew stronger until it echoed like the roar of a thunderstorm Ten thousand voices were raised in a harsh piercing war cry It reverberated until it seemed that the hills themselves were screaming for the blood of Shou Lung Goyuks banner was suddenly raised The effect was electrifying The standards of the minghans sprang back up The blocks of men seemed to expand stretch and then the entire tumen was in motion The hoarse echoing shouts of the war cry were replaced by a new sound the deep rumble of forty thousand hooves hammering the ground Even at the top of the ridge the ground seemed to tremble Hai Yamun cried leaping to his feet He chafed with the desire to be at the front leading the advance Unable to be there he paced impatiently back and forth issuing orders Goyuks men crossed the plain in a wellordered charge It was not a wild pellmell rush Instead the minghans advanced at a trot keeping in a line abreast Gradually as they closed the distance to the enemy line the horses picked up speed first to a canter then a full gallop Across the plain the spears of the Shou rippled in anticipation Yamun waited for the moment when the lead horsemen would suddenly slow their charge just short of the enemy loose a flight of arrows from their bows and gallop away stinging the enemy into pursuit That moment never arrived From the ridge Yamun could see the front of the rushing wave of horsemen reach the point where they were in range to fire just inside the long shadow of the Dragonwall Down the length of the Tuigan line the ground rippled then surged upward exploding in a fountain of dust and rock There was a shrieking grind of stone grating on stone and a rolling thunder as the earths crust tore asunder Another voice higher than the roar of upthrusting earth pierced through the din the screaming wail of men and horses their voices fused into a single cry Yamun shouted in astonishment and outrage The frontmost ranks of the Goyuks tumen had suddenly disappeared crushed by dirt and stone The next ranks unable to swerve their charging mounts were swallowed by the curtain of dust that roiled outward Here and there the swirling tornado parted to reveal geysers of earth erupting amidst the panicked riders Boulders tumbled and bounced crashing through the remaining ranks of horsemen leaving bloody and crushed bodies in their wake Under the onslaught the tumen wavered and began to fall back The riders farthest from the churning earth wheeled their mounts and began to flee Their panic was infectious Standards started to drop as more men turned to run Impossibly one section of the Tuigan line held firm and pressed forward lunging into the chaotic landscape At the center of the mass was Goyuks bluestreamered banner The dust clouds reached forward beckoning the entire block of riders into their gloomy arms No Break off Goyuk Yamun shouted futilely as if he could recall the riders from where he stood The khahan whirled to his standardbearer Signal them to withdraw Suddenly Goyuks charge was engulfed in dust Fountains of dirt and rock erupted in the midst of the riders flinging men and horses like childrens toys A pall of clay descended on Goyuks banner and it disappeared from sight Eke Bayalun Yamun howled Get Mother Bayalun Where are her wizards They must stop this The khahan tore through his small group screaming out orders demanding reports but most of all bellowing for the presence of the second empress to explain the horror he was witnessing Never had the priest seen the khahan in such a rage A rider charged through the ranks of the Kashik behind the khahan whipping his horse furiously Leaping off his mount the man sprawled completely on the ground in front of the khahan pressing his face into the dirt A message from the second empress Lord Yamun The khahan whirled on the man poised to strike Speak he shouted over the rumble from the plain Without looking up the messenger yelled his mistresss words The second empress says the magic of the Shou has taken her wizards by surprise They are unable to do anything She asks if the foreign priest might know what causes the earth to heave She humbly begs forgiveness for her failure to Ill hear her excuses later the khahan snarled turning away from the man The messenger sprang to his feet and backed away groping for his horse One of the Kashik sympathetic to the mans fears quickly hustled the courier out of Yamuns sight The khahan looked toward the plain seeing only men and horses rushing through the clouds of dust My horse Yamun demanded A quiverbearer ran to fetch Yamuns white mare Standardbearer were going down there Prepare to ride The guards looked to each other then hurriedly began to find their mounts and take their positions around the khahan Without waiting for his guards to finish assembling Yamun urged his horse down the steep slope toward the plain The guards plunged after him their mounts halfsliding toward the bottom Sechen his tall muscular body towering out of the saddle drove his horse savagely to keep up with the khahan His master was riding blindly into a trap and the giant was determined to protect him The pair reached the bottom of the slope well ahead of the rest of the bodyguards Small knots of riders rode out of the swirling dust and galloped for the safety of the ridge Lone men and riderless horses fled in panic Weapons shields and armor were cast aside Yamun charged forward and then suddenly reined in his horse before the first knot of routed men Form up Make your stand here I command you The routed men skidded to a halt brought short by the wild apparition of the khahan that faced them Watch them Yamun ordered Sechen as he galloped off toward another fleeing group From atop the ridge Koja watched the khahan rush from point to point working to halt the rout and organize a proper defense The warlord was easy to spot by his banner white horse and the swarm of blackrobed guards who followed him everywhere His affect on the men was unmistakable as the broken ranks slowly halted their flight and began to reform into ragged lines Finally Yamun turned the task over to Sechen and climbed back up to his command post As he arrived a group of guards still clustered in his wake Koja moved quietly to his side Looking very tired Yamun sat on his stool For a long time he said nothing only watched the battlefield The dust was slowly settling leaving a clearer picture of the destruction Across the front was a line of churned earth and shattered rock Most of the dead or dying lay there crushed or trapped beneath the fallen stone On both sides of the wreckage there were still pockets of fighting A handful of Tuigan riders the leaders of the foremost rank were trapped on the far side of the magical earthwork There they fought though hopelessly outnumbered and surrounded In a few other places the Shou soldiers had foolishly scrambled forward over the broken ground believing all the Tuigan were crushed In pursuing the fleeing horsemen these small units were also trapped Battles involving these doomed Shou were brief Just when Koja became convinced the defeat had crushed the spirit out of Yamun the old warlord sat up shaking off the air of gloom and desperation that had settled upon him Find Goyuk if he lives I want to know what happened he commanded his old energy gradually returning to him As one messenger left he turned to another Tell Sechen to separate those who fled from the rest of the men He is to execute those who have no weapons Of the rest every man must be beaten for seven blows and every tenth man for twice times seven There are thousands of men down there Koja said in astonishment They shouldnt have run Yamun answered grimly He continued the orders The wizards are to be whipped seven blows for their failure And if Bayalun argues tell her she can either have them whipped or give me seven to execute Its her choice The man nodded and left to deliver the khahans orders Tell the yurtchis to bring the camp forward We will be staying here With a wave the khahan dismissed the remaining couriers When they had withdrawn an appropriate distance Yamun turned to the priest Now anda why did this happen The khahans voice was hard and measured I do not know What you saw if Im right was the work of a powerful spirit creature The priest spoke softly not wanting to commit himself without knowing more Youre saying this creature protects the Shou and wont let us attack the Dragonwall Yamun asked incredulously trying to understand the power he had just seen His rage and frustration were growing Perhaps I do not know Koja looked toward the carnage on the plain Can I defeat it anda I do not know Koja sighed I have never seen anything like this I do not know what to do Then think of something Yamun shouted slashing his knout against the ground Koja swallowed nervously I have had dreams I think the spirit spoke to me It called on you and me to free it from the wall It seemed to think that we had some power Thats all you know Yamun asked disappointed when the lama stopped talking Your plan is to wait for it to visit you in your sleep If I must Yamun Spirits are not easy things to command Koja was tired and almost lost his temper with the khahan He took a long slow breath then added I must seek guidance from Furo Talk to your god then And when you are done tell me how to defeat that thing Yamun thrust his finger toward the furrowed plain The servants will bring you anything you need I must attend to other things Yamun stood to go Teylass blessing on you anda he said just before he left And Furos on you Yamun the lama offered Koja watched the khahan descend once more onto the plain Paper and brush the priest ordered of a quiverbearer The man hurriedly brought the material and set it before Koja Taking up the brush the priest carefully wrote an elegy for the dead on the field below The poem was not composed out of artistic desire however the priest needed the verse for the spell he wished to cast Finished with the poem he read it through then set it aside See that no one disturbs me Koja ordered the servant The man nodded in understanding The lama closed his eyes and began to recite prayers For ten minutes he droned on never raising his voice Then he stopped opened his eyes and touched the paper to flame The thin sheet quickly burned the ashes drifting into the air The lama closed his eyes again and waited Abruptly he opened his eyes and stood up The spell was over he had communed with his god With one foot he scattered the remaining ashes A small group of quiverbearers had gathered to watch his strange behavior Now they hurriedly went back to their tasks afraid Koja would put a curse on them Where is Yamun the lama demanded One of the servants nervously pointed toward the west At his yurt great historian Not wasting any time Koja found his horse and rode to Yamuns tent When the lama was announced Yamun quickly cleared the yurt and had his anda ushered in Sit and tell me what youve learned the khahan said as soon as Koja stepped through the door Mighty Furo saw fit to hear my prayers Koja said as he took his seat Yamun got off his throne and sat on the floor closer to his anda And It was a spirit that attacked today a spirit that is trapped in the Dragonwall Koja eagerly explained The same spirit spoke to me in dreams although Furo did not say why it chose to But can it be destroyed Yamun demanded holding up a fist Koja shook his head No not destroyed Furo said it craves release There is some way to free it How anda how Yamun stared at Koja awaiting his answer The lama took a deep breath For that I must consult the spirit of the Dragonwall Then do it Yamun said as he headed for the door I cannot said Koja bringing the khahan to a stop I cannot until I rest These spells are very tiring I will be ready tonight before the dawn And I will need an offering one suitable to something as powerful as this spirit must be Is this possible Yamun It will be arranged Yamun assured the lama as he slowly walked back to his throne What happens after you talk to this spirit I do not know Koja admitted I have never done this type of thing before A Kashik slowly appeared at the door making sure that the khahan knew of his presence Behind him came one of Yamuns couriers A message from Sechen the Wrestler Great Lord explained the Kashik stepping aside to let the messenger speak Speak your message Yamun ordered Sechen sends me to report that Goyuk Khan is dead The messenger bowed his head and stood quietly Yamun walked to the door and looked out over the plain the pain clear in his face Slowly and deliberately he spoke Shou Lung will pay His voice implied no threat no promise only a certainty that he would break the Dragonwall and gain his vengeance on the emperor who cowered behind it Traitors That night was a somber one in the Tuigan camp The yurtchis following Yamuns instructions had moved the tents forward so that by late evening the yurts were in position Campfires covered the ridge and the near side of the plain before the Dragonwall Yamun ordered the men to build extra fires to make the army seem even larger Still no fire was closer than what Koja Bayalun and her wizards determined was safe The distant tumble of rocks served as a reminder of what could happen to any who ventured too close to the Shou fortification The fires of the Tuigan were matched by sparks of flame along the length of the Dragonwall The Shou troops had withdrawn behind the wall and now lined its ramparts In the darkness between the two forces jackals growled and fought over the carrion In the royal yurt Yamun sat searching for a way to break the stalemate The khahan had to be prepared in case Koja failed Sechen his duties among the troops finished stood at his usual place by the door Bayalun and Chanar sat at the khahans feet Though her mood was dark Bayalun sat calmly Chanar was openly agitated distressed by the actions of the Shou It was not according to the plan Yamun assumed the generals nervousness was caused by frustration at the days failure From the corner the scribe read aloud the reports from the scouts The news was not encouraging There was no hope of flanking the wall nor had the riders been able to find any weak spots along its length Some reported troop movements atop the wall but the numbers given were not large enough to alarm the khahan Other scouts screened the armys flanks watching for enemy repositioning So far these riders had seen nothing Other couriers carried dispatches from Prince Tomke The khahans third son was marching with his army to join Yamun Unlike his brothers Jad and Hubadai however Tomke was cautious and advanced with care The message claimed it would be several days before his men would arrive This last piece of news prompted Yamun to send his son an angry rebuke about his troops slowness Finally the scribe reached a sheet that arrived only a few hours before a scroll delivered from the Shou Carefully and slowly the ancient scholar read the crabbed characters holding the sheet close to his eyes to see it clearly in the dim light Khahan the note began The emperor of the Jade Throne is pleased to call you an equal to his sons You have seen the futility of attacking the unbreakable Dragonwall It is a truth that if you continue your greatness will only be dimmed by failure Let there be no quarrel between the Tuigan and the emperor of all Shou Lung Depart and go in peace As the scribe finished reading the note aloud Yamun looked at both Chanar and Bayalun They want us to surrender So it would seem Khahan Bayalun said Chanar only grunted in agreement Yamun picked at his teeth Mother Bayalun why did your wizards fail me today The accusation in the khahans voice was clear Unfazed by her stepsons obvious distrust Bayalun sat proud and stiffbacked as she gave her explanation The wizards failed you no more than your own men They were unprepared for what happened And why did it happen Yamun pressed It is a mystery Bayalun admitted She lowered her eyes to the floor abashed at being forced to admit her ignorance When will your wizards know Tomorrow That is when they must be ready Yamun insisted nodding to the scribe to write the order If my son my husband were to rescind his orders to have the wizards beaten I am certain they will be able to help tomorrow Bayalun kept looking to the floor seeking Yamuns favor with mock humility They deserve to be beaten Yamun snapped Perhaps the second empress allowed But if they are beaten they will be too weak to fight tomorrow Then give me seven of them to make an example to the others Bayalun stiffened No Their numbers are few and you will need them all tomorrow She realized her defiance had backed Yamun into a corner with no way to save face Tomorrow if they fail you may do as you wish with all of them the khadun offered Yamun bristled at her disobedience knowing he could not force her to comply with the conflict looming before his army Very well he said his voice tinged by his illtemper Make certain theyre ready There will be no more failures He pointed at her to accent his words Her face a mask Bayalun nodded in understanding Finished with the question of wizards Yamun turned his attention to Chanar My general with Goyuk slain Im giving you command of the Ciejan Ormusk and Ulu tumens Ill take the rest Chanar bowed his head in gratitude Will your men be ready for battle tomorrow the khahan asked Of course Yamun But how will we cross the plain Chanar gestured in the general direction of the wall Their magic will destroy us Yamun smiled enigmatically Perhaps not Now Chanar my valiant man we must make a plan Since we cannot get the Shou to chase us how do we attack their wall Stepping down from his throne Yamun sat on the rugs across from his general The scribe quickly unrolled a long narrow scroll between the two men Along one edge was a diagram of the Dragonwall showing the gates and the towers Opposite the wall were little circles denoting the camps of the Tuigan Chanar risked a glance toward Bayalun to see if she knew what the khahan intended Noting the generals perplexed look she gave a small quick shrug to show that she knew no more than he Chanar looked back to the map studying it briefly First Yamun we must find a way to reach the wall The broken dirt blocks our horses I agree Mother Bayalun the khahan called out without looking up from the map your wizards must clear a path through the broken earth Yes my husband the khadun answered quietly as she looked over their shoulders But the men will fear being crushed if the earth moves again Just do what you are ordered I will worry about the men How long will it take Yamun demanded impatiently Bayalun looked to the ceiling calculating the spells needed to do the task By morning I think Go then and see that it is done Yamun ordered Sechen lead a guard to protect the khadun Send me reports on her progress By your word it shall be done the soldier and the khadun both said at once As the pair left Bayalun eyed the big wrestler venomously She knew that the man was being sent to spy on her Yamun turned his attention back to the map If the paths were clear Chanar where would you make the attack Chanar studied the map stalling to conceal his discomfort The khahan did not suspect that tomorrow the general planned to overthrow him The khahan was in fact giving the traitor an opportunity to personally plan his downfall His intentions set Chanar studied the map in earnest I would strike here and here the general answered his hand sweeping over the map He tackled the problem with enthusiasm Things were almost like earlier times in the days when he and Yamun made plans to conquer the Dalats and Quirish Only now the stakes were much higher and the game subtler Quickly Chanar sketched out his ideas to Yamun The khahan listened then added these to his own plans never realizing that Chanar was planning treachery Together they argued and discussed working well into the night It was a slow process but gradually the two warriors created a plan of battle for the morning Ill have arbans sent into the mountains to cut trees for rams and ladders immediately Chanar promised The men will be ready to attack at dawn Excellent my anda Yamun said Tomorrow we will avenge Goyuk Go and rest There will be much to do when the sun rises With a wave he dismissed the general As the warrior left the tent Yamun settled back with satisfaction Chanar at times might be ambitious but Yamun thought that he could depend on the general The plan they had worked out was dangerous but sound Outside the tent Chanar sought out Bayalun at her yurt Telling the guards Yamun had posted there that he carried orders from the khahan the general was admitted with only the briefest announcement Chanar was not surprised to find Bayalun still awake meditating over her brazier Once safely out of earshot of the guard Chanar told her what had happened Why is he planning this Does he expect your wizards to keep the ground from tearing open again Chanar asked in bewilderment I do not know Bayalun confessed I have sat here and pondered on it The Shou have built some secret into their wall Of that I am certain But why Yamun is confident he can overcome their magic is another mystery She shrugged off these concerns Whatever he does it will not matter If the Shou kill him with their magic or we catch him in the trap our plans will succeed Then he will fall Chanar observed Of coursejust as long as he makes the attack Bayalun glanced toward the vain general with a knowing smile Tomorrow my stepson will be dead Then we can see about making you the khahan of the Tuiganas you should be Chanar returned the smile though his heart was pained Tonight for a short time he and Yamun were anda once more Tomorrow that bond would be severed forever While Chanar and Bayalun plotted in her yurt Koja and a small group of guardsmen picked their way between the Tuigan camp and the Dragonwall Quietly the company moved through the ruins of the battlefield toward the line of tumbled dirt and stone that marked the limit of that days charge Several times the men came across bands of jackals or viler creaturesgigantic centipedes and carrion wormsfeasting on the bodies of the dead The sight sickened the priest but there was little he could do for the dead now He said a few quick prayers for the fallen warriors The corpses reminded Koja that he should attempt to speak to the dead guard discovered that morning providing he ever got the chance There was something about the way the bodies were found that nagged at his brain Its probably nothing the lama assured himself so he could keep his mind on the business at hand However this was a war and you cant be too careful The band finally reached the churned rocky ground that marked the beginning of the destruction Here priest asked the guide a grizzled Kashik with long gray braids Koja shook his head and whispered with exaggerated caution On the other side as close to the Dragonwall as possible The Kashik looked ahead apprehensively then began carefully picking a path through the rubble Strict orders were given down the line not to talk or make any unnecessary noise Slowly the men walked over the top of the mound and started down the loose slope on the other side Each time a stone skittered down the slope the men froze waiting for a challenge It was a painful hour before they reached the bottom The dark shadow of the Dragonwall stood out distinctly ahead of them Koja and the men were close enough to make out individual soldiers at the top of the wall outlined against the fires they had built to keep them warm Now hissed the Kashik at Koja The lama only shook his head Stealthily the group moved forward from shadow to shadow toward a nearly deserted section of the wall At last they were at the base of the fortification Now no one spoke The guards watched warily as Koja sat preparing his spell Alone the priest carefully unwrapped the offering he broughtthe khahans sword and jewelencrusted scabbard He hoped this would be sufficient to contact the spirit Very softly he began to murmur sutras similar to those he had used earlier in the day The lama spoke with exaggerated clarity and care At the closing words of the prayer the priest fell into a trance Quickly something writhed out of the wall near Koja At first it only seemed to be a small tendril of smoke then it grew expanding and swelling Finally it coalesced into the transparent outline of a huge dragon The long serpentine coils of its body lazily circled the priest The flowing fanged face stopped directly in front of him The dragons body seemed to glimmer from reflected light even though there was no light to reflect The creatures scales shone with iridescent colors The spirit was massive and yet moved with an ethereal grace It looked solid yet floated lightly It was a spirit unreal yet appeared real before Kojas eyes Why have you summoned me the spirit bellowed inside the priests mind Its voice was the voice of Kojas old master and it triggered the priests memories of lectures given in the great hall of the temple The words made the stubble on the back of the lamas shaven head prickle I call you in the name of the Illustrious Emperor of the Tuigan Yamun Khahan answered Koja as bravely as he could His voice was barely a whisper though this did not matter to the spirit Then he has come came the voice suddenly keen with interest A claw transparent to everyone but Koja carved furrows in the earth in front of the priest Are you the spirit that lives beneath the Dragonwall I am the spirit of the Dragonwall roared the dragon now using the voice of the khahan in Kojas mind Do you serve Shou Lung Koja asked trembling before the might of the spirit I do not serve the Shou oxen crashed the khahans voice The dragon twitched and thrashed as if lashing out at some invisible foe There was no mistaking the bitterness and hatred in its voice Koja wished he could flee Are you bound to serve them the priest timorously asked They are my captors The priest cringed before the furyladen voice that assaulted his mind I must do as they bid Did you speak to meask me to free you I called to you in hope that you would bring your lord Together you must free me This time the dragon adopted the soft voice of Kojas mother Why me Koja asked softly Why not another in the Tuigan camp There was one other amongst the barbarians I considered little priest While she had the magical ability necessary she cannot be trusted The dragon growled ominously No Not trusted at all Who do you mean great spirit Koja said a little desperation creeping into his voice Do you speak of the second empress Mother Bayalun I will not say whom but I know that you should look to the bodies of the dead for answers But That is all I will say on that matter the spirit roared Why have you not sought freedom before Koja asked after a short pause There must have been others Of course there were little priest I showed them to you Or have you forgotten your dream The spirit had resumed using the voice of Kojas old master Many have tried to break through my bonds but all have failed You saw them there That was the price of their failure The dragon paused fading slightly before Kojas eyes And their failures have added to my pain The Shou devil who tricked me and cast me into the wall placed a condition on my curse I can contact anyone I think might help me to escape However everyone that fails to release me and exact suitable revenge for me against the Shou is allowed to punish me throughout eternity In the spirit world they stand at my side and hammer away The dragon quivered with anger So you see little priest I only contact those who have a good chance to succeed in crushing Shou Lung Otherwise they add to my torment How can you be freed Koja asked I need a sacrifice This time the spirit chose to answer with Goyuks voice A sacrifice What does your lord offer his god That is what I must have the spirit demanded in Yamuns voice Its tail lashed at the wall its prison No less little priest Suddenly the dragon flowed back into the wall molding its body to the shape of the stone But the spirit didnt fade Instead it expanded stretching along the length of the wall past the watchtowers and through the gates The twinkling of the watch fires played off its scales as its body rippled and grew until the head and tail disappeared from sight Slowly the scales blended into the stone The iridescent colors faded the patterns of scale and stone blending together I am the Dragonwall the spirit whispered as it faded from sight Slowly the world returned to normal for Koja The darkness of the night closed over the priest driving away the unearthly glow that had surrounded the spirit From above Koja could hear the faint voices of the Shou sentries and the flapping of their robes as a cold wind blew across the battlements Lama whispered the Kashik guide seeing Koja stir for the first time in a halfhour Nervously the man stepped up to Kojas side Are you well Numbly Koja nodded his head He made ready to go automatically reaching for the sword Yamun had given as an offering It was gone Several long scars marked the ground where it had been As slowly as before the group moved away from the Dragonwall To Koja their pace seemed agonizingly slow He was in a hurry to tell Yamun what he had learned If the khahan intended to free the spirit tomorrow there was much to prepare It took almost two hours for Koja and his men to return to Yamuns camp By now it was early in the morning Dawn would come in a few more hours Still the camp was not quiet Riders were leaving for the mountains to cut timber for tomorrows assault The burial details were organizing for the task of burning yesterdays dead Koja arrived at Yamuns yurt dogtired The khahan was still awake As soon as the lama arrived Yamun had the weary priest ushered in Sechen see that we are not disturbed by anyone The big man bowed and herded the guards out the door With everyone out Yamun sat beside the priest Now anda the khahan asked earnestly what did you learn His voice automatically dropped to a conspiratorial whisper His weatherbeaten face was flushed with excitement making his scars stand out clearly More than I expected I think Koja managed to answer There was a spirit there and I talked to it At least I think I talked to it He rubbed his head to massage away a building headache Fatigue was making it hard for him to think Anyway Koja continued we communicated I was right we can free itor maybe just a little part of it I dont know for sure It was very big The more Koja spoke the more enthused he became What Explain yourself priest Ive no time for puzzles The army must attack soon The khahan got up and paced occasionally slapping his hand against his side I am not sure I can Yamun Koja apologized before he began Do you remember the story I told you about the making of the Dragonwall Yamun grunted Im not sure it was just a story The dragon spirit I spoke to is the Dragonwall The Shou did not build the wall from ordinary earth and stone The Dragonwall was built with the body of an earth spirit Koja swiveled as he spoke trying to face the khahan as the warlord stalked about the yurt But whats the point Yamun snapped The power of the wall comes from the dragon spirit Somehow the builders bound the spirit to the wall so it cannot leave even though it wants to It is trapped inside the wall So So it seems to think that youand Iare special In particular it expects you to obtain its vengeance by crushing Shou Lung This spirit is wise After all I will conquer Shou Lung Yamun rubbed at his chin considering the spirits words Yamuns boastfulness didnt phase the lama He knew the khahan was unshakable in his conviction Yamun he continued we might be able to free it at least in this area Once the spirit leaves the Dragonwall becomes nothing but an ordinary wall perhaps even less Remember the spirits power is part of what the builders used to hold the wall togetherlike mortar for stone Youre saying that if the spirit goes the Dragonwall could be torn down Yamun considered the information trying to make sure he understood everything There will need to be a sacrifice Koja added Of what Koja thought back to the night in the thunderstorm Horses I think Fine ones Isnt that the offering you make to Teylas Koja shivered at the thought uncomfortable at being part of such a rite Such sacrifices were not the way of the Enlightened One Horses will be no problem Yamun stated flatly There was something else Koja added his voice calmer The spirit hinted something about a woman of great magical power Perhaps he meant the second empress The spirit said that she was not to be trusted He looked at the floor partially out of respect to the khahan and partially out of fear Shes never to be trusted Yamun said dismissing the lamas concerns Koja would not be put off No it was more than that It was how the spirit said it Im worried that someoneprobably Bayalunis planning something Yamun continued his pacing showing no sign of surprise If I ask her shell only deny this Koja looked at the khahan I may have a way to check he offered hesitantly You remember the guard and the Shou who were found dead before the battle What of them the khahan asked from across the yurt Koja stood up The spirit said something about looking to the dead for answers The priest paused then added Something didnt seem right about those bodies The guard had his throat cut as if someone had surprised him If that happened who killed the Shou Koja found himself pacing in time with the khahan Odder things have happened priest the khahan cautioned stopping his stride He set a hand against the tent post examining the wood Perhaps Lord Yamun but I had the bodies hidden away I think it would be wise to speak with them Do you really think these two have anything to do with Bayalun Yamun asked skeptically Koja scratched his head I dont know Spirits often mislead people he admitted but it is all I can think to do I am ready We could find out right now The khahan looked at the priest without really seeing him his eyes focused on something intangible One hand unconsciously played with the tips of his mustache Very well Try But you must be quick Certainly Yamun Koja answered with a bow Going to the tent door the lama gave instructions to Sechen The wrestler again stood watch having arranged for Bayaluns guard It didnt take long for Koja and Sechen to set everything up in a secluded yurt where their activities would not be noticed The bodies had been stored carefully packed in snow to slow their decay Working quickly Koja stayed alone in the tent While Sechen stood guard outside the lama cast his spells When he emerged Koja looked drained The nights activities were taking their toll on him Remove the Tuigan warrior but bring the Shous head to Yamuns yurt the priest ordered as he hurried past Sechen I must see the khahan Arriving back at Yamuns yurt Koja wasted no time in describing what he had learned Grimly the khahan looked toward the priest Chanar too he asked his amazement coloring his words I am sorry Yamun the priest automatically mumbled Sorrow is for the weak Yamun suddenly growled Koja only nodded What will you do now Confront them the khahan said His face was set in a grim scowl He called for a quiverbearer to summon Chanar and Bayalun The servant hurried away with the message Neither Koja nor Yamun spoke while they waited The khahan sat brooding chin on hand Koja tried to imagine the dark thoughts passing through Yamuns mind He couldnt Yamuns grim mood was beyond him With a tired yawn the lama resigned himself to waiting The servant returned and pulled back the door flap Khahan they are here Yamun lifted his head Enter Bayalun and Chanar came into the yurt Sit Leading the way the second empress leaning heavily on her staff took her place Chanar followed behind then Sechen The two plotters seated themselves on the respective sides of the tent Bayalun alone at the head of the womens row Chanar opposite her Koja moved from his seat out of Chanars way The general eyed the lama warily then sat down at Yamuns feet Quietly Koja slid to the back of the yurt to stand alongside the impassive Sechen The wrestler quietly opened the door motioning an arban of soldiers to enter When all had taken their place Yamun ordered a basin of black kumiss brought forward Taking the ladle from the bowl he held it high presenting it to the four points of the compass Teylas grant us victory today The offering finished Yamun took his seat Today we go to conquer a great enemy Let the men be ready May Teylas grant us victory Chanar said in response He will General Yamun promised glaring down at Chanar Slowly Yamun extended the ladle to the last of the seven valiant men Just as the general reached for it Yamun tipped it pouring the black kumiss onto the rugs You were my anda the khahan snarled flinging the ladle out of reach Chanar was whitefaced and his mouth hung open in shock But Yamun I Quiet I know of your treachery You meet with the Shou You plot with them This is a lie Khahan Chanar shouted trembling where he stood Yamun stepped forward on his dais his broad frame towering over the ashen general The khahans eyes smoldered with fury Koja realized that Yamun enraged with Chanars deception had momentarily forgotten Bayaluns presence The priest looked her way She had stepped back from the confrontation The khaduns face was pale but no fear showed in her eyes only hatred and fury Bayalun took another step back as if trying to distance herself from Chanar Her hands reached into the sleeves of her robe She withdrew a small stone and began to trace small figures into the air Koja realized that Bayalun was casting a spell There was no one close enough to stop her in time The lama felt his pockets for some kind of weapon something he could throw He hit something hard at his chest the paitza his symbol of authority Frantically he yanked at the cord pulling the heavy metal plate free Bayalun the priest shouted trying to warn the khahan Yamun stopped his tirade astonished by the lamas cry just as Koja hurled the paitza across the yurt The silver plaque thudded against the khaduns arm jarring the stone from her grasp Bayalun screeched with rage and pain clutching at her side Guards seize the khadun Bind her hands Kill her if she attempts to speak Yamun pointed at the second empress Bayaluns eyes narrowed to slits even as she froze where she stood The guards were already around her their sabers drawn They grabbed the khaduns arms and pinned them to her side She struggled weakly but knowing Yamun was serious said nothing The guards quickly began lashing her wrists together Chanar seizing the distraction reached for his sword determined to fight his way free Before his sword cleared its scabbard Yamun drew his own blade and laid the edge against the generals breast Chanar turned slowly to face the khahan Do not draw it General or Ill kill you Yamun spoke coldly his eyes steely Take the khadun out Chanar swallowed Why Yamun he asked weakly The remaining guards closed slowly around him The general unbuckled his swordbelt and laid it on the ground Yamun stepped back and spat at Chanars feet Tomorrow you and my stepmother He turned his glare on the departing Bayalun You planned to destroy me This is a lie Who says this Chanar blustered glaring at everyone around him Yamun sheathed his own sword and reached into a leather bag that sat beside his throne From it he lifted the head of the Shou warrior Chanar had killed This is your accuser Yamun replied tossing the head at Chanar It fell with a thump at the generals feet Chanar wavered then kicked the head aside with a snarl A dead thingnothing more You are a fool Yamun Chanar sneered no longer trying to hide his contempt Though spirits may trick us the dead cannot lie Koja said softly from the back of the yurt Chanar wheeled on the lama Youthis is your doing No Chanar You did this to yourself Yamun said behind him You were my andathe last of my valiant men I gave you honors and trust and this is how you have repaid me Yamun sank back onto his throne chin sunk to his chest You gave me nothing Chanar snarled I saved you from your enemies I fought your battles My father took you in when your own people drove you out My warriors made you khan of the Hoekun I have stood by you and now you spend your time with a foreign priest while I ride as your errand boy You will betray us all send us to death against this Shou wall to satisfy your own ambitions Chanars chest heaved with emotion Yamun shifted onto the balls of his toes his hand clenched around the hilt of his sword I should kill you The general braced himself for the blow But I wont Chanar stepped back intimidated and confused Hear this Yamun announced loudly although only Koja Sechen and the guards were there to hear For his courage and bravery I have chosen General Chanar to stand at my side in battle today Chanar will be the bravest khan in the center Make sure thats known throughout the army Chanar started in surprise caught offguard by the khahans sudden declaration Yamun continued Tell them also that today Ive made Sechen one of the khans Sechen you will command Chanars men They are not yours to give Chanar protested an edge of panic creeping into his voice Yamun whirled on the general You are nothing anymore Have you forgotten You will stand where I tell you you will fight where I tell you The khahan kicked Chanars sword and scabbard off to the side and stormed closer to his old companion You live only because you were once my anda and that cannot be undone Tomorrow you will ride as a hero in battle If you die there your name will be forever remembered as one of my valiant men Yamun said slowly Chanar sagged His plans had collapsed and the fight went out of him Take him away and keep a guard on him Yamun shouted irritably to the Kashik Turning to Chanar as he prepared to leave Yamun said You will ride with me one last time If you live you will be banished from my sight Go and prepare for battle Teylas will take us to victory Ai The guards hailed the benediction to the khahans words Yamun turned his back as the guards led Chanar out My anda my true anda the khahan called to Koja You will stay Arms nervously crossed the priest stood quietly by the door Yamun turned to face the lama The khahan looked very tired Koja once again you have acted wisely and well It pains me that I cannot honor you for what you have done but it is not a custom for outsiders to become khans I do not seek honors Yamun Koja said sincerely But what are you going to do with Bayalun You need her wizards to clear the battlefield The khahan joined Koja at the doorway pulling aside the tent flap to look out on the camp For now we keep her arrest a secret Guards will visit her wizards Well tell the wizards shes ill Perhaps you can to tend her Yamun suggested with a mirthless smile After we break the Dragonwall there will be time to decide If we all survive Koja thought to himself The Final Assault It was the largest array of warriors Koja had seen yet The sun was just rising over the eastern horizon From the top of the ridge the priest watched as the creeping rays of morning struck the outermost edge of the right flank The golden light touched the mass of lance tips breastplates shields bridles swords every bit of metal the warriors had It looked as if some god were pouring gems from the heavens over the Tuigan horde Koja guessed that there were two hundred thousand men perhaps more gathered on the edge of the plain They were lined up as far from the Dragonwall as their commanders could manage After yesterdays disaster no one wanted his men too far out in the open The valleys leading onto the plain were choked with columns of horsemen backed up behind the leading tumens The men were organized into dense blocks each unit separated from its neighbors Yamun supervised the disposition of the units from his vantage point on the ridge Chanar was nearby ostensibly part of the khahans honored command A group of wellarmed Kashik accompanied the general wherever he went Bayalun was being held secretly in a yurt far from her own guards Their mistresss fate kept from them Bayaluns wizards had done their job well While the army moved into position the spellcasters had used their powers to disintegrate boulders and move mounds of earth out of the way By daybreak they had cleared several wide level breaks through the rubble Surveying the openings from the hill Yamun decided these were more than adequate for the attack In the distance the Dragonwall too underwent a change In the shadowy predawn light the wall was a brooding monolith As the sun rose the gloomy walls became redgold The towers and cornices were etched in sharp relief against the green and brown land beyond Along the battlements a glinting line of light from the defenders spearpoints shone like small fangs From where the khahan stood the Dragonwalls majesty was inspiring Come anda its time for battle Yamun grunted He looked out over his army Today is a great day I will either conquer Shou Lung or I will lose every man I have Koja looked toward the khahan I thought you were certain of victory I ambut it may not be today If I am beaten here Ill go back and build a new army Ive been beaten before Yamun shaded his eyes to look toward the Dragonwall But I wouldnt like to lose Yamun concluded with a wry smile Now anda its time The khahan was dressed as he had been the day before indeed the man hadnt changed out of his war clothes at all Koja himself wore the same suit of armor he had worn at the Battle of Manass as he had come to call it although Hodj had at least found the time to size it better The armor was still heavy and hot but at least it didnt chafe as badly I am coming Yamun Koja answered He didnt want to be in the middle of the battle but he had no choice It was his duty to supervise the sacrifice which had to take place closer to the wall Trotting to catch up with Yamun he reined in his mount alongside the warlord As is the custom of our people Yamun said I have ordered one hundred of my finest white mares to be given to this spirit Is this enough I do not know Would it be sufficient to please your god Teylas More than enough I should think Yamun leaned over in his saddle to issue the final orders to a waiting messenger Satisfied that the man understood the commands the khahan sent the messenger on his way Another messenger came forward to take the mans place As he neared the main body of the army Yamun halted motioning for the guards to bring Chanar forward The general sat rigidly on his horse refusing to look at the khahan Chanars pride seemed to be all that was sustaining him Chanar Ong Kho Yamun said solemnly In a few moments we will ride among the army I will give you the place of honor for our coming battleleading the first charge against the Shou I give you this because you are my anda and only because of that Do not dishonor yourself before the entire army Chanar made no attempt to answer Give him his weapons Yamun said then spurred his horse forward The khahans route took him and his entourage through the heart of the two hundred thousand Koja marveled at the mens discipline It reminded him just how well trained Yamuns soldiers were Their insouciance on the march belied their rigid discipline on the field of battle Two hundred thousand men waited on their horses in strict lines ten men to an arban one hundred to a jagun which in turn formed minghans of one thousand and the minghans were grouped into massive tumens Each tumen formed a block of riders ten riders deep and one thousand men across At their center was the tumens standard while the banners of the minghans formed a line of signal flags each man could see Two hundred thousand men and animals made enough noise for their presence to be known As the khahan passed the men hailed him with a mighty cheer Even the ranks far from the khahan were not silent There was a constant rumble as nervous men and horses waited for the signal to attack At last Yamun Koja and Chanar reached the head of the army Yamuns Kashik were set in the center of the line at the forefront of the army The khahan rode out to address them Men of the Kashik finest of my warriors Today we will crush the armies of the Jade Throne Ride under the banner of Chanar Ong Kho the finest of my valiant men Go forward and fight bravely for here we will succeed or die The Kashik raised a mighty shout beating their lances against their swords Hearing the clamor the rest of the army took up the cry The roar echoed in the valleys and across the plain Koja could not imagine what it must have sounded like to the Shou defenders on the walls At a signal from Yamun Chanar rode to the head of the Kashik Two standardbearers galloped behind one carrying Chanars banner and the other the standard of the Kashik The riders took their positions behind the general The command assigned Yamun galloped back to where Koja waited Taking a position next to his whitetailed battle standard Yamun surveyed the length of the line On one side were Chanar and the main body of the Kashik eight thousand strong To the other side of the khahan was a line of one hundred white horses each led by a Shou prisoner some of the few taken in yesterdays debacle Next to each horse was a quiverbearer The Tuigans black robes stood out starkly against the white mares Everything is ready Lord Yamun a khan said Good Koja begin The priest swallowed nervously and nodded Giving his horse a gentle whip forward he rode out ahead of the army The prisoners followed by the guards led the hundred horses after him Slowly the lama rode across the plain closer to the towering front of the Dragonwall He continued to ride forward entering the area that was shattered yesterday in Goyuks attack Bayaluns wizards had done a superb job of removing the rubble their magic cutting avenues through the broken ground There were still however grisly reminders of the men and horses that fell there only a day before The priest stopped when he got as close as he dared to the wall He could see Shou archers training their arrows on the Tuigan procession Only the presence of the Shou prisoners prevented them from firing Koja lowered his head took a deep breath and then looked up He felt calm too preoccupied to be afraid Spirit of the Dragonwall he called out hear me Yamun Khahan Illustrious Emperor of All People gives to you a sacrifice of blood Accept it and go in freedom and peace Koja whispered a prayer beseeching Furos forgiveness for what he was about to do The priest gave the signal as soon as the prayer was done Knives in hand one hundred guards reached out and slashed the throats of one hundred horses The death screams of the beasts rang in Kojas ears His own horse pranced and reared forcing the priest to open his eyes He could barely keep the mount under control All around him the mares stumbled forward or lashed at their grooms blood streaming down their white breasts soaking the ground Quickly they fell one by one into the dirt Koja was dazed He heard a roar At first the lama thought it was the war cry of the two hundred thousand men lined up behind him Then suddenly the ground trembled The shock waves built in strength and Kojas horse reared and bolted throwing the priest to the ground All around Koja the guards struggled to keep their mounts under control Scrambling to his feet the priest looked toward the Dragonwall and stopped in amazement It was buckling heaving upward the foundations tearing from the earth The brick masonry fell away in sheets sweeping guardsmen off the battlements The nearest watchtower heaved outward rising up before settling into a crumbled heap Koja looked to the gates The huge wooden doors groaned against each other The tall gatehouses swayed There was a piercing crack as the span between the two towers shattered raining stone onto the Shou garrison below Koja surprised and terrified sprinted for the safety of the khahans banner The guardsmen around him were also galloping for the safety of the Tuigan line The ground heaved again hurling the panting lama into the dirt Sweat and dust running into his eyes Koja stumbled to his feet and reeled forward Unexpectedly a hand thrust under his arm squeezing his chest With a jerk the priest was pulled from his feet and hauled on the back of a galloping mare Hold tight little lama Kojas rescuer announced The Kashik looked back at the priest with a snaggletoothed grin Gasping Koja clung to the mans waist Behind him he could still hear the rumbling crash of masonry Whats happening priest What did you do shouted the rider over his shoulder More than I thought Koja shouted back The guard reined the hurtling steed to a stop just in front of the khahans banner Koja tumbled to the ground and the horseman easily swung his mount around and galloped to his position in the battle line We cannot fight in this madness Yamun shouted over the building noise Hold the signal for the attack until the wall stops moving The khahan sprang from his horse and stormed over to where the lama was sprawled Look Koja cried as he glanced back toward the Dragonwall He pointed to the great fortification A great taloned claw burst through the soil then another gouging into the dirt along the structures foundations The wall split and cracked revealing a spiny scaled back arching and pushing upward The scales glistened blue and brown along the length of the reptilian hide Far to the right away from the gate the fortification exploded scattering shards of brick and granite across the plain Broken men hurtled off the battlements and fell crushed to the ground A coiling tail forked and pointed thrashed free of the shattered battlements Clouds of dust began to roil away from the stone wall driven forward by the collapsing stone The grinding roar of cracking stone and the faint screams of men and horses were overwhelmed by a new sound a howling cry of tremendous volume It was part animalistic roar part shouted cry Koja wondered if this was the true voice of the dragon spirit Suddenly the great gate shivered Wood shrieked as the massive doors warped and bent There was a popping crack as the hardwood valves split the force of the sudden release blowing the wooden gates outward The stone gatehouses to either side twisted and heaved The immense gate of the Dragonwall was shattered Standardbearer Get ready Yamun shouted barely heard over the destruction We ride forward now The khahan ran back and mounted his unruly horse Koja also ran to a horse Over his shoulder he looked back at the wall There in the yawning gate the lama saw a pair of eyes glistening with a lambent blue fire fringed by the ornate carapace of a great dragon It was the same set of eyes he had seen last night The vision lasted only a second Driven by the sudden rush of wind a column of dust spiralled into the air explosively pushing the gatetowers to the side The blockhouses splintered and fell crashing onto the remains of the wall to either side of the gate The banners of Shou that once adorned the tower peaks were snatched away by the wind and carried into the sky Koja watched too numb to be amazed as the writhing column solidified to become the twisting serpentine shape of a majestic dragon Before the priest could see any more a choking cloud of dust and sand swept over the Tuigan line The whirling sandstorm passed in no more than a few minutes Even before the dust cleared the thunderous crashes of rock died away After the chaos that came before everything now seemed still Coughing and gagging Koja struggled with his horse It worked priest Better than you promised Yamun shouted Koja turned and looked where the khahan pointed Ahead where the Dragonwall had been with its imposing gate and towering walls was a gaping breach The gatehouses were shattered the heavy wooden doors in splinters The towers had fallen away from the road leaving the opening clear At other points to the left and right the wall was also breached tumbled into rough piles Yamun barked out commands as he gestured toward points along the wall Standardbearer signal Chanar He is to take the Kashik through the center He will lead the attack Hurry Hurry before they can recover Yamun yelled at the dazed khans around him shouting them into motion It dawned on Koja that he stood in the path of two hundred thousand warriors Quickly he tried to move his horse to the side but there was no safe escape He could either charge forward into battle or risk being trampled where he stood Signal the khans to be ready Yamun ordered The white yak tails dipped giving the signal the warriors waited for As the command was relayed through the army the men of each tumen raised their war cry Once again the air thundered with the voice of destruction Attack shouted the khahan nodding to the drummers The war drums sounded signaling the Kashik to move Chanar for a second reined in his horse almost refusing to charge The Kashik began to advance behind him anyway Finally the general stood in his saddle and whipped his horse forward The mount leaped into motion and behind it swept the blackrobed mass of the Kashik eight thousand strong Before the first men had even reached the crumbled wall Yamun was shouting orders for the other tumens to charge and whipped his own horse forward Yamun charged at full gallop surrounded by his khans Koja rode in their midst dragged along by the wave of men around him In a moment the Tuigan reached the shattered gate in another they poured through the breach The Shou garrison that once manned the walls and filled the towers was shattered Generals and troopers alike had been lost Those who survived were already streaming back from the broken fortification some forming ragged units of several thousand many more fleeing the mounted doom that poured through the gaps With a howl of triumph the Tuigan horsemen swept down upon the routed enemy The great battle of the Dragonwall was won before it had even begun Epilogue Koja sipped on a cup of tea brewed in the Shou style On his throne Yamun drank the vile salted brew favored by the Tuigan In front of the warlord was spread a map of the Mai Yuan province of Shou Lung which had been found in the rubble of the gatetower On it Koja had carefully marked the movements of Yamuns scouts in broad red arrows They fanned out from a single point on the Shou frontier reaching like fingers into the interior The scouts had been riding for many days some harrying the fleeing enemy and others shadowing the small garrisons that were now on the move The scope of the Tuigan success had come as a surprise to the khahan and Koja suspected to the Shou emperor too Yamun Koja asked as he blew the steam off his cup what will you do now Continue the invasion Yamun looked up from slurping his tea First well wait for Hubadai and his men Then we must fatten the horses When this is done Ill conquer Shou Lung Yamun answered confidently The priest didnt doubt the khahans resolve Already Yamun had done more than Koja thought was possible Shou Lung is huge Khahan You do not have the men to rule all of this land Before I worry about ruling it I must conquer it Yamun pointed out Besides I have men like you to manage my empire The khahan rolled up the map Now there is business to attend to The khahan set his tea aside and called to the quiverbearer near the door Bring the prisoners in The man quickly stepped outside There were a few muffled commands and then the door flap was pulled open Sechen now a khan and several Kashik entered the yurt and took positions by the walls Immediately after came Chanar and Bayalun The general was still dressed in the clothes he had worn into battle several days ago They were dirty bloodstained and torn Bayalun wore a simple brown and yellow robe The sleeves were long hiding the bonds on her wrists On Kojas advice the khaduns hands were bound to keep her from casting spells The priest did not see any need to gag her Both conspirators moved slowly reluctantly They obviously dreaded this audience The guards led the pair to the center of the yurt and roughly pushed them down to their knees Chanar kept his eyes to the floor but Bayalun glared venomously at her stepson Yamun rose from his throne and slowly circled the two Finally he spoke in solemn tones Youve been proven guilty of treachery against your khahan Now I must give my final judgment At this Chanar raised his head stubbornly ready to meet whatever doom Yamun might name By law Yamun continued you should be taken into the wilderness and strangled This would satisfy the ancient codes of our people He paused and let the prisoners think about their fate With a heavy sigh the khahan continued Ill not do this Yamun stopped at his scribes table and motioned for the man to write down his words General Chanar Ive not forgotten the battles where you stood at my side when all were ready to run My anda once I swore that I would forgive your crimes though they were nine times nine This I have done General Chanar I let you live But you will no longer command the tumens of the Tuigan I banish you from my sight to the command of a minghan of scouts The pained look on the generals face told everyone that he considered that fate worse than death Yamun looked down at the scribe who was furiously writing A jagun of troops are to be Chanars guard If any evidence of further treachery comes to my attention Chanar will be put to death The khahan turned to his onceloyal friend Perhaps you may work your way back to a command but do not think to cross me again The khahan scowled as he turned to his stepmother Bayalun Khadun youve done much and deserve a painful long death The woman stiffened However I have no guarantee that death will end your plotting Your sorcerous powers could strike from beyond the grave At the suggestion of my anda you are to retire from worldly life and renounce your claim to the title khadun Your guards are disbanded You will spend the rest of your days in the magicdeadlands of Quaraband Sechen Khan is your jailor Do you object to this Mother Bayalun paled Yamuns sentence was as good as death However Bayalun knew that any protests would be futile No she whispered I welcome a fate that removes you from my sight Then let all those who oppose these orders know that they are by the khahans will Yamun said Get them out of my sight Sechen see that the orders are carried out As the two were led out Yamun scooped himself a ladleful of kumiss He stood breathing deeply letting the anger flow out of him What do you want to ask Koja he suddenly inquired seeing the priest still quietly sitting in the corner Koja looked at Yamun in embarrassed surprise Bowing his head to hide his reddened face the priest finally spoke Yamun I do not understand why you let Chanar and Bayalun live It is commendable in the eyes of the Enlightened One but it is very dangerous isnt it Yamun set down his cup and rested his chin on his hand Ive given it much thought For Bayalun loss of her magic is a horrible fate What about Chanar Koja asked setting his own cup of tea aside Chanar is my anda Yamun answered sadly I cannot change that so I cannot kill him Once he loved me He looked away from the priest Koja sat quietly waiting for Yamun to continue Hell have a small command somewhere my Kashik can easily watch him Chanar is ambitious but not that clever Bayalun was the one behind these plots The khahan picked up his tea once more and sank back onto his throne What will you do now Khazari Yamun finally asked Will you stay with me or go back and be a priest Koja rubbed his itching scalp The stubble on his pate was getting long enough to irritate Ruefully he sighed Do not call me Khazari I know I am no longer that I might not be priest much longer either I have not served Furo well I fear the temple will not have me anymore He forced a wistful smile thinking of what he had lost If neither your country nor your god want you anda who will you serve Yamun asked although he already knew the answer Koja took a large swallow of tea You my anda If you will let me stay You can become Tuigan the khahan offered He set his cup aside and waited expectantly for the priests answer Watch me conquer Shou Lung Write your history so that all the world will know of my greatness Koja looked at the khahan It was impossible to ignore the hard sure confidence in his eyes Shou Lung was huge its armies were numerous but this time the priest did not doubt Yamuns words Yes Koja said after a while The world will certainly come to know your greatness RASALVATORE THE HUNTERS BLADES TRILOGY The Hunters Blades Trilogy Book I THE THOUSAND ORCS c2002 Wizards

Bastion of Darkness TARZAN The Epic Adventures STAR WARS NEW JEDI ORDER Vector Prime STAR WARS Attack of the Clones Oh well ye got to be pullin harder than that Tred McKnuckles yelled to his team of two horses and three dwarves Im hoping to be making Shallows afore the summer sun shines on me balding head His voice echoed off the stone around them a bellow befitting one of Treds stature He was stout even as dwarves go with a body that could take a beating and lumpy arms that could dish one out He wore his yellow beard long often tucked into the front of his huge belt and kept a throwing hammercommonly called a dwarven arrowstrapped on the back of each shoulder ready for launch Itd be easier if ye didnt have th other horse sitting in the back o the wagon ye blasted fool one of the pulling dwarves yelled back Tred responded by giving him a crack on the rump with the whip The dwarf stopped or tried to but the fact that the wagon kept on rolling and he was strapped into the yoke convinced him that maybe it would be a good idea to continue moving his strong and stubby legs Dont ye doubt that Ill be payin ye back for that one he growled at Tred but the other dwarves pulling and the three others still sitting up on the wagon beside the boss dwarf all just laughed at him They had been making fine progress since leaving Citadel Felbarr two tendays earlier chancing the north run along the western face of the Rauvin Mountains Breaking through to the flat ground the group had done some minor trading and resupplying at a large settlement of the Black Lion barbarian tribe Named Beorunnas Well it along with Sundabar Silverymoon and Quaervarr was a favored trading locale for the seven thousand dwarves of Citadel Felbarr Typically the dwarves caravans would run to Beorunnas Well swap their wares then turn back to the south to the mountains and their home but this particular group had surprised the leaders of the barbarian settlement and had pressed on to the westnorthwest Tred was determined to open up Shallows and the other smaller towns along the River Surbrin running the western edge of the Spine of the World for trade Rumors had it that Mithral Hall had for some unknown reason slowed its trade of late with the towns upriver and Tred ever the opportunist wanted Felbarr to fill that void Other rumors after all said that some pretty amazing gems and even a few ancient artifacts thought to he dwarven were being pulled from the shallow mines on the western edges of the Spine of the World The late winter weather had been quite favorable for the fifty mile run and the wagon had rolled along without incident past the northern tip of the Moonwood and right to the foothills of the Spine of the World The dwarves had gone a bit too far to the north however and so had turned south keeping the mountains on their right Still the temperatures had remained relatively warm but not so warm that they would destroy the integrity of the snow sheets and thus rain avalanches all about the trails That same morning though an abscess had reared its ugly head on the hoof of one of the horses and while the handy dwarves had been able to extract the stone the horse had picked up and drain the abscess the horse was not yet ready to pull the laden wagon It wasnt even walking very comfortably so Tred had the team put the horse up on the back of the large wagon then he split the other six dwarves into two teams of three They were quite good at it and for a long time the wagon had kept up its previous pace but as the second team neared the end of its second shift they were starting to drag Whenre ye thinking well get that horse back in the harness asked Duggan McKnuckles Treds younger brother whose yellow beard barely reached the middle of his chest Bah shell be trotting along tomorrow Tred answered with confidence and all the others nodded None knew horses better than Tred after all In addition to being one of the finest blacksmiths in all of Citadel Felbarr he was also the places most prominent farrier Whenever merchant caravans rolled into the dwarf stronghold Tred would inevitably be called upon usually by King Emerus Warcrown himself to shoe all the horses Might be that we should be putting up for the night then said one of the dwarves pulling along in front Set a camp eat us a good stew and lighten that load we got by a keg o ale Ho ho several of the others roared in agreement as dwarves usually did when the possibility of consuming ale was mentioned Bah yeve all gone soft on me Tred pouted Yere just wanting to beat Smig to Shallows Duggan declared Tred spat and waved his hands It was too obvious a protest Everyone there knew it was true enough Smig was Treds greatest rival two friends who pretended to hate each other but who in truth only lived to outdo each other Both knew that the small town of Shallows with its trademark tower and renowned wizard had seen an influx of people right before the winterfrontiersmen who would need fine weapons armor and horseshoes and both had heard King Warcrowns proclamation that he would be pleased to establish trading routes along the Spine of the World Since the recapture of the dwarven citadel which had been in orc hands for three centuries the area west of Felbarr had calmed considerably with the mountainous region to the east still buzzing with monstrous activity There was an Underdark route to Mithral Hall but none had been discovered thus far to open the lands north of Clan Battlehammers stronghold All of those accompanying Tred his workers including his brother Duggan Nikwillig the cobbler and the opportunistic brothers Bokkum and Stokkum who were carrying essential goods mostly ale for other Felbarr tradesmenhad eagerly signed on The first caravan would be the most profitable one taking their pick of the treasures garnered by the frontiersmen Even more important than that the first caravan would carry bragging rights and the favor of King Warcrown Right before the departure Tred had engaged Smiggly Smig Stumpin in a goodnatured drinking game but not before he had paid one of the Moradin priests well for a potion that defeated the effects of alcohol Tred figured that he and his had been out of Citadel Felbarr for a day and more before poor Smig had even awakened and another day before the dwarf could shrink his head enough to get out the citadels front door Tred would be damned if hed let a little thing like an abscessed horse hoof slow them down enough for Smig to have a chance of catching up Ye put up a trot for three more miles and well call it a good day Tred offered Groans erupted all about him even from Bokkum who stood to lose the most profits by an early camp and hence more ale consumed and less to sellthough the betting was that he wouldnt end up selling it in Shallows anyway and that hed take it back for the celebration on the return journey Two miles then Tred barked Are ye wanting to share a camp this night with Smig and his boys Bah Smig aint even out yet Stokkum said And if he is he and his got slowed plenty by the rockfall we dropped in the path behind us Nikwillig added Two more miles Tred roared He cracked the whip again and poor Nikwillig stood up very straight and managed to turn about enough to put a glower over the rugged driver Ye hit me again and Ill be making ye a pair o shoes ye wont soon be forgetting Nikwillig blustered His feet were digging little trenches as he got dragged along and that only made Tred and the others laugh all the louder Before Nikwillig could start his grumping again Duggan kicked up a song about a mythical dwarven Utopia a great town in a deep mine that would please Moradin himself Climb that trail Duggan crooned and several looked at him not sure if he was singing or ordering them around Break down that door Duggan went on prompting Stokkum to yell out What door But Duggan only continued Find that tunnel and run some more Ah Upsen Downs Stokkum yelled and the whole crew even surly Nikwillig couldnt resist and broke into a rowdy backslapping song Climb that trail Break down that door Find that tunnel and run some more Cross the bridge of fiery glow Running deeper down below Make some smiles from those frowns Yeve found the town of Upsen Downs Upsen Downs Upsen Downs Yeve found the town of Upsen Downs Upsen Downs Upsen Downs Make some smites from those frowns Yeve found the place othe finest ale With armsized pretzels thatre never stale With big Chef Muglump and his coney stew And Master Bumble with his forty brews And in the holes ye can break the rock and haul it up with yer tackle and block Smelt it down and ye II get it sold Upsen Downss got the finest gold Upsen Downs Upsen Downs Yeve found the town of Upsen Downs Upsen Downs Upsen Downs Make some smiles from those frowns It went on for many verses and when the seven dwarves ran out of the formal lines of the old song they just improvised as they always did with each piping in his own wants from such a remarkable place as Upsen Downs That was the fun of the dwarven song after all and also a fairly subtle way for any perceptive dwarf to take a good measure of a potential friend or a potential foe Also the song was a fine distraction mostly for the three tugging the wagon along backs bent and straining They made fine progress through those minutes bouncing along the rocky ground the mountains rising up to their right as they moved south along the trail In the drivers seat Tred called out names in order bellowing for each to add the next verse It went on smoothly until he called out to his little brother Duggan The other five kept humming providing the background but they went through almost an entire verse and there was still no response from Duggan Well Tred asked turning to regard his little brother and seeing a very confused look on Duggans face Ye got to sing in boy Duggan looked at him curiously confusedly for a long moment then quietly said I think I be hurt Only then did Tred look past that puzzled expression moving his head back and taking a wider view of Duggan Only then did Tred notice the spear sticking out of Duggans side He gave a shriek and the humming behind him stopped with the two sitting in the back of the wagon turning to regard the slumping Duggan Up front it quieted too but not completely until a huge boulder whistled down slamming the path right beside the three surprised dwarves and bouncing over them clipping Nikwillig on the shoulder and knocking him silly The terrified horses broke into a gallop and both the injured horse and poor Stokkum broke free of the rig with Stokkum tumbling out onto the stony ground Tred grabbed the reins hard trying to slow the beasts for his poor kinsmen up front were being tugged and dragged along especially Nikwillig who seemed unconscious Another boulder smashed down right behind the bouncing wagon and a third hit the ground before the charging team The horses veered wildly to the left then tried to turn back to the trail on the right putting the wagon up on two wheels Move right Tred ordered but even as he spoke the command the wagons left wheels buckled and the cart crashed down and flipped The horses broke free then taking the harness and the three strapped dwarves on a dead run down the rocky trail The two dwarves behind Tred went flying away and Duggan was hardly aware of itand Tred would have too except that his leg got hooked under the wagon seat He felt the crunch of bone as the wagon came down atop him then he got smacked on the head and hard He thought he had erupted into a bloody mess for a moment as the wagon continued its sidelong roll but he had the fleeting notion that it was ale washing over him Luck alone extracted the dwarf from the crunching catastrophe for he somehow wound up inside that decapitated keg He went bounding and rolling away down the slope of the foothills A rock stopped him abruptly shattering the keg and Tred went into a weird twisting somersault Tough as the stone around him the dwarf struggled to his feet One of his legs gave out under him so he fell forward against the stone stubbornly propping himself up on his elbows He saw them then dozens and dozens of ores waving spears clubs and swords swarming over the destroyed wagon and fallen dwarves A pair of giants followed them down from the higher ground not hill giants as Tred would have expected but larger blueskinned frost giants He knew then that this was no ordinary band of raiders Slipping from consciousness Tred kept enough of his wits about him to throw himself backward falling into a roll down another slope ending hard against another rock beneath a tangle of brambles He tried to stand again but then tasted bloody dirt in his mouth Tred knew no more Well are ye alive or aint ye came a distant gravelly voice Tred opened one eye caked with blood and through a haze saw the battered form of Nikwillig crouched before the brambles and staring in at him Good so ye are said Nikwillig and he slipped his arm in offering Tred a hand Keep your arse low or the pickersll be skinning it good Tred took that hand and squeezed it tightly but did not start out of the tangle Wherere the others he asked Wheres me brother The ores killed em all to death in battle came the grim response and the pigsre not too far away Damned horses dragged me a mile an more Tred didnt let go but neither did he start forward Come on ye dolt Nikwillig scolded We got to get to Shallows and get the word spreadin back to King Warcrown Ye run on Tred replied Me legs all broke Ill slow ye down Bah yere talking like the fool I always knowed ye was Nikwillig gave a great tug dragging Tred right out from under the brambles Bah yerself Tred growled at him And so yed be leaving me if it was th other way around That question hit home Get me a stick ye stubborn old fool Soon after arm in arm with Tred leaning on both Nikwillig and a stick the two hardy dwarves ambled off toward Shallows already plotting their revenge on the ambushing ore band They didnt know that another hundred such bands were out of their mountain holes and roaming the countryside When Thibbledorf Pwent and his small army of battleragers arrived in Icewind Dale with news that Gandalug Battlehammer the First King and Ninth King of Mithral Hall had died I knew that Bruenor would have no choice but to return to his ancestral home and take again the mantle of leadership His duties to the clan would demand no less and for Bruenor as with most dwarves duties to king and clan usurp everything I recognized the sadness on Bruenors face as he heard the news though and knew that little of it was in grieving for the former king Gandalug had lived a long and amazing life more so than any dwarf could ever hope So while he was sad at losing this ancestor he had barely known that wasnt the source of Bruenors long look No what most troubled Bruenor I knew was the duty calling him to return to a settled existence I knew at once that I would accompany him but I knew too that I would not remain for long in the safe confines of Mithral Hall I am a creature of the road of adventure I came to know this after the battle against the drow when Gandalug was returned to Clan Battlehammer Finally it seemed peace had found our little troupe but that I knew so quickly would prove a doubleedged sword And so I found myself sailing the Sword Coast with Captain Deudermont and his piratechasing crew aboard Sea Sprite with Cattibrie at my side It is strange and somewhat unsettling to come to the realization that no place will hold me for long that no home will ever truly suffice I wonder if I am running toward something or away from something Am I driven as were the misguided Entreri and Ellifain These questions reverberate within my heart and soul Why do I feel the need to keep moving For what am I searching Acceptance Some wider reputation that will somehow grant me a renewed assurance that I had chosen well in leaving Menzoberranzan These questions rise up about me and sometimes bring distress but it is not a lasting thing For in looking at them rationally I understand their ridiculousness With Pwent s arrival in Icewind Dale the prospect of settling in the security and comforts of Mithral Hall loomed before us all once more and it is not a life I feel I can accept My fear was for Cattibrie and the relationship we have forged How would it change Would Cattibrie desire to make a home and family of her own Would she see the return to the dwarven stronghold as a signal that she had reached the end of her adventurous road And if so then what would that mean for me Thus we all took the news brought by Pwent with mixed feelings and more than a little trepidation Bruenors conflicted attitude didnt hold for long though A young and fiery dwarf named Dagnabbit one who had been instrumental in freeing Mithral Hall from the duergar those years ago and son of the famous General Dagna the esteemed commander of Mithral Halls military arm had accompanied Pwent to Icewind Dale After Bruenor held a private meeting with Dagnabbit my friend had come out as full of excitement as I had ever seen him practically hopping with eagerness to be on the road home And to the surprise of everyone Bruenor had immediately put forth a special advisementnot a direct order but a heavyhanded suggestionthat all of Mithral Halls dwarves who had settled beneath the shadows of Kelvin s Cairn in Icewind Dale return with him When I asked Bruenor about this apparent change in attitude he merely winked and assured me that Id soon know the greatest adventure of my lifeno small promise He still won t talk about the specifics or even the general goal he has in mind and Dagnabbit is as tightlipped as my irascible friend But in truth the specifics are not so important to me What is important is the assurance that my life will continue to hold adventure purpose and goals That is the secret I believe To continually reach higher is to live to always strive to be a better person or to make the world around you a better place or to enrich your life or the lives of those you love is the secret to that most elusive of goals a sense of accomplishment For some that can be achieved by creating order and security or a sense of home For some including many dwarves it can be achieved by the accumulation of wealth or the crafting of a magnificent item For me Ill use my scimitars And so my feet were light when again we departed Icewind Dale a hearty caravan of hundreds of dwarves a grumbling but far from miserable halfling an adventurous woman a mighty barbarian warrior along with his wife and child and me a pleasantly misguided dark elf who keeps a panther as a friend Let the snows fall deep the rain drive down and the wind buffet my cloak I care not for Ive a road worth walking Drizzt DoUrden ALLIANCE He wore his masterwork plated armor as if it was an extension of his tough skin Not a piece of the interlocking black metal was flat and unadorned with flowing designs and overlapping basreliefs A pair of great curving spikes extended from each upper arm plate and each joint cover had a sharpened and tripointed edge to it The armor itself could be used as a weapon though King Obould ManyArrows preferred the greatsword he always kept strapped to his back a magnificent weapon that could burst into flame at his command Yes the strong and cunning ore loved fire loved the way it indiscriminately ate everything in its path He wore a black iron crown set with four brilliant and enchanted rubies each of which could bring about a mighty fireball He was a walking weapon stout and strong the kind of creature that one wouldnt punch figuring that doing so would do more damage to the attacker than to the attacked Many rivals had been slaughtered by Obould as they stood there hesitating pondering how in the world they might begin to hurt this king among orcs Of all his weapons though Oboulds greatest was his mind He knew how to exploit a weakness He knew how to shape a battlefield and most of all he knew how to inspire those serving him And so unlike so many of his kin Obould walked into Shining White the ice and rock caverns of the mighty frost giantess Gerti Orelsdottr with his eyes up and straight his head held high He had come in as a potential partner not as a lesser Taking his lead Oboulds entourage including his most promising son Urlgen Threefist so named because of the ridged headpiece he wore which allowed him to headbutt as if he had a third fist walked with a proud and confident gait though the ceilings of Shining White were far from comfortably low and many of the blueskinned guards they passed were well more than twice their height and several times their weight Even Oboulds indomitable nature took a bit of a hit though when the frost giant escort led him and his band through a huge set of ironbanded doors into a freezing chamber that was much more ice than stone Against the wall to the right of the doors before a throne fashioned of black stone and blue cloth capped in blue ice stood the giantess the heir apparent of the Jarl leader of the frost giant tribes of the Spine of the World Gerti was beautiful by the measure of almost any race She stood more than a dozen feet tall her blueskinned body shapely and muscled Her eyes a darker shade of blue focused sharp enough to cut ice it seemed and her long fingers appeared both delicate and sensitive and strong enough to crush rock She wore her golden hair longas long as Obould was tall Her cloak fashioned of silver wolf fur was held together by a gemstudded ring large enough for a grown elf to wear as a belt and a collar of huge pointed teeth adorned her neck She wore a dress of brown distressed leather covering her ample bosom then cut to a small flap on one side to reveal her muscled belly and slit up high on her shapely legs giving her freedom of movement Her boots were high and topped with the same silvery furand were also magical or so said every tale It was said they allowed the giantess to quicken her long strides and cover more ground across the mountainous terrain than any but avian creatures Well met Gerti Obould said speaking nearly flawless frost giant He bowed low his plated armor creaking You will address me as Dame Orelsdottr the giantess replied curtly her voice resonant and strong echoing off the stone and ice Dame Orelsdottr Obould corrected with another bow You have heard of the success of our raid yes You killed a few dwarves Gerti said with a snicker and her assembled guards responded in kind I have brought you a gift of that significant victory Significant the giantess said with dripping sarcasm Significant not in the number of enemies slain but in the first success of our joined peoples Obould quickly explained Gertis frown showed that she considered the description of them as joined peoples a bit premature at least which hardly surprised or dismayed Obould The tactics work well Obould went on undaunted He turned and motioned to Urlgen The orc taller than his father but not as thick of limb and torso stepped forward and pulled a large sack off his back bringing it around and spilling its gruesome contents onto the floor Five dwarf heads rolled out including those of the brothers Stokkum and Bokkum and Duggan McKnuckles Gerti crinkled her face and looked away I would hardly call these gifts she said Symbols of victory Obould replied seeming a bit offbalance for the first time in the meeting I have little interest in placing the heads of lesser races upon my walls as trophies Gerti remarked I prefer objects of beauty and dwarves hardly qualify Obould stared at her hard for a moment understanding well that she could easily and honestly have included orcs in that last statement He kept his wits about him though and motioned for his son to gather up the heads and put them back away Bring me the head of Emerus Warcrown of Felbarr Gerti said There is a trophy worthy of keeping Obould narrowed his eyes and bit back his response Gerti was playing him and hard King Obould Many Arrows had once ruled the former Citadel Felbarr until a few years previous when Emerus Warcrown had returned expelling Obould and his clan It remained a bitter loss to Obould what he considered his greatest error for he and his clan had been battling another orc tribe at the time leaving Warcrown and his dwarves an opportunity to retake Felbarr Obould wanted Felbarr back dearly so but Felbarrs strength had grown considerably over the past few years swelling to nearly seven thousand dwarves and those in halls of stone fashioned for defense The orc king fought back his anger with tremendous discipline not wanting Gerti to see the sting produced by her sharp words Or bring me the head of the King of Mithral Hall Gerti went on Whether Gandalug Battlehammer or as rumors now say the beast Bruenor once again Or perhaps the Marchion of Mirabaryes his fat head and fuzzy red beard would make a fine trophy And bring me Mirabars Sceptrana as well Isnt she a pretty thing The giantess paused for a moment and looked around at her amused warriors a wicked grin spreading wide on her finefeatured face You wish to deliver a trophy suitable for Dame Orelsdottr she asked slyly Then fetch me the pretty head of Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon Yes Obould King Obould the proud orc corrected drawing a hush from the frost giant soldiers and a gasp from his sorely outpowered entourage Gerti looked at him hard then nodded her approval They let their banter go at that for both understood the preposterous level it had reached Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon was a target far beyond them Neither would put her and her enchanted city off the extended list of potential enemies though Silverymoon was the jewel of the region Both Gerti Orelsdottr and Obould Many Arrows coveted jewels I am planning the next assault Obould said after the pause again speaking slowly in the strange language forcing his diction and enunciation to perfection Its scope Obould shrugged and shook his head Nothing major Caravan or a town The scope will depend upon our escorting artillery he ended with a sly grin A handful of giants are worth a thousand orcs Gerti replied taking the cue a bit further than Obould would have preferred Still the cunning orc allowed her that boast without refute well aware of her superior attitude and not really concerned about it at that time He needed the frost giants behind his soldiers for diplomatic reasons more than for practical gain My warriors did enjoy plunking the dwarves with their boulders Gerti admitted and the giant to the side of the throne dais who had been on the raid nodded and smiled his agreement Very well King Obould I will spare you four giants for the next fight Send your emissary when you are ready for them Obould bowed ducking his head as he did not wanting Gerti to see his wide grin not wanting her to know how important her additions would truly be to him and his cause He came up straight again and stomped his right boot his signal to his entourage to form up behind him as he turned and left They are your pawns Donnia Soldou said to Gerti soon after Obould and his orc entourage had departed The female dark elf dressed head to toe in deep shades of gray and black moved easily among the frost giants ignoring the threatening scowls many of them assumed whenever she was about Donnia walked with the confidence of the dark elves and with the knowledge that her subtle threats to Gerti concerning bringing an army to wipe out every living creature in the Spine of the World who opposed her had not fallen on deaf ears Such were the often true tactics and pleasures of the dark elves Of course Donnia had nothing at all to back up the claim She was a rogue part of a band that included only four members So when she threw back her cowl and shook her long and thick white hair into its customary place thrown to the side so that the tresses covered half her face including her right eye she did so with an air of absolute certainty Gerti didnt have to know that They are orcs Gerti Orelsdottr replied with obvious disdain They are pawns to any who need to make them so It is not easy to resist the urge to squash Obould into the rock simply for being so ugly simply for being so stupid simply for the pleasure of it Oboulds designs strengthen your own Donnia said His minions are numerous Numerous enough to wreak havoc among the dwarf and human communities of the region but not so overwhelming as to engage the legions of the greater cities like Silverymoon He wants Felbarr so that he can rename it the Citadel of Many Arrows Do you believe that he can take so prosperous a stronghold and not invoke the wrath of Lady Alustriel Did Silverymoon get involved when Oboulds kin sacked Felbarr the last time Donnia gave a chuckle The Lady and her advisors have enough to keep them concerned within their own borders Felbarr will be isolated eventually Perhaps Mithral Hall or even Citadel Adbar will choose to send aid but it will not be substantial if we create chaos in the neighboring mountain ranges and out of the Trollmoors I have little desire to do battle with dwarves in their tiny tunnels the frost giant remarked That is why you have Obould and his thousands The dwarves will slaughter them Donnia smiled and shrugged as if that notion hardly bothered her Gerti started to respond but just nodded her agreement Donnia held her smile thinking that this was going quite well Donnia and her companions had stumbled upon the situation at exactly the right time The old Grayhand Jarl Orel of the frost giants was very near death by all accounts and his daughter was anxious to assume his mantle Gerti was possessed of tremendous hubris for herself and her race She considered frost giants the greatest race of Faerun destined to dominate Her pride and racism exceeded even that Donnia had seen from the matron mothers of her home city Ched Nasad That made Gerti an easy mark indeed How fares the Grayhand Donnia asked wanting to keep Gertis appetite whetted He cannot speak nor would he make any sense if he did His reign is at its end in all ways but formal But you are ready Donnia assured the already selfassured giantess You Dame Gerti Orelsdottr will bring your tribes to the pinnacle of their glory and woe to all of those who stand against you Gerti finally sat down upon her carved throne resting back but with her chin thrust high and strong a pose of supreme pride Donnia kept her smile to herself I hate them damn giants as much as I hate them damn dwarves Urlgen proclaimed when he and the others were out of Gertis caves Id spit in Gertis face if I could reach it You keeps you words to youself Obould scolded You said them giants helped in yous raiddidnt you like their bouncing boulders Think itll be easier like going after dwarf towers without those boulders softening them up Then why is we fighting the damn dwarves another of the group dared to ask Obould spun and punched him in the face laying him low So much for that debate Well lets see how much them giantsll be helping us then Urlgen pressed Lets get them all out on a raid and flatten the buildings aboveground at Mirabar A couple of the others bristled and nodded eagerly at that thought Need I remind you of the course we have chosen came a voice from the side very different from the guttural grunting of the orcs more melodic and musical though hardly less firm The group turned to see Adnon Kareese step out of the shadows and many had to blink to even recognize how completely the drow had been hidden just a moment before Well met Sneak said Obould Adnon bowed taking the compliment in stride We met the big witch Obould started to explain So I heard said the drow and before Obould could begin to elaborate Adnon added All of it The orc king gave a chortle Course yous did Sneak Can get anywhere you wants cant you Anywhere and anytime the drow replied with all confidence Once he had been among the finest scouts of Ched Nasad a thief and assassin with a growing reputation Of course that distinction had eventually led him to an illfated assassination attempt upon a rather powerful priestess and the resulting fallout had put Adnon on the road out of the city and out of the Underdark Over the past twenty years he and his Ched Nasad associates fellow assassin Donnia Soldou the priestess Kaerlic Suun Wett and the newcomer a clever fellow named Tosun Armgo sent astray in the disastrous Menzoberranzan raid on Mithral Hall had found more fun and games on the surface than ever they had known in their respective cities and more freedom In Ched Nasad and in Menzoberranzan the four had been hireons and pawns for the greater powers except for Kaerlic who had been fashioning a mighty reputation among the priestesses of the Spider Queen before disaster had blocked her path Up among the lesser races the four acted with impunity ever with the threat that they were the advance for great drow armies ready to sweep in and eliminate all foes Even proud Obould and prouder Gerti Orelsdottr would shift uncomfortably in their respective seats at the slightest hint of that catastrophe So we push up that course a bit Urlgen argued against the drow Choice aint youses Sneak Choice is Oboulds And Gertis the drow reminded Bah we can fool the witch easy enough Urlgen declared and the others nodded and grunted their agreement Fool her into bringing about complete destruction for her designs and for your fathers the drow calmly replied ending the cheering session Adnon looked at Obould as he continued Small forays alone for a long while You asked my opinion and I have not wavered on it for a moment Small forays and with restraint We draw them out little by little That might be taking years Urlgen protested Adnon nodded conceding the point The minor skirmishes are expected and even accepted as an unavoidable byproduct of the environment by all the folk of the region he explained as he had so often in the past A caravan intercepted here a village sacked there and none will get overly excited for none will understand the scope of it You can tickle the gold sacks of the dwarves but prod your spear too deeply move them beyond a reasonable response and you will unite the tribes He stared hard at Obould and continued You will awaken the beast Think of the three dwarf strongholds joined in alliance supplying each other with goods weapons and even soldiers through their connecting tunnels Think of the battle you will face in reclaiming the Citadel of Many Arrows if Adbar lends them several thousand shield dwarves and Mithral Hall outfits them all in the finest of metals Why Mithral Hall is the smallest of the three yet she fended the army of Menzoberranzan His emphasis on that last word a name to strike terror into the hearts of any who were not of Menzoberranzanand in the hearts of a good many who were of the cityhad a couple of the orcs shuddering visibly And through it all we must take care wise Obould not to invoke the wrath of Silverymoon whose Lady is a friend to Mithral Hall the drow advisor went on And we must never allow an alliance to form between Mithral Hall and Mirabar Bah Mirabar hates them newcomers True enough but they do not fear the newcomer dwarves in any but economic ways Adnon explained They will fear you and Gerti with their very lives and such fear makes for unexpected alliances Like the one between me and Gerti Adnon considered that for a moment then shook his head No you and Gerti understand that youll both move closer to your goals by allying You are not afraid of course Course not Nor should you be Play the game as weve discussed as you and I have planned it all along my friend Obould He moved closer and whispered so that only the orc king could hear Show why you are above the others of your race why you alone might gather a strong enough alliance to reclaim your rightful citadel Obould straightened and nodded then turned to his kinfolk and recited the litany that Adnon had taught him for months and months Patience Ill not even bother to ask how your parlay with Obould progressed priestess Kaerlic Suun Wett remarked when Adnon finally arrived at the comfortable richly adorned chamber off a deep deep tunnel below the southernmost spurs of the Spine of the World not far from the caverns of Shining White though much deeper Kaerlic was the most striking member of the group Heavyset which was very unusual for a dark elf and with broad shoulders Kaerlic had lost her right eye in a battle when she was a young priestess nearly a century before Rather than have the orb magically restored the stubborn Kaerlic had replaced it with a black manychambered eye pried from the carcass of a giant spider She claimed the orb was functional and allowed her to see things that others could not but her three friends knew the truth of it Many times Adnon and Donnia had sneaked up on Kaerlics right side completely undetected for no better reason than to tease her Still the two assassins had gone along with Kaerlics ruse to their newest companion for many tendays Spiders after all made quite an impact on dark elves from Menzoberranzan and Tosun Armgo had remained suitably impressed for a long time until Adnon had finally let him in on the ruseand that only after the three longterm friends had come to understand that Tosun was one who could be trusted Adnon shrugged in response to Kaerlics remarks telling the other three that it had gone exactly as they would all expect when dealing with an orc Indeed Obould was more cunning than his kind but that wasnt really saying much by drow standards Dame Gerti holds the course as well Donnia added She believes it to be her destiny to rule the Spine of the World and will follow any course that may lead her to that place She might be right Tosun put in Gerti Orelsdottr is a smart one and between Oboulds masses and the stirring trolls from the moors enough chaos might be created for Gerti to step forward And we will be ready to profit in material and in pleasure whatever the outcome Donnia said with a wry grin one that was matched by her three friends It amazes me that I ever considered returning to Menzoberranzan Tosun Armgo remarked and the others laughed Donnia and Adnon were staring rather intently at each other when that laughter abated The lovers had been apart for several days after all and both of them found such talk of conquest chaos and profit quite stimulating They practically ran out of the chamber to their private room Kaerlic howled with renewed laughter as they departed shaking her head She was always more pragmatic about such needs never reducing them to overpowering levels as the two assassins often did They will die in each others arms she remarked to Tosun coupling and oblivious to the threat There are worse ways to go I suppose the son of House Barrison DelArmgo replied and Kaerlic laughed again These two were parttime lovers as well but only part time and not for a long long time Kaerlic wasnt really interested in a partner in truth far preferring a slave to use as a toy We should expand these raids to the Moonwood she remarked lewdly Perhaps we could convince Obould to capture us a couple of young moon elves A couple Tosun said skeptically A handful would be more fun Kaerlic laughed yet again Tosun leaned back into the thick furs of his divan wondering again how he could have ever even considered returning to the dangers discomforts and subjugation that he as a male could not avoid along the dark avenues of Menzoberranzan NOT WELCOME The wind howled down at them from the peaks to the north the towering snowcapped Spine of the World Mountains Just a bit farther to the south along the roads out of Luskan spring was in full bloom fast approaching summer but at the higher elevations the wind was rarely warm and the going rarely easy Yet it was precisely this course that Bruenor Battlehammer had chosen as the route back to Mithral Hall walking east within the shadow of the mountains They had left Icewind Dale without incident for none of the highwaymen or solitary monsters that often roamed the treacherous roads would challenge an army of nearly five hundred dwarves A storm had caught them in the pass through the mountains but Bruenors hearty people had trudged on turning east even as Drizzt and his other unsuspecting friends were expecting to soon see the towers of Luskan in the south before them Drizzt had asked Bruenor about the unexpected course change for though this was a more direct route it certainly wouldnt be much quicker and certainly not less hazardous In reply to the logical question Bruenor had merely snorted Yell see soon enough elf The days blended into tendays and the raucous hand put more than a hundred and fifty difficult miles behind them Their days were full of dwarven marching songs their nights full of dwarven partying songs To the surprise of Drizzt Cattibrie and Wulfgar Bruenor moved Regis by his side soon after the eastward turn The dwarf was constantly leaning in and talking to the halfling while Regis bobbed his head in reply Whats the little one know that we dont Cattibrie asked the drow as they flanked the caravan to the north looking back on the third wagon Bruenors wagon to see Bruenor and Regis engaged in one such discussion Drizzt just shook his head not really sure of how to read Regis at all anymore Well Im thinking we should find out Cattibrie added seeing no response forthcoming When Bruenor wants us to know all the details he will tell us Drizzt assured her but her smirk made it fairly clear that she wasnt buying into that theory Weve turned the both of them from more than one illaimed scheme she reminded Are ye hoping to find out right before the cataclysm The logic was simple enough and in considering the pair on the wagon and the fact that raucous and nonetoobrilliant Thibbledorf Pwent was also serving Bruenor in an advisory position the drow could only chuckle And what are we to do Well hot pokers wont get Bruenor talking even against a birthday surprise Cattibrie reasoned but Im thinking that Regis has a bit lower tolerance For pain Drizzt asked incredulously Or for tricks or for drink or for whatever else might work the woman explained Think Ill be getting Wulfgar to carry the little rat to us when Bruenors off about other business tonight Drizzt gave a helpless laugh understanding well the perils that awaited poor Regis and glad that Bruenor had taken the halfling into his confidence and not him As with most nights Drizzt and Cattibrie set a camp off to the side of the gathering of dwarves keeping watch and even more than that keeping a bit of their sanity aside from Thibbledorf Pwents antics and the Gutbusters training Pwent did come over and join the pair this night though walking right in and plopping down on a boulder to the side of their fire He looked at Cattibrie even reached up to touch her long auburn hair Ah yere looking good girl he said and he dropped a sack of some muddy compound at her feet Ye be putting that on yer face each night afore ye go to sleep Cattibrie looked down at the sack and its slimy contents then up at Drizzt who was sitting on a log and resting back against a rock facing his hands tucked behind his head brushing wide his thick shock of white hair so that it framed his blackskinned face and his purple eyes Clearly the battlerager amused him On me face Cattibrie asked and Pwents head bobbed eagerly Let me guess It will make me grow a beard Good and thick one said Pwent Red to match yer hair Im hoping Oh a fiery one yell be Cattibries eyes narrowed as she looked over at Drizzt once more to see him choking back a chuckle Make sure yere not putting it up too high on yer cheeks girl the battlerager went on and now Drizzt did laugh out loud Yell look like that durned Harpell werewolf critter As he finished the thought Pwent sighed and rolled his eyes longingly It was well known that the battlerager had begged Bidderdoo Harpell the werewolf to bite him so that he too might be afflicted by the ferocious disease The Harpell had wisely refused Before the wild dwarf could continue the trio heard a movement to the side and a huge form appeared It was Wulfgar the barbarian nearly seven feet tall with a broad and muscled chest He was wearing a beard to match his blond hair but it was neatly trimmed showing the renewed signs of care that had given all the friends hope that Wulfgar had at last overcome his inner demons Ho carried a large sack over one shoulder and something inside of it was squirming Hey whatcha got there boy Pwent howled hopping up and bending in curiously Dinner Wulfgar replied The creature in the sack moaned and squirmed more furiously Pwent rubbed his hands together eagerly and licked his lips Only enough for us Wulfgar said to him Sorry Bah ye can spare me a leg Just enough for us Wulfgar said again putting his hand on Pwents forehead and pushing the dwarf back to arms length And for me to bring some leftovers to my wife and child You will have to go and dine with your kin I fear Bah the battlerager snorted Ye aint even kilt it right With that he stepped up and balled his fist retracting his arm for a devastating punch No Drizzt Wulfgar and Cattibrie all yelled together The woman and the drow leaped up and rushed in to intercept Wulfgar spinning aside put himself between the battlerager and the sack As he did though the sack swung out wide and bounced off the rock facing drawing another groan from within Were wanting it fresh Cattibrie explained to the befuddled battlerager Fresh Its still kicking Cattibrie rubbed her hands together eagerly and licked her lips mimicking Pwents initial reaction It is indeed she said happily Pwent backed off a step and put his hands firmly on his hips staring hard at the woman then he exploded into laughter Yell make a good dwarf girl he howled He slapped his hands against his thighs and bounded away back down the slope toward the main encampment As soon as he was gone Wulfgar swung the sack over his shoulder and bent low gently spilling its contents one very irate slightly overweight halfling dressed in fine traveling clothes a red shirt brown vest and breeches Regis rolled on the ground quickly regained his footing and frantically brushed himself off Your pardon Wulfgar offered as graciously as he could while stifling a laugh Regis glared up at him then hopped over and kicked him hard in the shinwhich of course hurt Regiss bare toes more than it affected the mighty barbarian Relax my friend Drizzt bade him stepping over and draping his arm over the halflings shoulder We needed to speak with you that is all And asking is beyond your comprehension Regis was quick to point out Drizzt shrugged It had to be done secretly he explained Even as the words left his mouth Regis began to shrink back apparently catching on Ye been talking a lot with Bruenor of late Cattibrie piped in and Regis shrank back even more Were thinking that ye should be sharing some of his words with us Oh no Regis replied patting his hands in the air before him warding them away Bruenors got his plans spinning and he will tell you when he wants you to know Then there is something Drizzt reasoned He is returning to Mithral Hall to become the king the halfling replied That is something indeed Something more than that said Drizzt I see it clearly in his eyes in the bounce of his step Regis shrugged Hes glad to be going home Oh is that where were going Cattibrie asked You are T am going farther the halfling admitted To the Heralds Holdfast he explained referring to a renowned library tower located east of Mithral Hall and northwest of Silverymoon a place the friends had visited years before when they were trying to locate Mithral Hall so that Bruenor could reclaim the place Bruenor has asked me to gather some information for him About what asked the drow Gandalug and Gandalugs time mostly Regis answered and while it seemed to the other three that he was speaking truthfully they also sensed that he was speaking incompletely And what might Bruenor be needing that for asked Cattibrie Im thinking thats a question ye should be asking Bruenor came the gruff reply of a familiar voice and all four turned to see Bruenor stride into the firelight Ye go grabbing Rumblebelly there when all ye had to do was ask meself And yed be telling us Cattibrie asked No said the dwarf and three sets of eyes narrowed immediately Bah Bruenor recanted Hoping to surprise ye three is hoping for the impossible Surprise us with what asked Wulfgar An adventure boy the dwarf howled As great an adventure as yeve ever knowed Ive known a few Drizzt warned and Bruenor howled Sit yerselfs down the dwarf bade them motioning to the fire and all five sat in a circle about the blaze Bruenor pulled a bulging pack off his back After dropping it to the ground he pulled it open to reveal packets of food and bottles of ale and wine Though yere fancying fresher food he said with a wink to Cattibrie I was thinking thisd do for now They sorted out the meal and Bruenor hardly waited for them to begin eating before he launched into his tale telling them that he was truly glad they had pressed the issue for it was a tale a promise of adventure that he desperately wanted to share Well be making the mouth o the Valley of Khedrun tomorrow he explained Then were turning south across the vale to the River Mirabar and to Mirabar herself Mirabar Cattibrie and Drizzt echoed in unison and with equal skepticism It was hardly a secret that the mining city of Mirabar was no supporter of Mithral Hall which threatened their business interests Yere knowing Dagnabbit Bruenor asked and the friends all nodded Well hes a few friends there wholl be giving us some information that were wanting to hear The dwarf paused and hopped up glancing all around into the darkness as if searching for spies Ye got yer cat about elf the redbearded dwarf asked Drizzt shook his head Well get her here if ye can Bruenor bade him Send her out about and tell her to drag in any who might overhear Drizzt looked to Cattibrie and to Wulfgar then reached into his belt pouch and brought forth an onyx figurine of a panther Guenhwyvar he called softly Come to me friend A gray mist began to swirl around the figurine growing and thickening gradually mirroring the shape of the idol The mist solidified quickly and the huge black panther Guenhwyvar stood there quietly and patiently waiting for Drizzts instructions The drow bent low and whispered into the panthers ear and Guenhwyvar bounded away disappearing into the blackness Bruenor nodded Them Mirabar boysre mad about Mithral Hall he said which wasnt news to any of them Theyre looking for a way to get back an advantage in the mining trade The dwarf looked around again then bent in very close motioning for a huddle Theyre looking for Gauntlgrym he whispered What is that Wulfgar asked Cattibrie looked equally perplexed though Drizzt was nodding as if it was all perfectly logical The ancient stronghold of the dwarves Bruenor explained Back afore Mithral Hall Citadel Felbarr and Citadel Adbar Back when we were one big clan back when we named ourselves the Delzoun Gauntlgrym was lost centuries ago Drizzt put in Many centuries ago Beyond the memory of any living dwarves True enough Bruenor said with a wink Now that Gandalugs gone to the Halls of Moradin Drizzts eyes widened so did those of Cattibrie and Wulfgar Gandalug knew of Gauntlgrym the drow asked Never saw it for it fell afore he was born Bruenor explained But he added quickly as the hopeful smiles began to fade when he was a lad the tales of Gauntlgrym were fresher in the mouths o dwarves He looked at each of his friends in turn nodding knowingly Them Mirabar boysre looking for it under the Crags to the south Theyre looking in the wrong place How much did Gandalug know Cattibrie asked Not much more than I knew about Mithral Hall when first we went a lookin Bruenor admitted with a snort Less even But itll be an adventure worth making if were finding the city O the treasures I tell ye And metal as good as anything yeve eer seen He went on and on about the legendary crafted pieces of the Gauntlgrym dwarves about weapons of great power armor that could turn any blade and shields that could stop dragonfire Drizzt wasnt really listening to the specifics though he was watching every movement from the fiery dwarf By the drows estimation the adventure would be well worth the risks and hardships whether or not they ever found Gauntlgrym He hadnt seen Bruenor this animated and excited in years not since the first foray to find Mithral Hall As he looked around at the others he saw the eager gleam in Cattibrie s green eyes and the sparkle in Wulfgars icy blue orbsfurther confirmation to him that his barbarian friend was well on the road to recovery from the trauma of spending six years at the clawed hands of the demon Errtu The fact that Wulfgar had taken on the responsibilities of husband and father Delly and the baby never far from him even in their present camp was all the more reassuring Even Regis who had no doubt heard this tale many times already along the road leaned in drawn to the dwarfs tales of dungeons deep and treasures magical It occurred to Drizzt that he should ask Bruenor why they all had to go to Mirabar where they wouldnt likely be welcomed Couldnt Dagnabbit go in alone or with a small group less conspicuously The drow held his thoughts though understanding it well enough He hadnt been with Bruenor in Icewind Dale when the first reports of antagonism from Mirabar had been sent to him from King Gandalug He and Cattibrie had been sailing the Sword Coast at that time but when they had found Bruenor back in Icewind Dale the dwarf had pointed it out more than once a simmering source of anger Openly the Council of Sparkling Stones the ruling council of Mirabar comprised of dwarves and men spoke warmly of Mithral Hall welcoming their brothers of Clan Battlehammer back to the region Privately though Bruenor had heard over the years many reports of more subtle derogatory comments from sources close to the Council of Sparkling Stones and Elastul the Marchion of Mirabar Some of the plots that had caused Gandalug headaches had been traced back to Mirabar Bruenor was going there for no better reason than to look some of the folk of Mirabar straight in the eye to make a proclamation that the Eighth King of Mithral Hall had returned as the Tenth King and he was one a bit more clued in to the subterfuge of the present day politics of the wild north Drizzt just sat back and watched his friends continuing huddle The adventure had begun it seemed and it was one the drow believed he would truly enjoy Or would he For something else occurred to Drizzt then a memory quite unexpected He recalled his first visit to the surface a supposed great adventure alongside his fellow dark elves Images of the slaughter of the surface elves swirled through his thoughts culminating in the memory of a little elf girl he had smeared with her own mothers blood to make it appear as if she too had been mortally wounded He had saved her that terrible day and that massacre had in truth been the first real steps for Drizzt away from his vile kinfolk And all these years later he had killed that same elf child He winced as he saw Ellifain again across the room in the pirate cavern complex mortally wounded and pleased by the thought that in sacrificing herself she had taken Drizzt with her On a logical level the drow could surely understand that nothing that had happened that day was his fault that he could not have foreseen the torment that would follow that rescued child all these decades But on another level a deeper level the fateful fight with the anguished Ellifain had struck a deep chord within Drizzt DoUrden He had left Icewind Dale full of anticipation for the open road and indeed he was glad to be with his friends traveling the wilds full of adventure and excitement But the keen edge of a purpose beyond material gain beyond finding ancient kingdoms and ancient treasure had been dulled Drizzt had never fancied himself a major player in the events of the wider world He had contented himself in the knowledge that his actions served those around him in a positive way From his earliest days in Menzoberranzan he had held an innate understand of the fundamental differences between good and evil and he had always believed that he was a player for the side of justice and goodness But what of Ellifain He continued to listen to the excited talk around him and held fast his consenting smile assuring himself that he would indeed enjoy this newest adventure He had to believe that There was nothing pretty about the open air city of Mirabar Squat stone buildings and a few towers sat inside a square stone wall Everything about the place spoke of efficiency and control a nononsense approach to getting their work done To the sensibilities of a dwarf like Bruenor that made Mirabar a place to be admired to a point but to Drizzt and Cattibrie as they approached the citys northern gate Mirabar seemed an unadorned blotch uninteresting and unremarkable Give me Silverymoon Drizzt remarked to the woman as they walked along to the left of the dwarven caravan Even Menzoberranzans a prettier sight Cattibrie replied and Drizzt could only agree The guards at the north gate seemed an apt reflection of Mirabars dour attitude Four humans stood in pairs on opposite ends of sturdy metallic doors halberds set on the ground and held vertically before them silver armor gleaming in the early morning sun Bruenor recognized the crest emblazoned on their tower shields the royal badge of Mirabar a deep red doublebladed axe with a pointed haft and a flaring flat base set on a black field The approach of a huge caravan of dwarves a veritable army surely shook them all but to their credit they held their posture perfect eyes straight ahead faces impassive Bruenor brought his wagon around moving to the front of the caravan Pwents Gutbusters running to keep their protective guard to either flank Bring her right up afore em Bruenor instructed his driver Dagnabbit The younger ye Howbearded dwarf gave a gaptoothed grin and urged his team on faster but the Mirabar guards didnt blink The wagon skidded to a stop short of the closed doors and Bruenor stood up tall relatively speaking and put his hands on his hips State your business State your name came a curt instruction from the inner guard on the right Me business is with yer Council o Sparkling Stones Bruenor answered Ill be tellin it to them alone You will answer the appointed gate guard of Mirabar visitor the inner guard on the left hand side of the doors demanded Ye think Bruenor asked And yere wantin me name Bruenor Battlehammers the name ye durned fool King Bruenor Battlehammer Now ye go and run that name to yer council and well be seeing if theyre to talk to me or not The guards tried to hold their posture and calm demeanor but they did glance over at each other hastily Ye heared o me Bruenor asked them Ye heared o Mithral Hall A moment later one of the guards turned to the guard standing beside him and nodded and that man produced a small horn from his belt and blew a series of short sharp notes A few moments later a smaller hatch cunningly cut into the large portals banged open and a toughlooking manyscarred dwarf wearing a full suit of battered plate mail ambled out He too wore the badge of the city emblazoned on his breastplate as he carried no shield Ah now were getting somewhere Bruenor remarked And it does me old heart good to see that yeve a dwarf for a boss Might be that ye re not as stupid as ye look Well met King Bruenor the dwarf said Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker at yer service He bowed low his black beard sweeping the ground Well met Torgar Bruenor replied offering a gracious bow of his own something that he as head of a nearby kingdom was certainly not required to do Yer guards here serve ye well at blocking the way and better as fodder Trained em meself Torgar responded Bruenor bowed again Were tired and dirty though the last part aint so bad and looking for a nights stay Might ye be opening the doors for us Torgar leaned to one side and the other taking a good look at the caravan shaking his head doubtfully His eyes went wide and he shook his head more vehemently when he glanced to his right to see a human woman standing off to the side beside a drow elf That aint gonna happen the dwarf cried pointing a stubby finger Drizzts way Bah ye heared o that one and ye know ye have Bruenor scolded The name Drizzt ringing any bells in yer thick skull It is or it aint and it aint making no difference anyway Torgar argued No damned drow elfs walkin into me city Not while Im the Topside Commander of the Axe of Mirabar Bruenor glanced over at Drizzt who merely smiled and bowed deferentially Not fair but fair enough so hes stayin out Bruenor agreed What about me and me kin Wherere we to put five hunnerd o ye Torgar asked sincerely correctly estimating the forces size He held his large hands out helplessly to the side Could send a bunch to the mines if we let anyone into the mines And that we dont Fair enough Bruenor replied How many can ye take Twenty yerself included Torgar answered Then twenty itll be Bruenor glanced at Thibbledorf Pwent and nodded Just three o yers he ordered and me and Dagnabbit makes five and well be adding Rumblebelly He paused and looked at Torgar Ye got any arguing to do about me bringing a halfling Torgar shrugged and shook his head Then Rumblebelly makes six Bruenor said to Dagnabbit and Pwent Tell th others to pick fourteen merchants wanting to go in with some goods Better to take me whole brigade Pwent argued but Bruenor was hearing none of it The last thing Bruenor wanted in this already tenuous circumstance was to turn a group of Gutbuster battleragers loose on Mirabar In that event Mithral Hall and Mirabar would likely be at open war before the sun set Ye pick the two goin with ye if yere planning on going Bruenor explained to Pwent and be quick about it A short while later Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker led the twenty dwarves through Mirabar s strong gate Bruenor walked at the front of the column right beside Torgar looking every bit the roadwise adventurehardened King of Mithral Hall spoken of throughout the land He kept his manynotched singlebladed axe strapped on his back but prominently displayed atop the foaming mug shield that was also strapped there He wore his helmet with one horn broken away like a badge of courage He was a king but a dwarf king a creature of pragmatism and action not a flowered and prettily dressed ruler like those common among the humans and elves So whos yer marchion these days he asked Torgar as they crossed into the city Torgars eyes widened Elastul Raurym he replied though its no name ye need be thinking of Ye tell him Im wanting to talk with him Bruenor explained and Torgars eyes widened even more Hes fillin his meetings for the spring in the fall for the summer in the winter Torgar explained Ye cant just walk in and get an audience Bruenor fixed the dwarf with a strong stern gaze Im not gettin an audience he corrected Im granting one Now ye go and get a message to the marchion that Im here for the talking if hes got anything worth hearing The sudden change in Bruenors demeanor now that the gates were behind him clearly unsettled Torgar His offbalance surprise fast shifted to a grim posture eyes narrowing and staring hard at his fellow dwarf Bruenor matched that staremore than matched it Ye go an tell him he said calmly And ye tell yer council and that fool Sceptrana that I telled ye to tell him Protocol Is for humans elves and gnomes Bruenor interrupted his voice stern I aint no human I sure aint no elf and Im no bearded gnome Dwarf to dwarf Im talking here If yerself came to me Mithral Hall and said ye needed to see me yed be seeing me dont ye doubt He finished with a nod and dropped his hand hard on Torgars shoulder That little gesture more than anything previous seemed to put the sturdy warrior at ease He nodded his expression grim as if he had just been reminded of something very important Ill be telling him he agreed or at least Til be tellin his Hammers to be tellin him Bruenor smirked at that and Torgar shuffled Against the obvious disdain of the dwarf King of Mithral Hall the inaccessibility of the Marchion of Mirabar to one of his trusted shield dwarf commanders did indeed seem a bit trite Ill be tellin him Torgar said again with a bit more conviction He led the twenty visitors away then to a place where they could stay the night a large and unremarkable stone house with several sparsely furnished rooms Ye can set up yer wagons and goods right outside Torgar explained Manyll be comin to see ye Im sure specially for them little white trinkets ye got He pointed to one of the three wagons that had come in with the visitors its side panels tinkling with many trinkets as it bounced along the rough ground Scrimshaw Bruenor explained Carved from knucklehead trout Me little friend heres good at it He motioned to Regis who blushed and nodded Ye make any of the stuff on the wagon Torgar asked the half ling and the dwarf seemed genuinely interested A few pieces Ye show me in the morning Torgar asked Might that Ill buy a few With that he nodded and left them heading off to deliver Bruenors invitation to the marchion You turned him over quite well Regis remarked Bruenor looked at him He was ready for a fight when we first arrived the halfling observed Now I believe hes thinking of leaving with us when we go It was an exaggeration of course but not ridiculously so Bruenor just smiled He had heard from Dagnabbit of many curses and threats being hurled against Mithral Hall from Mirabar and surprisingly or not so when he thought about it more seemed to be coming from the dwarves of Mirabar than from the humans That was why Bruenor had insisted on coming to this city where so many of his kinfolk were living in conditions and climate much more fitting to human sensibilities than to a dwarfs Let them see a true dwarf king a legend of their people come to life Let them hear the words and ways of Mithral Hall Maybe then many of Mirabars dwarves would stop whispering curses against Mithral Hall Maybe then the dwarves of Mirabar would remember their heritage Its troubling ye that they wouldnt let ye in Cattibrie remarked to Drizzt a short time later the two of them on a high bluff to the east of the remaining dwarves and the caravan overlooking the city of Mirabar Drizzt turned to regard her curiously and saw sympathy etched on his dear friends face He realized that Cattibrie was reacting to his own wistful expression No he assured her There are some things I know I can never change and so I accept them as they are Yer face is saying different Drizzt forced a smile Not so he saidconvincingly he thought But Cattibries returning look showed him that she saw better The woman stepped back and nodded catching on Yere thinking of the elf she reasoned Drizzt looked away back toward Mirabar and said I wish we could have saved her Were all wishing that I wish you had given the potion to her and not to me Aye and Bruenor wouldve killed me Cattibrie said She grabbed the drow and made him look back at her a smile widening on her pretty face Is that what yere hoping Drizzt couldnt resist her charm and the muchneeded levity It is just difficult he explained There are times when I so wish that things could be different that tidy and acceptable endings could find every tale So ye keep trying to make them endings acceptable Cattibrie said to him Its all ye can do True enough Drizzt admitted to himself He gave a great sigh and looked back to Mirabar and thought again of Ellifain Dagnabbit went out later that afternoon the sun setting and a cold wind kicking up through the streets of the city He didnt return until right before the dawn and spent the day inside with Bruenor discussing the political intrigue of the city and the implications to Mithral Hall while the merchants and Regis worked their wagons outside Not many came to those wagons a few dwarves and fewer humans and most of those who did bargained for deals so poor that the Clan Battlehammer dwarves ultimately refused The lone exception arrived soon after highsun Well show me yer work halfling Torgar bade Regis A dozen heads those of Torgars friends bobbed eagerly behind him Regis the halfling explained extending his hand which Torgar took in a firm and friendly shake Show me Regis the dwarf said Me and me friendsll need a bit o convincing to be spendin our gold pieces on anything ye cant drink That brought a laugh from all the dwarves Battlehammer and Mirabarran alike and from Regis The halfling was wondering if he should consider using his enchanted ruby necklace with its magical powers of persuasion to convince the dwarves of a good deal He dismissed that thought almost immediately though reminding himself of how stubborn some dwarves could be against any kind of magic Regis also considered the implications on the relationship between Mithral Hall and Mirabar should he get caught Still soon enough it became apparent to Regis that he wouldnt need the pendants influence The dwarves had come well stocked with coin and many of their friends joined them The goods on the wagons Regiss work and many other items began to disappear From the window of the house Bruenor and Dagnabbit watched the bazaar with growing satisfaction as dozens and dozens of new patrons almost exclusively dwarves followed Torgars lead They also noted with a mixture of apprehension and hope the grim faces of those others nearby humans mostly looking upon the eager and animated trading with open disdain Im thinking that yeve knocked a wedge down the middle o Mirabar by coming here Dagnabbit observed Might be that fewer cursesll flow from the lips o the dwarfs here when were on the road out And more curses than everll be flowing from the mouths o the humans Bruenor added and he seemed quite pleased by that prospect Quite pleased indeed A short while later Torgar carrying a bag full of purchases knocked on the door Yere coming to tell me that yer marchions too busy Bruenor said as he answered the knock pulling the door open wide Hes got his own business it seems Torgar confirmed Bet he didnt answer yer knock Dagnabbit remarked from behind Bruenor Torgar shrugged helplessly How about yerself Bruenor asked And yer boys Ye got yer own business or ye got time to come in and share some drink Got no coins left Didnt ask for none Torgar chewed his lip a bit I cant be speaking as a representative o Mirabar he explained Who asked ye to Bruenor was quick to reply A good dwarfs putting more into his mouth than hes spilling out Ye got some tales to tell that I aint heared to be sure Thats more than worth the price o some ale And so with Torgars agreement they had a party that night in the unremarkable stone house on the windswept streets of Mirabar More than a hundred Mirabarran dwarves made an appearance with most staying for some time and many sleeping right there on the floor Bruenor wasnt surprised to find the house surrounded by armed grimfaced soldiers humans not dwarves when daylight broke It was lime for Bruenor and his friends to go Torgar and his buddies would find a bit of trouble over this no doubt but when Bruenor looked back at him with concern the tough old veteran merely winked and grinned Ye find yer way to Mithral Hall Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker Bruenor called back to him as the wagons began to roll back out the gates Ye bring all the friends ye want and all the tales ye can tell Well find enough food and drink to make ye belch and a warm bed for as long as ye want to warm yer butt in it No one on the caravan from Icewind Dale missed the scowls the human guards offered at those dangerous remarks You do like to cause trouble dont you Regis said to Bruenor The marchion was too busy for me eh Bruenor replied with a smirk Hell be wishing he met with me dont ye doubt Drizzt Cattibrie and Wulfgar linked up with Bruenors wagon when it and the others had rejoined the bigger caravan outside the city gates What happened in there the dark elf asked A bit o intrigue a bit o fun Bruenor replied and a bit o insurance that if Mirabar eer decides to openly fight against Mithral Hall theyll be missing a few hunnerd o their shorter warriors RETREAT INTO VICTORY Ye gotta keep running Nikwillig scolded Tred The wounded dwarf was slumped against a boulder sweat pouring down his forehead and cheek a grimace of pain on his face as he favored his torn leg Got me in the knee Tred explained gasping between every syllable Shes not holding me up no more Ye run on and Ill give them puppies reason to pause Nikwillig nodded not in agreement of the whole proposal but in determination concerning the last part Ye cant run then well stop and fight he answered Bah Tred snorted at him Bunch o worgs coming Bunch o dead worgs then Nikwillig answered with as much grit and determination as Tred had ever witnessed from him Nikwillig was a merchant more than a warrior but now he was showing his dwarf as the old expression went And in viewing this transformation despite their desperate situation Tred couldnt help but smile Certainly if the situation had been reversed with Nikwillig favoring a torn leg Tred would never have considered leaving him Were needin a plan then said Tred One using fire Nikwillig agreed and as he finished a notsodistant howl split the air and was answered several times Still in that chorus both dwarves found a bit of hope Theyre not coming in all together Tred reasoned Scattered Nikwillig agreed An hour later with the howling much closer Tred sat beside a roaring fire his burly arms crossed before him his singlebladed pointytipped axe set across his lap His leg was glad of the reprieve and his tapping foot alone betrayed his patient posture as he waited for the first of the worgs to make its appearance Off to the side in the shadows behind a pile of boulders an occasional crackle sounded Tred winced and bit his bottom lip hoping the rope held long enough against the weight of the withered but not yet felled pine When the first red eyes appeared across the way Tred began to whistle He reached to the side and scooped up a large pail of water dumping it over himself Ye likin yer meat wet puppies he called to the worgs As the huge wolves leaped into sight he kicked at the closest edge of the fire sending sparks and burning brands their way momentarily stopping them The action brought a cry of pain from the dwarf as well His torn leg could not hold him as he kicked out with the good one and he went tumbling down to the side The chopped dead tree came tumbling too along the line the cunning dwarves had planned The dried out old pine fell into the blazing fire the wind of its descent sending sparks and dry needles rushing out to the side More than one stung poor Tred even igniting his beard a bit He slapped the flickers out stubbornly growled against his agony and forced himself into a defensive posture Across the way the rushing flames bit at the handful of worgs that had stepped into the clearing sending them yelping and scrambling away biting at sparking bits of fur More came on some even getting bit by the frenzy of their companions The dried pine went up in a fiery blaze between Tred and the wolves but not before several dark forms leaped across or circumvented it Hands low on the handle Tred slashed his axe across batting aside the first flying wolf and sending it spinning to the ground He reversed quickly sliding his lead hand up the axe handle and setting it against his belt As the second wolf leaped at him it skewered itself on the axes pointy tip Tred didnt even try to slow that momentum just held the flying wolf up high guiding it over him He brought his axe back at once a ferocious downward chop that got the third charging worg right atop the head smashing and splitting its skull driving its front end down to the stone with its forelegs splaying out wide Nikwillig was beside him sword in hand When the next two worgs approached one from either side the dwarves turned back to back and fended the attacks Frustrated the worgs circled Nikwillig pulled a dagger from his belt and sent it flying into one worgs flank The creature yelped and rushed off into the shadows Its companion quickly followed First rounds ours Tred said shying back as the heat from the burning tree became more intense That packs not wanting more of a fight Nikwillig reasoned but morell be catching us dont ye doubt He started away pulling Tred along Just out of the clearing though Tred stood taller and held his companion back Unless were catching them first Tred said into Nikwilligs puzzled expression when the merchant turned back to regard him Orcsre guiding the worgs Tred reasoned No more orcs no more worgs Nikwillig considered his friend for a few moments looking mostly at Treds torn leg a clear indication that the pair could not hope to outdistance their pursuit That seemed to leave only two choices before them And the first leaving Tred behind simply was not an option Lets go find us some orcs Nikwillig offered His smile was genuine So was Treds They moved along as swiftly as they could backtracking in a roundabout manner through the dark trees and rocky outcroppings scrambling over uneven ground when they could find no trail More often than not Nikwillig was practically carrying Tred but neither dwarf complained The sound of worgs echoed all around them but their diversion had worked it seemed throwing the pursuit off the scent and making more than a few of the creatures think twice about continuing their pursuit Sometime later from a high vantage point the dwarves spotted a few small campfires in the distance Not one large encampment it seemed but several smaller groups Their mistake Tred remarked and Nikwillig thoroughly agreed With a new goal in sight the dwarves moved along at an even swifter pace When his leg locked up on him Tred merely hopped and if he fell to the stone which he often did the tough dwarf merely pulled himself up spat in his hand to clean off the new scrape and scrambled forward Down along one clear patch of ground they encountered another wolf but even as it bared its teeth and hunched its back in a threatening posture Tred launched his axe into its flank laying it low Nikwillig was quick to the spot finishing the beast before its yelps could alert the orc camp which wasnt faraway Soon after and with the eastern sky brightening in the first signs of dawn the pair crept up a small dirt banking and peered through the gap between a tree trunk and a boulder A small campfire burned beyond with a trio of orcs sitting around it and several more sleeping nearby A single injured worg sat beside the trio snarling growling licking its wounds and turning a hateful eye upon one of the orcs whenever it offered a berating curse at the inability of the worg and its companions to catch the fleeing dwarves Nikwillig put a finger to his pursed lips and motioned for Tred to stay put He slipped off to the side taking full advantage of the obvious fact that the confident orcs werent expecting any unannounced visitors Tred watched his progress with a nod and a grin as Nikwillig bellycrawled to the edge of the encampment putting his knife to fast work on one then a second sleeping orc The observant dwarf saw the worgs head come up fast though and so he knew the game was up With all the strength he could muster Tred pulled himself up between the boulder and the tree Well ye wanted me and so ye found me he roared The trio of orcs and the worg leaped up and gave a shout Their third sleeping companion similarly started but Nikwillig was already beside it laying it low before it could even begin to respond The closest orc brandished a huge axe and charged headlong at Tred coming in with a fancy spinning maneuver that showed the creature was no novice with the weapon But neither was he a profound thinker obviously for when Tred lifted his hand and hurled the stone he had picked up when he had announced himself the orc was caught completely by surprise and taken right in the face The stunned orc stumbled forward and Treds swinging battleaxe promptly swatted it aside The other two orcs glanced around only then realizing the devious work of Nikwillig and the presence of the second dwarf Two against two Nikwillig said to them in the grunting Orcish tongue We got wolfie one started to respond but the battered worg apparently didnt agree for it darted out of the camp and ran yelping along the dark trails One of the orcs tried to take the same course leaping off to the side Tred didnt hesitate launching his axe at the fleeing creature The spinning weapon didnt miss but neither did it fully connect tripping up the orc and slowing it as the handle tangled between its legs but not hurting it much at all The second orc seeing the obviously wounded dwarf standing there apparently unarmed howled and lifted its jagged sword It charged in hard Nikwillig knew he couldnt get to Tred in time so he went for the fallen orc first Leaping upon the creature even as it started to rise he bore it to the ground beneath his heavy boots Nikwillig stomped and stabbed with his sword trading a stinging hit from the orcs spear as it came around in exchange for a clear opening at the creatures chest Nikwilligs shoulder stung from the stab to be sure but his sword opened the orc from breast to belly He heard Tred crying out for his brother then with grunts between each shout Nikwillig turned expecting to see his friend in dire straits He let his weapon slide low for Tred had the situation and the orc well in hand He gripped the orc by the wrists holding the creatures arms up high and out wide and after every cry for his lost brother Tred snapped his head forward and yanked the orcs arms out wider the pair connecting forehead to face with each jolt The first few belts sounded loud and solid bone on bone but each succeeding smash made a crunchier sound as if Tred was driving his forehead into a pile of dry twigs I think ye can put it down now Nikwillig remarked dryly after a few more thumps the orc having long gone limp Tred grabbed the battered dying creature by the collar with one hand and slapped his other hand hard into the orcs groin A heave and a twist had the orc high over the powerful dwarfs head With another call for his lost brother Tred launched the orc down the bank behind him to crash hard against a rock below Lots of supplies Nikwillig remarked hopping about the camp Damn orc sticked me Tred replied Only then did his companion notice a new wound on the sturdy dwarf a bright line of blood running from the side of Treds chest Nikwillig started for his companion but Tred waved him back Ye gather the supplies and well get going he explained Ill dress it meself He did just that and the pair were on their way soon after Tred grunting in pain with every step but otherwise offering not the slightest complaint He had lost a bucket of blood or more and every time his foot slipped on a loose rock the resulting lurch opened his newest wound anew moistening his side with fresh blood Still Tred didnt complain nor did he slow Nikwilligs brisk pace Their turn and attack had daunted the pursuit it seemed for few howls came rolling out to them on the night winds and none of those were very close When Tred and Nikwillig crested a high ridge and looked far down upon a distant villagejust a cluster of houses really they looked to each other with concern We go in there and we might bring a horde o orcs and wolfies on em Tred reasoned And if we dont go in yere gonna slow and slow some more Nikwillig replied Well not be making Mithral Hall anytime soon if we can even find our way to the place Ye think theyre knowin how to fight Tred asked looking back to the village Theyre living in the wild mountains aint they Simple enough and true enough and so Tred just gave a shrug and followed Nikwillig along the descending trail A wall of piled stones as tall as a man surrounded the cluster of houses but it wasnt until the pair got very close that they noted any sentries Even the two humansa man and a womenwho finally pecked over the wall to call out to them didnt seem as if they were formal sentries It was as if they simply happened to be walking by and noticed the dwarves What are you two about came the womans call Wed be about to fall Id be guessin Nikwillig answered He propped Tred up a bit to accentuate his point Ye got a warm bed and a bit o hot stew for me injured kinfolk here As if all of his energy had been given in the march and his stubborn mind finally allowed his body the chance to rest Tred fell limp and collapsed to the ground Nikwillig guided him down as softly as possible There was no gate on that side of the village but the woman and man came right out scrambling over the wall and rushing to the dwarves They particularly the woman went to work inspecting the injured dwarf but they also both looked past the two dwarves as if they expected an army of enemies to be chasing the battered duo in You from Mithral Hall the man asked Felbarr Nikwillig answered We was headin for Shallows when we got hit Shallows the woman echoed Long way Long chase What hit you Ores asked the man Orcs an giants Giants Havent seen any hill giants about in a long time Not hill giants Blueskinned dogs Lookin pretty and hittin ugly Frost giants Both the man and woman looked up at him in concern their eyes going wide The folk of this region were not unfamiliar with trouble concerning frost giants The old Grayhand Jarl Orel hadnt always kept his mighty people deep within the mountains over the decades though thankfully the frost giant forays hadnt been numerous Still any fight in any part of the area that included frost giants perhaps the most formidable enemy in all the region next to the very occasional dragon became news dire news the stuff of fireside tales and nightmares Lets get him inside the woman offered Hes needing a bed and a hot meal I cant believe hes even alive Bah Treds too ugly to die Nikwillig remarked Tred opened a weary eye and slowly lifted his hand toward his friends face as if to pat him thankfully But as he got close he pressed his index finger under his thumb and flicked Nikwillig under the nose Nikwillig fell back grabbing his nose and Tred settled back down closing his eyes a slight smile spreading on his crusty pale face The folk of the small village Clicking Heels multiplied their guarding duties many times over with a third of the two hundred sturdy folk working at a time as sentries and scouts in eight hour shifts After two days recuperating Nikwillig joined in those duties bolstering the line and even helping to direct the construction of some additional fortification Tred though was in no position to take part in anything The dwarf slept through the night and through the day Even after a couple of days he woke only long enough to devour a huge meal the good folk of Clicking Heels were kind enough to supply There was one cleric in the town as well but he wasnt very skilled at the magical pan of his vocation and his healing skills though he piled them on Tred did little more good than the rest By the fifth day Tred was up and about and starting to look and sound like his surly old self once more By the end of a tenday and still with no pursuitgiant orc or worgin sight Tred was anxious to get moving Were off to Mithral Hall Nikwillig announced one morning and the folk of Clicking Heels humans all seemed genuinely sorry to see the dwarves off Well get King Gandalug to send some warriors up to check in on ye King Bruenor you mean one of the villagers replied If hes returned to his folk from far off Icewind Dale That right So weve heard Nikwillig nodded offering a sigh for the loss of Gandalug before returning to his typically determined expression King Bruenor then as fair a dwarf as eer theres been Im not sure he II comply and send his soldiers nor am convinced that we need them the man went on Well well tell him whats about and let him make up his own mind then Tred interjected Thats why hes the king after all That same morning Tred and Nikwillig walked out of Clicking Heels their steps strong once more their packs full of suppliesgood and tasty food and drink not the slop they had stolen from the orcs The folk had given them detailed directions to Mithral Hall as well and so the dwarves were hopeful that they would find the end of this part of their journey soon enough They intended to go to Mithral Hall warn King Bruenor or whomever it was leading their bearded kin then get an escort from there through the connecting tunnels of the upper Underdark back to their homes in Citadel Felbarr Even that wouldnt be the end of the road for Tred at least for the tough dwarf had every intention of raising a band of warriors to head back out and avenge his brother and the others First things first though and that meant finding their way to Mithral Hall Despite the directions the dwarves found that no easy task in the winding and confusing mountain trails A wrong turn along the narrow channels running through the stone often meant a long and difficult backtrack Its the wrong damn stream Tred grumbled one morning the pair moving along steadily but going south and east whereas Mithral Hall was southwest of Clicking Heels Itll wind back Nikwillig assured him Bah Tred snorted shaking a fist at his companion They were lost and he knew it and so did Nikwillig whether hed admit it or not They didnt turn back though The road along the river had led them down a pair of very difficult descents that promised to be even more difficult climbs To turn around after having gone so far seemed foolish They continued on and when the stream took another unexpected dive over a waterfall Tred grunted grumbled and climbed down the rocks to the side Might be that its time to think about going th other way Nikwillig offered Bah was all that stubborn Tred would reply and that grunt was exaggerated for Tred hit an especially slick stone as he had waved his hand in a dismissive manner at Nikwillig He got down to the bottom faster at least They went on in silence after that and were looking about for a place to set camp when they crested one outcropping of huge cracked boulders to see the land fall away wide and low before them a huge valley running east and west Big pass Nikwillig remarked One caravans might be using to get to Mithral Hall Tred reasoned West it is Nikwillig nodded standing beside his companion glad as was Tred to see that the going might be much easier the next day Of course neither knew that they were standing on the northern rim of Fell Pass the site of a great battle of old where the very real and very dangerous ghosts of the vanquished lingered in great numbers CONFLICTING LOYALTIES The dwarf councilor Agrathan Hardhammer shifted uneasily in his seat as the volume around him increased along with the agitation of the others all human in the room Perhaps you should have granted him an audience said Shoudra Stargleam the sceptrana of the city Shoudras bright blue eyes flashed as she spoke and she shook her head as she always seemed to be doing letting her long dark hair fly wide to either side Her hair was often the subject of gossip among the women of the city for though Shoudra was in her thirties and had lived for all her life in the harsh windblown climate of Mirabar it held the luster and shine that one might expect on the head of a girl half Shoudras age In all respects the sceptrana was a beautiful creature tall and lithe yet with deceptively delicate features Deceptive because though she was ultimately feminine Shoudra Stargleam was possessed of a solidity a formidability that rivaled the strongest of Mirabars men The fat man sitting on the cushioned throne the Marchion of Mirabar smirked at her and waved his hands in disgust I had and have more important matters to attend to than to see to the needs of an unannounced visitor the marchion said staring hard at Agrathan as he spoke even if that visitor is the King of Mithral Hall Besides is it not your duty and not mine own to negotiate trade agreements King Bruenor did not come here for any such purpose by any reports Shoudra protested drawing another wave of Marchion Elastul s thick hands Elastul shook his head and looked about at his Hammers his principal attendants scarred old warriors all Might that she shouldve met with Bruenor anyway Djaffar the leader of the group remarked He nudged the marchions shoulder Shoudras got a trick or two that could soften even a dwarf The other three soldieradvisors and Marchion Elastul burst out in snickers at that Shoudra Stargleam narrowed her blue eyes and assumed a defiant pose crossing her arms over her chest To the side Agrathan shifted again He knew Shoudra could handle herself and that she like all the folk of Mirabar who had any access to Elastul was used to the liberties of protocol often taken by the vulgar Hammers and by the marchion himself His was an inherited position unlike the elected councilors and sceptrana He asked to see you Marchion not me and not the council Shoudra reminded curtly ending the snickers And what am I to do with the likes of Bruenor Battlehammer Elastul replied Dine with him Cater to him and quietly explain to him that he will soon be irrelevant Shoudra looked over at Agrathan plaintively and the dwarf cleared his throat drawing the marchions attention Ye wouldnt be doing well to underestimate Bruenor Agrathan advised His boysre good at what they do Irrelevant Elastul said again settling back comfortably That curiosity piece Gandalug is dead may the stones powder his bones and Bruenor is inheriting a kingdom on the decline Again Shoudra looked over at Agrathan this time wearing a doubting smirk for she and the dwarf knew what was coming More than two dozen metallurgists and alchemists Elastul boasted Im paying them well and theyll be showing results soon enough Agrathan lowered his eyes so that Elastul wouldnt see his doubting expression as the marchion went on to describe the most recent promises of those folks he had hired in an effort to strengthen the metal produced by Mirabars mines The metallurgists had been promising from the day they arrived several years before combinations of strength and flexibility beyond anything anyone in all the world could produce Grand and as far as Agrathan believed empty claims all Agrathan hadnt worked the mines in over a century since he had turned to the practice of preaching the word of Dumathoinbut as a priest of that dwarf god a deity who was known as the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain Agrathan firmly believed that the claims of the hired alchemists and metallurgists were not among those secrets To Agrathan if some magical way to enhance any metal wasnt among the secrets of Dumathoin then it simply didnt exist The hired group was very good at what it did What it did as far as Agrathan was concerned was keep the marchion curious and intrigued enough to keep the gold flowing and that was all that was flowing Mirabar boasted less than half the dwarves of Mithral Hall just over two thousand and several hundred of those were busy serving in the Axe keeping the mines clear of monsters The thousand who worked the mines could barely meet the quotas set out by the Council of Sparkling Stones each year and that from existing veins Little exploration was being done at the deeper levels where the dangers were greater but so too were the true promises of better quality in the form of better ore The simple fact was that Mirabar couldnt afford to cut production long enough to seek out those better veins so the marchion had fallen into the scam of these supposed specialistswith not a dwarf among them who claimed to understand metals so well Besides to Agrathans thinking if there were such processes as the marchion believed why hadnt they been put in practice centuries before Why hadnt these metallurgists and alchemists reduced the dwarves of Mithral Hall the dwarves of all the world to positions of providing base material alone They promised weapons armor and other metal goods strong enough to outshine anything Bruenors folk might produce and yet if they knew of such secrets if there were such secrets then why werent there weapons of legend that had been produced through such processes Even if your specialists deliver their promises we will still be far from making King Bruenor and Mithral Hall irrelevant Shoudra Stargleam replied and Agrathan was glad that she was taking the lead They are outproducing us in volume more than threetotwo The marchion waved his hands at her There was nothing for me to say to Bruenor Battlehammer anyway Why did he come here Who invited him Who asked He ended with a derisive snort Perhaps we should not have allowed him entrance Shoudra remarked Agrathan looked up at Elastul guessing correctly the dangerous glare the marchion would be offering to Shoudra at that moment When word that King Bruenor was at Mirabars gate had been passed along it had been Elastuls decision to let Bruenor and the others in None on the council or the secptrana had even been informed until the Clan Battlehammer dwarves had already set up their carts on Mirabars streets Yes perhaps my faith in the loyalty of my citizens was misplaced the marchion countered harsh words aimed more at Agrathan the dwarf knew than at Shoudra I expected King Bruenor to find greater embarrassment than rejection by the ruler of the city I expected the folk of Mirabar to know enough to not even bother with our guests Agrathan glanced over to see that the marchion was indeed staring directly at him as he spoke No humans after all had gone to do business with Clan Battlehammer only dwarves and Agrathan was the highestranking dwarf in the city the unofficial leader and voice of Mirabars two thousand Have you spoken with Master Hammerstriker What would ye have me say Agrathan asked While he was the accepted voice for the dwarves among the human leaders that wasnt always the case among the Mirabarran dwarves themselves I would have you remind Master Hammerstriker where his loyalties lie the marchion replied Or where they should lie Agrathan worked hard to keep his expression placid to hide the sudden storm welling inside of him The loyalty of Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker could not be questioned The crusty old warrior had served the marchion and the marchion before him and before him and before him and before him and before him for longer than any human in the city could remember longer than the long dead parents of the dead parents of any human in the city could have remembered Torgar had been among the leading soldiers charging along the tunnels of the upper Underdark against monsters more foul than anything any of the marchions Hammersthose elite advisors selected supposedly because of their glorious veteran warrior statushad ever known When the orc hordes attacked Mirabar a hundred and seventeen years past Torgar and a very few other dwarves had held the eastern wall strong against the assault fending off the hordes while the bulk of Mirabars warriors had been engaged on the western wall against what had proven to be no more than a feint by the enemy In scars wounds and cunning victories Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker had earned his position as a leader among the Axe But even to Agrathan the marchions words rang with a bit of truth It wasnt a question of loyalty as far as Agrathan was concerned but rather one of judgment Torgar and his fellows had not understood the implications of trading with their rivals from Mithral Hall or from subsequently socializing with them With that Agrathan and Shoudra left the agitated marchion walking side by side along the outer corridors of the palace and out into the pale sunlight of the late afternoon A chill breeze was blowing a reminder to the pair that in Mirabar winter was never far away You will approach Torgar with a bit more gentleness than Marchion Elastul showed Shoudra asked the dwarf her smile one of genuine amusement As sceptrana Shoudra was involved in signing trade agreements With the rise of Mithral Hall she too had suffered or at least her work had Shoudra Stargleam had taken it more in stride than many others in the city though including many of the dwarves To her the way to beat Mithral Hall was to increase production and find better ore for better product To her the rise of a trading rival should be the catalyst to make Mirabar stronger Ill tell Torgar and his boys what I can but ye know that one and know that not many can be telling Torgar anything He is loyal to Mirabar Shoudra stated and though Agrathan nodded the expression on his face showed that he wasnt so certain of that anymore Shoudra Stargleam caught that look and stopped and put her hand on Agrathans shoulder to stop him as well Is he loyal to city or to race she asked Does he consider the marchion his true leader or King Bruenor of Mithral Hall Torgars fought well for every marchion since before yer parents were born girl Agrathan reminded her Shoudra nodded but like Torgar a moment earlier she didnt seem overly convinced They should not have gone to trade and drink with the visiting dwarves Shoudra remarked She bustled her cloak in front of her and started on her way Mighty temptations there Good trade good drink and better stories Are ye thinking that my folk arent wanting to hear the Battle of Keepers Dale Are ye thinking that your own world would be a better place if the damn drow invaders had won at Mithral Hall Well perhaps if the dark elves had inflicted a bit more damage before they had been chased off Shoudra replied Agrathan snapped a scowl over her but it was quickly defeated for the woman was grinning mischievously even as she spoke the words Bah Agrathan snorted So by your reasoning Mirabar owes a debt to Mithral Hall for their victory against the dark elves Shoudra asked Agrathan paused for a moment and thought long and hard on that one In the end he shrugged not willing to make a commitment Shoudra grinned again and nodded for it was obvious that the dwarfs heart was giving one answer and his pragmatic head the part that owed loyalty to Marchion Elastul and Mirabar was giving another H wasnt a laughing matter though In fact the notion that Agrathan a major voice on the Council of Sparkling Stones was apparently holding mixed feelings concerning Mithral Hall incited more than a little trepidation in the sceptrana Agrathan had been one of the strongest voices of opposition to Mithral Hall often relating the words of his more vocal dwarf constituents who wanted covert action to be taken against Clan Battlehammer Agrathan had once outlined a plan for infiltrating the neighboring kingdom and slipping coolerburning charcoal into their stores weakening their smelting and shaping work Many times during council meetings Agrathan Hardhammer had himself exploded in tirades against the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer but having seen them facetoface Shoudra was seeing the true depth of his and his peoples resolve Tell me Agrathan was that famous drow elf accompanying King Bruenors caravan Drizzt DoUrden Yes he was there but they didnt let him into the city Shoudra looked at him curiously Drizzt had made quite a reputation for himself in the North even before his actions against his own people when they had attacked Mithral Hall By all accounts he was a hero The Axe werent about to let a cursed dark elf walk the streets whatever his name Agrathan said firmly but he was there Torgar and some others saw him and that human girl that Bruenor is calling his own along with that human boy that Bruenor is calling his own off to the side watching it all Was he as handsome as they say Shoudra asked Agrathan turned an even bigger scowl over her twisted into an expression of skepticism Hes a drow ye damned fool Shoudra Stargleam merely laughed and Agrathan shook his hairy head They stopped their walk then for they had come to Undercity Square an open area between three buildings one of them a large sectioned building where Shoudra kept her apartment In the center of the triangular area was a descending stairway which led to the most heavily guarded room in all of Mirabar the main entrance to the Undercitythe real city as far as Agrathan and his kin were concerned where the real work went on Shoudra bid the dwarf farewell and entered her house Agrathan stood at the top of the stairway for a long long while more uncomfortable than he had ever been before entering the domain of Mirabars two thousand dwarves It was his solemn duty to go and deliver the marchions message to Torgar and the others but Agrathan knew his kin well enough to understand that the words would cause more than a little anger and division among the dwarves Their emotions ran the gamut concerning Mithral Hall Many of the Mirabarran dwarves had even called for confiscation of any Mithral Hall caravan moving west of Clan Battlehammers domain knowing full well that such an action might mean open warfare between the two cities Others quietly remarked that their ancestors had lived in Mithral Hall with King Bruenors predecessors and that it had been a good life as good a life as any dwarf could ever want Agrathan snorteda dwarven sigh he called itand thumped his way down the stairs brushing past the many human guards in the upper chamber as he made his way to the lift He waved away the attendant and worked the heavy ropes himself lowering himself down hundreds of feet to a second wellguarded room with all exits blocked by external portcullises and ironbound doors The guards there were all dwarves some of the toughest of all the Axe Ye go and put the word to all our kin in all the holes Agrathan instructed them and to them working the walls up top Were meeting after sunset in the Hall of All Fires and I want every one of my boys there Everyone The guards opened one of the exits for Agrathan and he exited head down and murmuring to himself trying to discern the best way to handle this most delicate of situations Though he was more tactful than most as was evidenced by his rank in a city that was dominated by humans Agrathan was still a dwarf and subtlety had never been his strong point The scene was never controlled and quiet in the Hall of All Fires when a significant number of Mirabars dwarves were assembled but that night with nearly all of the citys two thousand in attendance and with the subject so controversial the place was in absolute chaos So now yere to tell me whose story I can hear and whose I cant Torgar Hammerstriker roared back at Agrathan It was a good bit o ale and a finer bit o tales Many of the dwarves who had accompanied Torgar to the Icewind Dale bazaar and later to the Clan Battlehammer reception shouted their agreement One or two held up beautiful pieces of scrimshaw they had purchased from the traders wonderful pieces gotten at better prices I can resell this in Nesme for ten times what I paid one industrious redbearded fellow declared He jumped high onto a dark furnace holding up his small statuea scrimshaw depiction of a shapely barbarian womanfor all to see Ye tellin me I cant be making good deals priest Agrathan slumped back a bit not surprised by the reaction I have come to deliver the words of Marchion Elastul a reminder and yes a stern oneto us all that the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer are not friends to Mirabar They take our trade Is there a one of us here who can rightly say that hes livin better since they opened Mithral Hall again another dwarf cut the priest off Even wit yer pretty statue fat Bullwhip yere not to have a good year in the matter o yer purse now are ye Many dwarves seconded that cheering the agitated speaker on We had better lives and bigger coins afore the damn Battlehammers came back in And who invited them Bah Yere talking the part of a fool Torgar lashed out Says the dwarf who looked to other councilors for a loan the fiery one shot back Ye needin coin now Torgar Will King Bruenors stories fill yer belly Torgar climbed up to the raised area at the north end of the hall to stand beside Agrathan He paused for a long while looking to and fro commanding everyones attention What Im hearing here is jealous talk plain and simple he said very calmly Yere talking about Clan Battlehammer as if theyve declared war upon us when all theyve done is open up mines thatve been there and been theirs since afore Mirabar was Mirabar Theyve a right to their homeland and a right to make it work Were sittin here making plans to bring em down when its seemin to me that we should be making plans to bring ourselfs up They been stealin our business someone yelled from the crowd Ye forgetting that part They been beatin us Torgar pointedly and immediately corrected They got better mines an better metal and they built themselves a strong reputation one dead orc duergar and stinkin drow elf at a time Ye cant be blamin King Bruenor and his boys for working hard and fighting harder The shouts erupted from every corner many in agreement and many in dissent A couple of fistfights broke out in various corners of the hall Up on the raised platform Torgar and Agrathan stared hard at each other and though neither had fully embraced the others viewpoint on this matter only a few days before their respective visions were crystallizing There came a shout from somewhere in the crowd Hey priestie ye taking the side o the humans over that o yer kinfolk dwarfs Both Torgar and Agrathan turned at once and many others did as well All the great meeting chamber went silent dwarves stopping their fighting in midswing for there it was spelled out simply and to the point For Torgar it was a moment of confusion and selfexamination Was it actually coming down to this a choice between his dwarven kin of Mithral Hall and the joint community of Mirabar For Agrathan leading member of the Council of Sparkling Stones the choice was less fuzzy for indeed if that was the way that some of his kin chose to view things then so be it Agrathans loyalties lay to Mirabar and to Mirabar alone but when he looked at his counterpart he saw that the marchions remarks which Agrathan had considered insulting toward Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker were not without merit Agrathans faith in his community was a bit shaken a moment later when the great gates of the Hall of All Fires swung wide and a large contingent of the Axe of Mirabar swept in wading into the confused throng in a wedge formation then forcefully widening their stance so that a huge triangular area of the room was quickly secured In marched the marchion and several of the more stern councilors along with the sceptrana This is not the behavior the human folk of Mirabar expects from their dwarf comrades Elastul scolded He should have left it at that a quiet and calm reminder that the city had enough enemies without to worry about such squabbles within Accept that Torgar Hammerstriker and those who accompanied him to the carts of Clan Battlehammer and to the liars er the bards of the same clan erred and badly in their judgment Elastul bluntly warned Beware Master Hammerstriker lest you lose your position in the Axe For the rest of you lured by ale and this creature this false legend who is Bruenor Battlehammer remind yourselves where your loyalties lie and remind yourselves as well that Clan Battlehammer threatens our city Elastul swiveled his head slowly taking in all the gathering trying to wilt them under his stern gaze But these were dwarves after all and few wilted and few of those who agreed with the marchion wagged their heads Many of those who disagreed stood a bit straighter and a bit taller and in looking at his counterpart on the stage Agrathan seriously wondered if Torgar was going to peel off his Axe insignia then and there and throw it at Elastuls feet Disperse I command you Marchion Elastul roared Back to your work and back to your lives The dwarves did disperse then and the marchion and his entourage including the human soldiers departed with the sole exception of Shoudra Stargleam who stayed to speak with Agrathan Well aint them the words of a true king Torgar muttered as he walked past Agrathan and he spat at the priests feet The marchion was illadvised to be coming here like that now Agrathan remarked to Shoudra when they were alone Many of your peers on the council pressed him to action Shoudra explained They feared that the visit of King Bruenor might be having an adverse affect on our dwarf citizens It was Agrathan said glumly and it is Even more now Agrathan meant every word He watched the remaining dwarves departing the hall or going back to stoke the furnaces that lined it He noted their expressions their deepset scowls and angry eyes Torgars misjudgment had brought a rift in the clan had put a wedge into the solid community Agrathan couldnt help but think that the marchion had just taken a sledge and smashed that wedge hard WHERE GHOSTS ROAM The troupe crossed the bridge to the south of Mirabar then followed the River Mirar to the east of the city for a tenday of easy marching South of them loomed the tall trees of Lurkwood a forest known to harbor many orc tribes and other unpleasant neighbors To the north stood the towering mountains of the Spine of the World their tops holding defiantly white against the coming summer season The grass grew tall around them and dandelions dotted the rolling fields of the Valley of Khedrun but the evervigilant dwarves were not lulled by the peaceful season and scenery This far to the north anywhere outside of a city had to be considered untamed land so they doubled their guard every night circled their wagons and kept Drizzt Cattibrie and Wulfgar working the flanks Guenhwyvar joined the trio in their scouting whenever Drizzt was able to summon her At the eastern end of the valley with nearly a hundred miles between them and Mirabar the River Mirar bent to the north flowing from the foothills of the Spine of the World The Lurkwood meanwhile also bent to the north following the line of the river as if shadowing the water several miles to the south Grounds gonna get tougher Bruenor warned them all as they set camp that night Well be back in the foothills tomorrow by midday and moving tight under the shadows o the forest He looked around at his clan to see every head nodding stoically Next daysll be tougher Bruenor told them and not a one batted an eye They broke their gathering and went back to their posts The roads not so bad by my measuring Delly Curtie said to Wulfgar when he joined her and Colson their young daughter at the small leanto Delly had set beside a wagon No meaner than Luskans streets Weve been fortunate so far Wulfgar replied holding his arms out to take Colson whom Delly gladly gave over Wulfgar looked down at the tiny girl the daughter of Meralda Feringal the Lady of Auckney a small town nestled in the Spine of the World not far to the west of the pass that had brought the troupe out of Icewind Dale Wulfgar had rescued Colson from the trials of Lord Feringal and his tyrannical sister retribution against the bastard child since Colson was not Feringals daughter The Lord of Auckney had thought Wulfgar the father for Meralda had concocted a lie to protect the mans honor claiming that she had been raped on the road But Wulfgar was not the father had never known Meralda in that manner Looking at Colson though at the tiny creature who had become so precious to him he wished that he was He looked up from Colson to see Delly staring at him lovingly and he knew that he was a lucky man indeed Ye going out with Drizzt and Cattibrie tonight Delly asked Wulfgar shook his head Were too close to the Lurkwood Drizzt and Cattibrie can keep the watch well enough without me Yere staying close because yere afraid for me and Colson Delly reasoned and Wulfgar didnt disagree The woman reached to take the baby back but Wulfgar rolled his shoulder to block her hands grinning at her all the time Ye cannot be forsaking yer duties for me own sake Delly complained and Wulfgar laughed at her This he said presenting the baby then pulling her back in close when Delly reached for her is my duty first and foremost Drizzt and Cattibrie know it too We are close to the Lurkwood now and that means close to orcs You might be thinking that Luskans streets are meaner than the wilds because youve not yet truly seen the wilds If the orcs come upon us in numbers the blood will flow Ore blood mostly but with dwarf blood mixed in Youve never witnessed a battle my love and I hope it stays like that but out here He let it go at that shaking his head And if the orcs come for us yell be there keeping them off me and Colson Delly reasoned Wulfgar determined looked at her then down at Colson who was sleeping angelically in his arms His smile widened No orc no giant no dragon will harm you he promised the babe lifting his eyes to include Delly as well Delly started to respond and Wulfgar was sure she meant to offer one of her typically sarcastic remarks but she didnt She stopped short and just stood there staring at him even offering a little nod to show that she did not doubt him As Bruenor had warned the traveling got much more difficult the next day with grassy meadows giving way to boulderstrewn trails climbing into the foothills The ground was flatter to the south but veering there would have put the dwarves into the thick underbrush and dangerous shadows of the Lurkwood home to many unfriendly beasts With so many sturdy dwarves in the caravan Bruenor decided to keep them out in the open o let any enemies understand the power of the force The dwarves did not complain and when they came upon a gully or a particularly broken stretch over which the wagons could not roll a host of dwarves moved up beside each cart lifting it in their strong hands and carrying it across That was their way an attitude of logical stoicism and pragmatism that cut long tunnels through hard rock one inch at a time Watching them at their march Drizzt understood well the kind of determination and longrange thinking that had produced such beautiful and marvelous places as Mithral Hall It was the same patience that had allowed one such as Bruenor to create Aegisfang to deliberately engrave perfect representations of the trio of dwarf gods on the hammers head where one errant scratch would have ruined the whole process Soon after the second day out of Khedrun Pass with the trees of the Lurkwood so near that the group could hear birds singing in the boughs a cry from the front confirmed Bruenors other fear Ores outta the woods Form yer battle groups Bruenor called Group One Left make yer wedge Dagnabbit shouted One Right square up To the left farthest from the woods Drizzt and Cattibrie watched the precision of the veteran dwarf warriors and saw the small band of orcs rushing out of the forest making for the lead wagons The orcs hadnt scouted their intended target properly it seemed for once they cleared the brush and saw the scope of the force allayed before them they skidded to a stop and fell all over each other in fast retreat How different were their movements from those of the calm skilled dwarves well almost all of the dwarves Ignoring the calls of Bruenor and Dagnabbit Thibbledorf Pwent and his Gutbusters assembled into their own formation unique to their tactics They called it a charge but to Drizzt and Cattibrie it more resembled an avalanche Pwent and his boys whooped hollered and scrambled headlong into the darkness of the forest shadows in pursuit of the orcs leaping through the first line of brush with gleeful abandon The orcs may have set a trap Cattibrie warned showing us but a small part o their force to drag us into their webs Cries resounded within the boughs just south of the caravan and flora and fauna and orc body parts began to fly wildly all about the area the Gutbusters had entered Stupid orcs then Drizzt replied He started down from the higher ground Cattibrie in tow to join Bruenor When they reached the king they found him standing on his wagon bench hands on his hips and with groups of properly arrayed dwarves in tight formations al I around him One wedge of warriors passed skillfully by the defensive squares two others had assembled Aint ye going to join the fun Bruenor asked Drizzt looked back at the forest at the continuing tumult a volcano come to life and shook his head Too dangerous the drow explained Damn Pwent makes it hard to see the point o discipline Bruenor grumbled to his friends He winced and so did Drizzt and CattiBrie and Regis who was standing near to Bruenor when an orc came flying out of the underbrush to land face down on the clearer ground in front of the dwarves Before any of Bruenors boys could react they heard a wild roar from back within the boughs up high and stared in blank amazement as Thibbledorf Pwent high up in a tree ran out to the end of one branch and leaped out long and far The orc was just beginning to rise when Pwent landed on its back blasting it back down to the ground Likely it was already dead but the wild battlerager with broken branches and leaves stuck all about his ridged armor went into his devastating body shake turning the orc into a bloody mess Pwent hopped up then hopped all around Ye can get em moving again me king he yelled back to Bruenor Well be done here soon enough And the Lurkwood will never be the same Drizzt mumbled If I was a squirrel anywhere around here Id be thinking of making meself a new home Cattibrie concurred Id pay a big bird to fly me far away Regis added Should we hold the positions Dagnabbit called to Bruenor Nah get the wagons moving the dwarf king replied with a wave of his hand We stay here and well all get splattered Pwent and his boys some hurt but hardly caring rejoined their fellows a short while later singing songs of victory and battle Nothing serious emanated from this group Their songs sounded more like the joyful rhymes of children at play Watching Pwent makes me wonder if I wasted my youth with all that training Drizzt said to Cattibrie later on the pair patrolling with Guenhwyvar along the northern foothills again Yeah ye couldve just whiled away the hours banging yer head against a stone wall like Pwent and his boys did Without a helmet Aye the woman confirmed keeping a straight face Though Im thinking that Bruenor made him armor the poor wall Protecting the structural integrity of the realm Ah said Drizzt nodding then just shaking his head helplessly No more orc bands made any appearances against the caravan throughout the rest of that day nor over the next few The going was difficult and slow but still not a dwarf complained even when they had to spend the better part of a rainy day moving the remnants of an old rockslide from the trail As the days wore on though more and more rumbles began to filter through the line of wagons for it became obvious to them all that Bruenor wasnt planning a turn to the south anytime soon Ores Cattibrie remarked examining the partial footprint in the dirt of a high trail The woman looked up and all around as if gauging the wind and the air Few days maybe At least a few replied Drizzt who was a short distance away leaning on a boulder with his arms crossed over his chest scrutinizing the womans work as if he knew something that she did not What the woman asked catching the nonverbal cue Perhaps I have a wider picture of it Drizzt answered Cattibrie narrowed her eyes as she stared hard at the drow matching his mischievous grin with a thinlipped one of her own She started to say something less than complimentary but then caught on that perhaps the drow was speaking literally She stood up and stepped back taking in the area of the footprint from a wider viewpoint Only then did she realize that the orc print was beside the mark of a much larger boot Much larger Ore was here first she stated without hesitation How do you know that Drizzt wasnt playing the part of instructor here but rather he seemed genuinely curious as to how the woman had come to that Giant might be chasin the orc but Im doubting that the orcs chasing the giant How do you know they werent traveling together Cattibrie looked back to the tracks Not a hill giant she explained for it was well known that hill giants often allied with orcs Too big Mountain giant perhaps said Drizzt Larger version of the same creature Cattibrie shook her head doubtfully Most mountain giants typically didnt even wear boots covering their feet with skin wraps if at all The sharp definitions of the giant heel print made her believe that this particular boot was well made Even more telling the foot was narrow relatively speaking whereas mountain giants were known to have huge wide feet Stone giants might be wearin boots the woman reasoned and frost giants always do So you think the giant was chasing the orc The woman looked over at Drizzt again and shrugged With it put so plainly Drizzt apparently wasnt questioning hershe realized just how shaky that theory truly was Could be she said or they might ye just passed this way independent of each other Or they might be workin together A frost giant and an orc came the skeptical question A woman and a drow came the snide response and Drizzt laughed The pair moved on without much concern The tracks were not fresh and even if it was an orc or a group of orcs and a giant or two besides theyd think twice before attacking an army of five hundred dwarves It was slow and it was hot and it was dry but no more monsters showed themselves to the force as the dwarves stubbornly made their way to the east They climbed up one dusty trail the sun hot on their backs but when they crested the ridge and started down the backside all the world seemed to change A vast rocky vale loomed before them with towering mountains both north and south Shadows dotted the valley and even in those places where there seemed no obstacle to block the sunlight the ground appeared dull dour and somehow mysterious Wisps of fog flitted about the valley though there was no obvious water source and little dewcatching grass could be seen Bruenor Regis Dagnabbit and Wulfgar and his family led the way down the backside of the ridge to find Drizzt and Cattibrie waiting for their wagon Yere not likin what yere seein Bruenor asked Drizzt noticing a disconcerted expression on the face of the normally cool drow Drizzt shook his head as if he couldnt put it into words A strange feeling he explained or tried to He looked back toward the gloomy vale and shook his head again Im feelin it too Cattibrie chimed in Like were bein looked at Ye probably are Bruenor said He cracked the whip and sent his team which also seemed more than a little skittish moving down the trail The dwarf gave a laugh but those around him didnt seem so comfortable particularly Wulfgar who kept looking back at Delly and Colson Your wagon should not be in the front Drizzt reminded Bruenor As I been telling him Dagnabbit agreed Bruenor only snorted and drove the team on calling back to the next wagons in line and to the soldiers flanking them Bah theyre all hesitating Bruenor complained Can ye not feel it Dagnabbit asked Feel it Im swimmin in it shortbeard Well put up right down there he conceded pointing to a flat open area just below about a third of the way down the side of the ridge then ye get em all about and Ill give them the tale The tale Cattibrie asked the same question that all the others were about to voice The tale o the pass Bruenor explained The Fell Pass It was a name that meant little to Bruenors Icewind Dale nondwarf companions but Dagnabbit blanched at the mention as much as the others had ever seen a dwarf blanch Still Dagnabbit performed as instructed and with typical efficiency bringing the wagons in line from the ridge top to the plateau Bruenor had indicated When the dwarves had finished their bustling and jostling setting their teams in place and finding acceptable vantage points to hear the words of their leader Bruenor climbed up on a wagon and called out to them all Yere smellin ghosts and thats whats got ye itching he explained And ye should be smellin ghosts for the valley here is thick with them Ghosts o Delzoun dwarves long dead killed in battle by orcs He swept his arm out to the east to the wide pass opening before them And what a battle she was Hunnerds o yer ancestors died here me boys and thousands and thousands o their enemies But ye keep yerselfs strong in heart We won the Battle o Fell Pass and so if yere seeing any o them ghosts down there on our way through ye taunt it if its an orc and ye bow to it if its a dwarf The other friends from Icewind Dale watched Bruenor with sincere admiration noting how he added just the right inflections to his voice and emphasis on key words to hold his clan in deep attention He was acknowledging that there might be supernatural things down in the reputedly haunted valley yet if there was an ounce of fear in Bruenor Battlehammer he did not show it Now we couldve gone further south he went on Coulda swung along the northern edge o the Trollmoors and into Nesme He paused and shook his head then gave a great Bah Drizzt and the others surveyed the audience noting that many many bearded heads were bobbing in agreement with that dismissive sentiment But I knowed me boysd have little trouble walking among the dead heroes of old Bruenor finished Ye wont embarrass Clan Battlehammer Now ye get yer teams moving Well bring the wagons in a tight double line across the pass and if yere seeing a dwarf of old ye be remembering yer manners The army swung into precise action sorting the wagons and moving them along the trail down to the floor of the wide pass They tightened their ranks as Bruenor had instructed and rolled along twobytwo Before the last of the wagons had even begun moving one of the dwarves struck up a marching song a heroic tale of an ancient battle not unlike the one that had taken place in Fell Pass In moments all the line had joined in the song their voices strong and steady defeating the chilling atmosphere of the haunted place Even if there are ghosts about Drizzt whispered to Cattibrie theyll be too afraid to come out and bother this group Just to the side of them Delly was equally at ease with Wulfgar And ye keep telling me how ugly the road can be she scolded And here I was all afraid Wulfgar gave her a concerned look I never known a better place to be Delly said to him And how ye could eer have thought o giving up this life for one in the miserable city Im not for knowing Nor are we Cattibrie agreed drawing a surprised look from the barbarian She returned Wulfgars stare with a disarming smile Nor are we The wind moanedperhaps it was the wind perhaps something elsebut the sound seemed like a fitting accompaniment to the continuing song Many white stones covered the areaor at least the dwarves thought they were stones at first until one of them looked closer and realized that they were bones Ore bones and dwarf bones skulls and femurs some laying out in the open others halfburied Scattered about them were pieces of rusted metal broken swords and rotted armor It seemed like the former owners of both bones and armor might still be about as well for sometimes the wisps of strange fog seemed to take on definitive shapesthat of a dwarf perhaps or an orc Clan Battlehammer lost in the rousing song and following their unshakable leader merely saluted the former and sang all the louder growled away the latter and sang all the louder They set their camp that night wagons circled nervous horses brought right into the center with a ring of torches all around the tight perimeter Still the dwarves sang to ward off the ghosts that might be lurking nearby Ye dont go out this night Bruenor instructed Drizzt and Cattibrie and dont bring up yer stupid cat elf That brought him a couple of puzzled expressions No planeshifting around here Bruenor explained And thats what yer cat does You fear that Guenhwyvar will open a portal that unwelcome visitors might also use Talked to me priests and were all agreein its better not to find out Drizzt nodded and settled back All the more reason for me and Drizzt to go out and keep a scouting perimeter Cattibrie reasoned I aint suggesting that Why What do you know Bruenor Drizzt prompted He moved in closer and so did Cattibrie and so did Regis who was nearby and eavesdropping Shes a haunted pass to be sure Bruenor confided after taking a moment to look all around Full o yer ancestors said Cattibrie Full o worse than that said Bruenor Were to be finetoo many of us for even them ghosts to be playing with Im guessing Guessing Regis echoed skeptically Bruenor only shrugged and turned back to Drizzt Were needin to get an idea o all the land about he explained You think that Gauntlgrym is near Another shrug Doubtin thatitd be more toward Mirabarbut were likely to find some clues here That fight them centuries ago was going the orcs waya bad time for me ancestorsbut then the dwarves outsmarted them not a tough thing to do Theres tunnels all about this pass and deep caves some natural others cut by the Delzoun Me ancient kin interlocked them all and used them to supply to bind their wounds and to fix their weapons and for surprise for the dwarfs lured them stupid orcs in on what looked like a small group and when them ugly beasts came charging their tongues flapping outside their ugly mouths the Delzoun popped up from trapdoors all about them within their ranks Was still a fierce fight Them orcs can hit hard no ones doubting and many many o me ancestors died here but me kin won out Killed most o them orcs and sent the others running back to their holes in the deeper mountains Them caves are likely still down there holding secrets I mean to learn And holding nasties of many shapes and sizes Cattibrie added Someones gotta clear them nasties away Bruenor agreed Might as well be me You mean Hi Regis corrected Bruenor gave him a sly smile You plan to find a way down there and take the army underground Drizzt asked Nan Im plannin on passing through as I said Well go back to Mithral Hall and get through with the formalities then well decide how many we should be bringing back out after the next winter blows past Well see what we can find Then why go through here now Think about it elf Bruenor answered looking around at the encampment which seemed fairly calm and at ease despite their location Ye look danger right in the face at its worstor what yere thinking to be its worstright up front and yere not to be caught off yer guard by fear no more Indeed in looking around at the settled camp Drizzt understood exactly what Bruenor was driving at The night was not completely restful and more than once a sentry team cried out Ghost and the dwarves and others scrambled There were sightings and shrieks from unseen sources out in the darkness Despite their weariness from the road the clan did not get a good nights sleep but they were back on the move in the morning singing their songs denying fear as only a dwarf could Dreadmont and Skyfire Bruenor explained to his friends the next day pointing out two mountains one to the south and one to the north Markin the pass Ye take in every landmark elf Ill be needing yer ranger nose if were finding a place worth a return visit That day went uneventfully and the troupe passed another fitful but not overly so night and were back on the road before the dawn At midmorning they were rolling along at a brisk pace singing their songs from front to back the battleragers and other soldiers trotting along easily But then the wagon beside Bruenors lurched suddenly its back right wheel dropping and its front left coming right off the ground The horses reared and whinnied and the poor drivers fought hard to hold it steady Dwarves rushed in from the side grabbing on some trying to catch the cargo that was sliding off the back sliding into a gaping hole that was opening in the ground like a hungry mouth Drizzt rushed across in front of Bruenors wagon and darted back behind the frightened rearing horses who were being dragged back with the rest of the wagon His scimitars flashed repeatedly cutting loose the harness saving the team Cattibrie ran past the drow heading for the drivers and Wulfgar leaped from Bruenors wagon to join her The wagon fell backward into the hole taking the two struggling dwarves and the woman who had rushed to rescue them into the darkness Without even hesitating Wulfgar dived down to his chest at the lip of the hole and reached out catching the remains of the horse harness in his powerful hands The wagon wasnt falling free If it had been Wulfgar would have disappeared along with it Rather it was slipping down along a rocky shaft and enough of its weight was supported from below so that Wulfgar somehow managed to tentatively secure it The growling barbarian nearly let go in shock when a diminutive figure ran past him and leaped headlong into the hole and behind him Drizzt did cry out for Regis Then both noticed that the halfling was tethered and with Bruenor standing secure on his wagon holding the other end of the line Got them came a cry from below Dagnabbit and several other dwarves joined Bruenor taking up the line and locking it in place Cattibrie was the first to climb out along the lifeline followed in short order by the two shaken and bruised but not badly hurt drivers Rumblebelly Bruenor called when the other three were out with no sign of the halfling Lots of tunnels down here came Regis cry cut short by a shriek That was all the dwarf team had to hear and they began pumping their powerful arms hoisting a very shaken Regis from the hole Wulfgar could hold the wagon no longer It went crashing down disappearing from view until the clatter of its descent became a distant thing Whatd ye see Bruenor and many others yelled at Regis who was as white as an autumn cloud Regis shook his head his eyes wide and unblinking I thought it was you he said to one of the drivers I I went to hand you the rope It went right through I mean it didnt touch I mean Easy Rumblebelly Bruenor said patting the halfling on the shoulder Yere safe enough here and now Regis nodded but didnt seem convinced Off to the side Delly gave Wulfgar a huge hug and kiss Ye done good she whispered to him If ye hadnt caught the wagon then all three wouldve crashed down to their deaths Wulfgar looked past her to Cattibrie who was standing comfortably in Drizzts embrace but was looking Wulfgars way and nodding appreciatively Surveying the scene recognizing that many were thoroughly shaken Bruenor Battlehammer walked over to the edge of the hole put his hands on his hips and yelled down Hey ye damned ghosties Ye got nothing more about ye than a wisp of smoke A chorus of moans rolled out of the hole and dwarves scrambled away Not Bruenor though Oo ye got me shaking in me boots now he taunted Well if ye got something to say then get up here and say it Otherwise shut yer traps The moans stopped and for a short uncomfortable moment not a dwarf moved or made the slightest sound all of them wondering if Bruenors challenge was about to be met by a wave of attacking ghosts As the seconds slipped by and nothing ominous crawled out of the hole the troupe settled back Ye get Pwent and his boys tethered together on long lines and out in front stomping the ground as they go Bruenor instructed Dagnabbit Dont want to be losin any more wagons The team went back into action and Drizzt moved near his dwarf friend Challenging the dead he asked Bah they dont mean nothing with their booing and floating about Probably dont even know theyre dead True enough Mark well this spot elf Bruenor instructed Im thinking that it might be a good place to start our hunt for Gauntlgrym With that the unshakable Bruenor moved back to his wagon patted Regis on the shoulder one more time then led the clan forward as if nothing had happened Roll on Bruenor Battlehammer Drizzt whispered Dont he always Cattibrie asked moving beside the drow and wrapping her arm comfortably around his waist It took them three days to cross the broken ground of the Fell Pass The ghosts hovered around them every step of the way and the wind did not cease its mournful song Some areas were relatively clear but others were thick with remnants of that longago battle The signs werent always physical often just a general feeling of loss and pain a thick tangible aura of a land haunted by many lost souls Late that third day up high on one ridge Cattibrie spotted a distant welcomed sight a silvery river running through the land to the east like a giant snake The Surbrin Bruenor said with a smile when she told him and all heads about began to bob in recognition for the great River Surbrin passed only a few miles to the east of Mithral Hall and the dwarves had actually opened an eastern gate right along its banks Couple o days and well be home the dwarf explained and a great cheer went up for King Bruenor who had conquered the Fell Pass Im still not figuring why ye took us this way if yere just meaning to go home anyway Cattibrie confided to the dwarf as the excitement continued around them Because Im coming back out here and sore yerself the elf Rumblebelly and Wulfgar if hes wanting it And sore Dagnabbit and some o me best shield dwarves Now were knowing the ground and we learned it under the protection of an army Now we can start our looking Ye think the leaders in Mithral Hall are to let ye go out and run free Cattibrie asked Yere their king ye might be remembering Are they to let me Well Im their king ye might be remembering Bruenor shot back Im not thinking that Im needing anyones permission girl and so what makes ye think Im to be askin There wasnt really much that Cattibrie could say against that Aint ye supposed to be out hunting with Drizzt Bruenor asked He took Regis with him today Cattibrie answered and she looked to the north as if she expected to spot the pair running along a distant ridgeline The halfling howl about going No He asked if he could go Still wonderin whats got into Rumblebelly Bruenor admitted with a shake of his hairy head Regis once the lover of comfort did indeed seem transformed He had pressed on through the bitter cold of winter in the Spine of the World without complaint indeed even lending rousing words for his friends In every action the halfling had tried to get involved to somehow help out whereas the Regis of old seemed amazingly adept at finding an out of the way shadow The change was somehow unsettling to Bruenor and to all the others a shifting of the sand beneath the world as they had known it At least it seemed to be shifting in a positive direction Not so far away Wulfgar came upon Delly as she watched Cattibrie and Bruenor in their private discussion The barbarian noted that his wife was focusing almost exclusively on Cattibrie as if taking a measure of the woman He walked up behind her and wrapped his huge arms around her waist She is a fine companion he said I can see why ye loved her Wulfgar gently turned Delly around to face him I did not Oh sure ye did and stop trying to save me feelings Wulfgar stammered over a couple of responses not knowing how he should respond She is a companion to me on the road in battle And in all yer life Delly finished No Wulfgar insisted Once I thought that I desired such a joining but now I see the world differently Now I see you and Colson and know that I am complete Who said ye werent You just said I said that yer Cattibrie was a companion in all yer life and so she is and so yere better off for it Delly corrected Ye dont be pullinher back from yerself for me own sake I do not wish to hurt you Delly turned around to regard Cattibrie Nor does she Shes yer friend and Im liking it that way She pulled away from Wulfgar but stood back and stared at him a sincere smile wide on her pretty face To be sure theres a part o me fearing that yell want her for more than friendship I cant be helping that but Im not to be giving in to it I trust ye and trust in what me and ye have started here but dont ye be putting Cattibrie away from yerself in trying to protect me because thats not where she belongs Most folksd be glad to have a friend like her And I am Wulfgar admitted He looked curiously at Delly Why are you saying this now Delly couldnt suppress her telling grin Bruenors talking about coming back out here Hes hoping that yell be joining him My place is with you and Colson Delly was shaking her head even as he started that predictable response Yer place is with me and our girl when yer life permits Yer place is on the road with Bruenor and Drizzt and Cattibrie and Regis Im knowing that and it makes me love ye all the more Their road is a dangerous one Wulfgar reminded Then more the reason for ye to help them along it Theyre dwarfs Nikwillig exclaimed his voice breaking with excitement and relief Tred who had not climbed the last part of the steep boulder tumble and so could not see the huge caravan rolling along the flat ground to the south leaned back against a rock and put his head in his hands His left leg was swollen and would not bend He hadnt realized how badly it had been torn during their respite in the small village and he knew that he would not be able to go on for much longer without some proper tending maybe even some divine intervention courtesy of a cleric Of course Tred hadnt complained at all and had fought with every ounce of his strength to keep up with Nikwillig in their flight It had been a strong and valiant run but both dwarves knew they were nearing the end of their endurance They needed a break and apparently one had found them We can catch them if we angle out to the southeast Nikwillig explained Ye up for one more run We need to make the run we make the run Tred said Aint come this far to lay down and die Nikwillig nodded and turned around gingerly beginning the steep descent He stopped though freezing in place his eyes locked across the way Tred noted that look and followed that gaze to see a huge panther black as the night sky crouched on a ledge not so far awaynot far enough away Dont ye move Nikwillig whispered Tred didnt even bother to answer thinking exactly the same thing though he understood that the great cat knew exactly where they were He pondered what he might do if the cat sprang his way How could he even begin to hurt that mass of muscle and claws Well he decided if it comes on it goes away bloody The seconds slipped past neither the cat nor the dwarves moving an inch With a growl that seemed a challenge Tred pushed out from the wall to stand straight and strong and put his heavy axe up at the ready beside him The great panther looked his way but not threateningly In fact the cat seemed almost bored Please dont throw that at her came a voice from below and to the side and the two dwarves glanced down to see a brownhaired halfling moving out onto an open flat stone When Guenhwyvar gets an invitation to play its hard to stop her That yer cat Tred asked Not mine no the halfling answered She a friend and mastered by a friend if you get my meaning Tred nodded Well who are ye then I could be asking you the same question the halfling answered In fact I believe that I will And yell be getting yer answer after were getting ours The halfling bowed low Regis of Mithral Hall he said Friend to King Bruenor Battlehammer and scout for the caravan your friend sees below Returning from Icewind Dale Tred relaxed and so did Nikwillig The King o Mithral Hall keeps strange company Tred remarked Stranger than you would ever believe Regis was quick to answer He glanced to the side and so did both dwarves to see a second dark figure this one not feline but a drow elf Tred nearly fell over Above him Nikwillig did slip a bit barely catching a hold before he tumbled from the climb You still have not told me your name Regis reminded and I am guessing that youre not from around here if youve not heard of Drizzt DoUrden and his panther Guenhwyvar Wait I heared o him Nikwillig said from above Tred and Tred looked up Bruenors friend drow Yeah we heared o that And pray tell us where you were when you heard Drizzt prompted Nikwillig moved down fast dropping beside Tred and both dwarves set themselves more presentably with Nikwillig brushing some of the road dust from his weathered tunic Tred McKnuckless me name Tred announced and thiss me friend Nikwillig outta Citadel Felbarr and the kingdom o Emerus Warcrown Long way from home Drizzt observed Longer than yere thinking Tred answered Been a road o orcs and giants and one wrong trail leading to another wrong trail A tale well worth hearing I am sure Drizzt replied but not here and not now Let us get you down to Bruenor and the others Bruenors in that caravan Nikwillig asked Returning from Icewind Dale to assume the throne of Mithral Hall for word reached us that Gandalug Battlehammer is dead Moradin put him to work at his anvil said Tred a customary blessing for dead dwarves Drizzt nodded Indeed And may Moradin guide Bruenor well And may Moradin or whatever good god is listening guide us well back to the caravan Regis reminded When Drizzt and the others regarded the halfling they saw that he was looking around nervously as if he expected that Tred and Nikwillig had led a host of giants to the ridge giants that were preparing to rain stones on the five of them Keep scouting Guenhwyvar Drizzt instructed and he started toward the dwarves Both of the bearded fellows instinctively stiffened and the perceptive drow stopped his approach Regis you accompany them to Bruenor Drizzt decided I will keep the perimeter with Guenhwyvar He saluted the dwarves and slipped away and both Tred and Nikwillig visibly relaxed Were safe with Drizzt and Guenhwyvar flanking us Regis assured the dwarves as he approached Safer than you can imagine Tred and Nikwillig looked at each other then back at the halfling and nodded though neither seemed overly confident in Regiss words Dont worry the halfling said offering an understanding wink Youll get used to him So SMARTER THAN AN ORC THOUGHT The arrival of the two dwarves brought much excitement to the village of Clicking Heels and that deep into the wilds of the Spine of the World excitement was not usually welcomed After the two dwarves had gone on their way the villagers settled back from the initial fear that they would be attacked and began to savor the story Excitement within a larger cocoon of safety was always welcomed Still the villagers of Clicking Heels were seasoned enough to not fall too deeply into that cocoon They limited their outoftown travel over the next few days and doubled the daytime watch and tripled the nighttime watch All through the nights at short regular intervals the sentries would call out All clear from one checkpoint to another Everyone kept his eyes peeled to the cleared ground around the village walls with that special vigilance that could only be learned through harsh experience Even toward the end of the first tenday after the dwarves departure the watch held strong and steady with no slacking no sleeping or even dozing along the wall Carelman Twopennies one of the sentries that particular night seven days after Nikwillig and Tred had gone on their way was tired and so he wouldnt even lean against a pole for fear that he would nod off Every time he heard the all clear call circling along the wall to his right the man shook his head briskly and strained his eyes toward the dark field beyond his section of wall ready for his turn to yell out Soon after midnight the calls circling Carelman did just that and peering into the emptiness beyond he was fairly certain that his impending call would be an honest one When it came to his turn he yelled out or started to All clear He heard a rush of air above him as the words began to leave his mouth though and was merely unfortunate enough to be standing in the way of the giantthrown boulder and so his All clear came out as All cleaugh He felt the explosion for just an instant then he was dead lying on the ground beneath the rubble of the wooden parapet and the heavy stone Carelman Twopennies didnt hear the cries erupting around him or the subsequent explosions as heavy boulders smashed through the walls and buildings softening the defenses of the small village He didnt hear the shouts of alarm after that as a horde of orcs many riding fierce worgs swept down upon the battered town He didnt hear the deaths of his family his friends his home Marchion Elastul stroked his wild red whiskers a movement that many dwarves took as a proud gesture one used for showing off ones beard Of course Torgar wasnt overly impressed by the red whiskers of the human marchion for no human could grow a beard to match the worst of dwarf beards What am I to do with you Torgar Hammerstriker Elastul asked Behind him his four guardsmen the Hammers bristled and whispered amongst themselves Didnt think ye was to do anything with me your honorness the dwarf answered Been going about me business in Mirabar since before ye was born and before yer daddy was born Im not needing ye to do much The marchions sour look showed that he was not overly impressed with the statement or the notsosubtle reminder that Torgar had been in service to Mirabar for a long long time It is just that heritage that brings me a quandary Elastul explained Quandary Torgar asked and he scratched his own beard That a place where ye get both rocks and milk The marchions face screwed up with confusion A dilemma he explained What is asked the dwarf Torgar worked hard to hide his grin One thing he knew about humans was that they carried an internal superiority belief and playing dumb was the easiest way a dwarf could deflect ire What is what the marchion replied Yeah that Enough the marchion cried He was visibly trembling to which Torgar only shrugged as if he understood none of it Your actions present me with a dilemma Hows that The people of Mirabar look up to you Youre one of the most trusted commanders in the Axe a dwarf of fine reputation and honor Bah Marchion Elastul yere bringing a blush to me bearded cheeks and to me other ones as well He finished the sentence by twisting to look over his shoulder Though Im guessing them nether onesre becoming about as hairy as old age begins to set in Elastul looked as if he wanted to slap himself across the face which pleased Torgar greatly The man gave a great sigh and started to respond but the door to the audience chamber banged open and Sceptrana Shoudra Stargleam entered Marchion she greeted with a bow We are discussing whether or not I should have you melt the Axe symbol off of Torgars armor the marchion replied throwing aside Torgars distracting remarks We are the dwarf asked innocently Enough Elastul scolded again You know well enough that we are and you know well enough why I have summoned you here To think that you of all dwarves would go consorting with our enemies Torgar held up his stubbyfingered hands his expression going suddenly grim Ye take care on who yere calling our enemies he warned Elastul Need I remind you of the wealth that Bruenor Battlehammer and his dwarves have stolen from us Bah theyve stolen not a thing I made me a couple o pretty deals from where Im looking Not their caravan Their mines to the cast Need I remind you of the drop in business since Mithral Halls forges began to burn once more Ask Shoudra there She above all others can tell you of the difficulty in renewing contracts and attracting new buyers True enough the woman added Since the return of Mithral Hall my job has become far more difficult As have all of our jobs Torgar agreed And thatll make us better from where Im looking Clan Battlehammer is no friend of Mirabar Elastul declared Nor are they our enemy Torgar replied and ye should be careful afore ye go callin them such The marchion came forward in his chair so suddenly that Torgar reflexively brought a hand up by his right shoulder near to the hilt of the large axe he always kept strapped across his back and that movement in turn made the marchion and his four Hammers start and widen their eyes King Bruenor came in as a friend Torgar remarked when things had settled a bit He came here on his way through as a friend and he was let in as a friend Or to take a measure of his greatest rivals Shoudra remarked but Torgar just shrugged that thought away And if yere letting a dwarf legend into yer city then how can ye be sayin the dwarves o yer city cant go and sit with him Many of the dwarves of my city are among the loudest voices for espionage against King Bruenors Mithral Hall Elastul reminded You have heard their calls for spies to go into Mithral Hall and find some way to shut down the forges or to flood some of the more promising tunnels or to place cheaper goods in among the armor and weapons Clan Battlehammer is sending out to market Torgar couldnt deny the truth of the marchions words nor the fact that he himself had uttered similar curses against Mithral Hall in the past but that seemed different to him than this personal visit a rant against a faceless rival Torgar might not wish Clan Battlehammer well with their merchandising but if an enemy came against Bruenor and his clan Torgar would gladly lead a charge to assist them Ye ever think that we might be going against Clan Battlehammer in the wrong way the dwarf asked The marchion and Shoudra exchanged curious looks Ye ever think that we might be using their strengths and our own strength together to the benefit of us all What do you mean Elastul asked They got the orebetter ore than well be findin here if we dig a hunnerd miles downand they got some great craftsmen dont ye doubt but so do we Might that our best and their best could work with their good ore to make great pieces while our apprentices and their apprentices or a few whore too old to see it right or lift the hammer well enough could work with the lesser ore in making the lesser piecesrailings and cart wheels instead o swords and breastplates if ye see me meaning The marchions eyes went wide indeed but not because he was the least bit intrigued by the suggestion of cooperation Torgar saw that immediately and knew that he had crossed a line Trembling so badly that he seemed as if he might vibrate right out of his chair Elastul forced himself with great effort to settle back He shook his head seeming too enraged to even speak a denial Just a thought Torgar remarked A thought Here is a thoughtwhy dont we have Shoudra burn that axe from your breastplate Why dont I have you dragged out and flogged publicly perhaps even tried for treason against Mirabar How dare you lead so many into the embrace of King Bruenor Battlehammer How dare you bring comfort to our principle rival a dwarf who leads a clan that has cost us piles of gold How dare you represent any prospect of friendship between Mithral Hall and Mirabar and how dare you suggest such a thing to me Shoudra Stargleam came forward to the side of the marchions throne She put her hand on Elastuls arm obviously trying to calm him She looked to Torgar as she did and nodded toward the door to the room motioning for him to make a fast exit But Torgar wasnt ready to leave just yet not before he had the last word Ye might be hatin Bruenor and his boys and ye might have reason he said but Im secin it more as our own weakness than anything Bruenor and his boys did to us Marchion Elastul started to respond with another how dare you but Torgar kept on rolling Thats the way Im secin it the dwarf stated flatly Ye want to take me Axe emblem then take it but if yere thinking o7 flogging me then ye should be looking more closely at me kin With that threat hanging in the air Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker turned and stormed from the room I will have his head on a pike Then youll have two thousand shield dwarves running wild in Mirabar Shoudra explained She was still holding the mans arm and firmly I dont completely disagree with any of the things you say about Mithral Hall good Elastul but given the response from Torgar and many others I wonder the wisdom of holding our present course of open animosity Elastul shot her an angry and threatening glower the look alone reminding her that few on the Council of Sparkling Stones would side with her reasoning So Shoudra let him go and stepped back bowing her head deferentially while silently wondering how destabilizing King Bruenors visit had truly been to Mirabar If the marchion kept pushing this hard the result could be disastrous for the ancient mining city Shoudra also silently applauded King Bruenor for his shrewd move of even showing up where he knew he would not be welcomed but where he would neither be flatly rebuked Yes it was a cunning maneuver and it seemed to the Sceptrana of Mirabar that her boss was playing right into Bruenors hands Prisoners Obould asked his son as they stood overlooking the ruins of Clicking Heels Few left Urlgen said with an evil grin Yere interrogating Urlgen straightened as if the thought hadnt occurred to him Obould gave a growl and slapped Urlgen on the back of his head What we need to know the confused Urlgen asked Whatever they can tell us to help us Obould explained speaking slowly and articulating each word carefully as if he was addressing a toddler Urlgen snarled but didnt voice his displeasure The insult had been earned after all Ye know how to interrogate Obould asked and his son looked at him as if the question was purely ridiculous Just like torture Obould explained anyway except ye ask them questions while ye play Urlgens lips curled into a perfectly evil smile and with a nod he headed back into the village where many of his warriors were already at play on the few unfortunate villagers who had not died in the attack An hour later Urlgen caught up to his father finding Obould at parlay with the giants who had helped in the raid playing the political angles as always Not all them dwarfs got killed when we hit them Urlgen remarked his tone a mixture of excitement for the chase and disappointment Dwarfs There were dwarfs in that stupid little town Urlgen seemed confused Not them dwarfs he said Werent none of them dwarfs Now Obould and the giants seemed confused No dwarfs in the town Urlgen stated clearly trying to end the circular confusion When we hit them dwarfs a tenday ago two got away It wasnt completely surprising to Obould for they knew that some dwarves at least were running around the region A band of orcs had been slaughtered not too far from this town with tactics indicating a dwarven ambush They come in there and hurt Urlgen explained And they died in there Nope kept runnin looking for Mithral Hall and were gone before we hit How long Not long Obould wore an excited expression A fun hunt he asked the giants and as one the great blueskinned behemoths nodded But Oboulds expression quickly changed as he remembered the warnings of Adnon Kareese Small forays and with restraint We draw them out little by little the drow had said Chasing these dwarves to the south would bring the force dangerously close to Mithral Hall perhaps and might incite a battle far beyond what Obould wanted Nah let em go the orc king decided and while the giants seemed to accept that readily enough Urlgens eyes popped open so wide that they seemed as if they would fall right out of his ugly head Ye cant be the younger and rasher orc started to argue I can be Obould interrupted Ye let em make the hall with their tales o death and destruction and the dwarfs therell send out a force to investigate Thatd be a bigger and better fight Urlgens smile began to widen once more and Obould let him in on the rest of the reasoning just for prudence After all any mention of Mithral Hall might send the young warriors charging headlong to the south We get too close and start that fight and some o them dwarfs might get back home and all the stinkin Mithral Hallll empty out on us and thats a fight were not wantin Despite the nods of agreement even from sour Urlgen Obould felt obliged to add Not yet THE TRAPPINGS OF Bruenor purposely excluded Thibbledorf Pwent from the meeting with the two dwarves of Citadel Felbarr knowing the gist of their story beforehand from Regis and knowing that the battlerager would likely charge right off into the mountains to avenge their fallen Felbarr kin And so Nikwillig and Tred recounted their adventures to a group that was comprised more of nondwarvesDrizzt Cattibrie Wulfgar and Registhan dwarves A fine escape Bruenor congratulated when the pair had finished Ye done Emerus Warcrown proud Both Tred and Nikwillig puffed up a bit at the compliment from the dwarf king Whatre ye thinking Bruenor asked directing the question to Dagnabbit The younger dwarf considered the question carefully for a long while then answered Ill take me a group o warriors including the Gutbuster Brigade and backtrack the route to the Surbrin in the north If we find the raiders well crush em and come home If not well tack south along the river and meet up with ye in Mithral Hall Bruenor nodded throughout the recitation of the plan expecting every word Dagnabbit was good but he was also predictable Id be likin another shot at them killers Tred interjected His words made Nikwillig who obviously didnt share the sentiment look more than a little uncomfortable Forgettin yer hurt leg Nikwillig remarked Bah Bruenors priests done me good with their warm hands Tred insisted and to accentuate the point the dwarf stood up and began hopping around and indeed despite a wince or two he seemed ready for the road Bruenor studied the pair for a moment Well we cant let ye both get killed or yer talell not be told proper to Emerus Warcrown So ye can come on the hunt Tred and yerself Nikwillig will go back to Mithral Hall with the others King Bruenor yer words make ye sound like yere headin out on the hunt yerself Dagnabbit remarked drawing a hard stare from Bruenor Bruenor knew the expectations of those around him particularly of Dagnabbit who was sworn to secure his kings safety He knew that the proper course for him as King of Mithral Hall would be to head south straightaway with the bulk of his force back to the security of his kingdom back where he could direct further counterstrikes in search of this marauding band of orcs and giants That was what was expected of him but the mere thought of it made Bruenors gut churn He looked over at Drizzt with a pleading look and the dark elf offered a slight knowing nod in response Whatre ye thinking elf Bruenor asked T would have an easier time finding the monsters than Pwent and his wild band Drizzt replied An easier time even than good Dagnabbit here though I doubt not his prowess at hunting orcs Then ye come with me Dagnabbit offered There was a slight crack in his voice showing that he saw where this might be heading and showing that he was not too pleased by the prospect T will go Drizzt agreed but with my friends around me Those whom I have come to trust the most Those who best recognize how to compliment my every move He nodded in turn to Cattibrie to Wulfgar and to Regis then paused for a moment and turned directly to Bruenorand nodded A smile widened on the face of the dwarf king No no no Dagnabbit remarked immediately Ye cannot be taking me king into the wilds I believe the choice is Bruenors to make my friend not yours and not mine Drizzt replied He returned Bruenors grateful smile and asked the king One last hunt Who says its the last came Bruenors gruff reply The friends chuckled then laughed all the harder when Dagnabbit stomped his heavy boot on the ground and exclaimed Dagnabbit Bah but yerself can come along ye dumb dwarf Bruenor said to his young commander And yerself he added looking over at Tred who nodded grimly And ye bring some fighters with ye Dagnabbit insisted Pwent and his boys said Bruenor No Dagnabbit shouted emphatically But you just said That was afore I thinked yerself was goin Bruenor patted his hands in the air to calm the excited dwarf Not Pwent then he said understanding his young commanders concern Pwent could start a fight with a rock so it was said in Mithral Hall and hurt himself and everyone around him badly before he won the scuffle Ye pick the group yerself Twenty o yer best Twentyfive Dagnabbit argued Well get em ready soon Bruenor said to Dagnabbit and to all of them Im wanting to be on the road this same day We got orcs and giants to squish The dwarf looked around at all his friends and noted that Wulfgars grin was not as wide as those of Drizzt Cattibrie and even Regis Bruenor nodded his understanding to his adopted son his implied permission for Wulfgar now a father and a husband to opt out of the hunt if he saw fit to do so Wulfgar tightened his jaw in response returned the nod and strode away Ye cant be thinkin what Im thinkin yere thinkin said Shingles McRuff He was one of the toughest looking critters in all of Mirabar a short and exceedingly stout dwarf whose nasty attitude was always clearly shown on his ruddy weathered face He was missing an eye and simply never bothered to fill in the empty socket just covered it with an eye patch Half of his black beard was torn away the right side of his face showing as one big scar Well Im thinkin what Im thinkin Torgar Hammerstriker replied and Im not knowin what yere thinkin Im thinkin Well Im thinkin that yere thinkin o leavin Shingles slated bluntly and that got the attention of all the other dwarves in the crowded tavern in the highest subterranean level of the city Dont know what the marchion said to ye bud but Im betting it aint nothing next to what yer grandpad be sayin to ye if yer grandpa was still here to be sayin things to ye Torgar threw up his hands and waved away the words and the looks of all the others At least he tried to for several other dwarves moved in close pulling up chairs and more than one started the same question Ye heading out o Mirabar Torgar Torgar ran his hands through his thick hair Course I aint ye durned fools he said rather unconvincingly Me fathers fathers fathers fathers father spent his days here Despite his bluster even Torgar could recognize the hint of doubt in his own statements and that made him ask himself if he really was thinking of leaving Mirabar He was as mad as a demon at Elastul to be sure but was there really a notion deep in his head and deep in his heart that it might be time for him to end the Hammerstriker dynasty in Mirabar He ran his hands through his thick hair again and again and ended up shouting Bah in the faces of those around him He stood up so forcefully that his chair skidded out behind him and he stomped away grabbing a flagon of ale from the bar as he passed and tossing back a coin to the obviously amused tavern keeper Out in the cavern that housed the cluster of buildings in the First Below the highest section of Mirabars UndercityTorgar looked all around him noting the structures and noting the striations of the stone that housed them stone so familiar to him that he felt as if it was a part of him and of his heritage Stupid Elastul he muttered under his breath Stupid all o ye not seem King Bruenor and his boys for the friends they be He walked away unaware that his last statements had been overheard by several others including Shingles all huddled near the open window of the tavern Hes meanin it another dwarf remarked And Im thinkin that hes gonna go said another Bah whaddya know aside from which drink yere drinkin Shingles blustered at them If yere even knowin which drink yere drinkin Im knowing shouted another dwarf from across the way So Im thinkin that Im not drinkin enough o what Im drinkin That brought a roar and cries of rounds from several parts of the tavern Shingles McRuff just grinned at them all though and kept looking out the window though Torgar his old buddy and comrade at arms was long out of sight Despite his disclaimer and Torgars denial Shingles could not disagree with the consensus that Torgar was indeed serious about leaving Mirabar The arrival of King Bruenor and the boys from Mithral Hall had put a face on a previously faceless enemy a face that Torgar and many others had come to see as a friend A rival perhaps but certainly no enemy The treatment Elastul and the other leaders mostly human had shown to Bruenor and to the Mirabarran dwarves who had gone to hear Bruenors tales or buy the wares from Icewind Dale had not set well with Torgar or with many others For the first time since the incident Shingles McRuff seriously considered the recent events and the wider implications of them He didnt much like where his thoughts were suddenly and already leading him Guilts a funny thing now aint it Delly Curtie playfully asked Wulfgar when he returned to her and Colson at their wagon Guilt came the skeptical response Or an understanding of my responsibilities Guilt Delly answered without the slightest hesitation In taking on a family I accepted the responsibility of protecting that family And what do ye think will happen to me and Colson surrounded by two hundred friendly dwarves Yere not abandoning us out in the wilds Wulfgar Were going to safety Tis yerself thats walking to danger And even in that I am abandoning my respons Oh dont ye start that again Delly interrupted and loudly drawing the attention of several nearby dwarves Ye do as ye must Ye live the life ye were meant to live You came all the way out here with me Livin the life Im choosin to live Delly explained Im not wanting to lose yenot for a momentbut T know that if ye abandon yer heart to stand with me and Colson all the day then Ive already lost ye Come to Mithral Hall if thats whats truly in yer heart me love but if not then get yerself out on the road with Bruenor and th others And what if I die out there away from you It was not a question asked out of fear for Wulfgar was not afraid of dying out on the road He was an adventurer a warrior and as long as he could hold faith that he was following the true course of his life then whatever was put before him would be acceptable Of course he wouldnt die on the road without a fight I think about it all the time Delly admitted because Im knowin that yeve got to be going And if ye die on the road then know that yer Colson will be proud o her daddy For a bit I thinked about changing yer heart about tricking ye into staying by me side but thats not who ye are I see it on yer facea face thats smiling all the wider when the wild wind is blowin across it Me and Colson can accept whatever fate ye find at the end o yer road Wulfgar son of Beornegar so long as yere walking the road of yer heart She moved up close as she spoke kneeling in front of the sitting Wulfgar and draping her arms over his shoulders Just give an orc a good smack for me will ya Wulfgar was smiling then as he looked into her sparkling eyes sparkling more than they ever had back in the days when Delly had worked in Arumns tavern in the seedy bowels of Luskan Something about the road the fresh air the adventure the child had gotten into the woman and Delly seemed to grow more beautiful more wholesome more healthy with every passing day Wulfgar pulled her close and hugged her tightly His thoughts went back to the day when Robillard had dropped him in the center of Luskan presenting him with two choices the road south and security beside Delly and Colson or the road north to join his friends in adventure Hearing Dellys words the sincerity in her voice the love and admiration accompanying it Wulfgar was never more glad of his choice of that northward turn and never more sure of himself And never more in love with this woman who had become his wife I will give him two good smacks for you Wulfgar answered and he moved in to kiss his wife Nah Delly said pulling back teasingly Yer first onell send him flyin far enough She didnt move away again as Wulfgars lips found hers in a long and leading kiss gentle at first but then pressing more urgently The barbarian started to stand easily lifting the lithe Delly up with him guiding her to the privacy of their covered wagon Colson woke up then and started to cry Wulfgar and Delly could only laugh Thibbledorf Pwent hopped around uttering a series of sounds that amply reflected his frustration and disappointment and kicking at every stone he passed even those far too big to be kicked Still if the tough dwarf felt any pain he didnt show it much just an occasional grunt within the steady stream of curses and an added hop here or there after a particularly vicious kick at a particularly stubborn rock Finally after circling King Bruenor for many minutes of random cursing Pwent hopped to a stop and put his stubby hands on his hips Yere going for a fight and a fights where me and me boys belong Were going to pay back a small band o orcs and a couple o giants Bruenor corrected Wont be much of a fight and even less o one if Pwent and his boys are there Its what we do And too well Bruenor cried Pwents eyes widened Huh Ye durned fool Bruenor scolded Dont ye see that thisll be me last time When we get back to Mithral Hall Ill be the king again and what a boring title that is Whatre ye talkin about Yere the best king Bruenor silenced him with a wave and an exaggerated look of disgust Talkin with lying emissaries making pretty with fancy fool lords and fancier and more foolish ladies Ye think Ill get to use me axe much in the next hunnerd years Only if another army o damned drow come aknocking at our doors So now I get the chance one last chance and yere thinking to steal all me fun with yer killer band And I thinked ye was me friend That set Pwent back on his heels putting the whole situation in a light he had never begun to imagine I am yer friend King Bruenor Pwent said somberly as reserved as Bruenor or anyone else had ever seen him FU be takin me boys back to Mithral Hall to get the place ready for yer arrival He paused and offered Bruenor a sly wink well it was intended to be sly at least but from Pwent it just came out as an exaggerated twitch And Im hopin ye wont be back anytime soon Pwent went on with more comprehension than Bruenor had expected Might be just one small band that hit the boys from Felbarr but might be that yell find a bunch o other small bands betwixt here and that one and a bunch more on yer way back home Good fighting King Bruenor May ye notch yer axe a thousand more times afore ye see yer shining halls once more With great cheering and fanfare promises of death to the orcs and giants and eternal friendship between Mithral Hall and Citadel Felbarr the band of Bruenor and his dear friends along with Dagnabbit Tred and twentyfive stout warriors moved off from the main group turning north into the mountains Dwarves were not a bloodthirsty race but they knew how to celebrate when the occasion was a war against goblinkind and giantkin their most hated of foes As for the friends as one even Regis they felt energized and refreshed to be on the road to adventure once again and so the only regrets that fine morning were felt by those who had not been chosen to go For the dark elf it was old times and new times all rolled together the same camaraderie that had so enriched his life of recent years his old band marching together into adventure in rugged lands and yet with a better understanding of each other and of their respective places in the world The day was full of promise indeed What Drizzt DoUrden did not understand was that he was walking headlong into the saddest day of his life I am not afraid to die There I said it I admitted it to myself I am not afraid to die nor have I been since the day I walked out of Menzoberranzan Only now have I come to fully appreciate that fact and only because of a very special friend named Bruenor Battlehammer It is not bravado that makes such words flow from my lips Not some needed show of courage and not some elevation of myself above any others It is the simple truth I am not afraid to die I do not wish to die and I hold faith that I will fight viciously against any attempts to kill me Ill not run foolishly into an enemy encampment with no chance of victory though my friends often accuse me of just that and even the obvious fact that we are not yet dead does not dissuade them from their barbs Nay I hope to live for several centuries I hope to live forever with my dear friends all about me every step of that unending journey So why the lack of fear I understand well enough that the road I willingly walkindeed the road I choose to walkis fraught with peril and presents the very real possibility that one day perhaps soon I or my friends will be slain And while it would kill me to be killed obviously and kill me even more to see great harm come to any of my dear friends I will not shy from this road Nor will they And now I know why And now because of Bruenor I understand why I am not afraid to die Before I expected that my lack of fear was due to some faith in a higher being a deity an afterlife and there remains that comforting hope That is but a part of the equation though and a part that is based upon prayers and blind faith rather than the certain knowledge of that which truly sustains me which truly guides me which truly allows me to take every step along the perilous road with a profound sense of inner calm I am not afraid to die because I know that I am part of a something a concept a belief that is bigger than all that is me body and soul When I asked Bruenor about this road away from Mithral Hall that he has chosen I put the question simply what will the folk of Mithral Hall do if you are killed on the road His answer was even more simple and obvious theyll do better then than if I went home and hid That s the way of the dwarvesand it is an expectation they place upon all of their leaders Even the overprotective ones such as the consummate bodyguard Pwent understand deep down that if they truly shelter Bruenor they have in effect already slain the King of Mithral Hall Bruenor recognizes that the concept of Mithral Hall a theocracy that is in fact a subtle democracy is bigger than the dwarf whoever it might be who is presently occupying the throne And Bruenor recognizes that kings before him and kings after him will die in battle tragically with the dwarves they leave behind caught unprepared for his demise But countering that seeming inevitability in the end is that the concept that is Mithral Hall will rise from the ashes of the funeral pyre When the drow came to Mithral Hall as when any enemy in the past ever threatened the place Bruenor as king stood strong and forthright leading the charge Indeed it was Bruenor Battlehammer and not some warrior acting on his behalf who slew Matron Baenre herself the finest notch he ever put into that nasty axe of his That is the place of a dwarf king because a dwarf king must understand that the kingdom is more important than the king that the clan is bigger than the king that the principles of the clans existence are the correct principles and are bigger than the mortal coil of king and commoner alike If Bruenor didnt believe that if he couldnt honestly look his enemies coldly in the eye without fear for his own safety then Bruenor should not be King of Mithral Hall A leader who hides when danger reveals itself is no leader at all A leader who thinks himself irreplaceable and invaluable is a fool But I am no leader so how does this apply to me and my chosen road Because I know in my heart that I walk a road of truth a road of the best intentions if sometimes those intentions are misguided a road that to me is an honest one I believe that my way is the correct way for me at least and in my heart if I ever do not believe this then I must work hard to alter my course Many trials present themselves along this road Enemies and other physical obstacles abound of course but along with them come the pains of the heart In despair I traveled back to Menzoberranzan to surrender to the drow so that they would leave my friends alone and in that most basic of errors I nearly cost the woman who is most dear to me her very life I watched a confused and tired Wulfgar walk away from our group and feared he was walking into danger from which he would never emerge And yet despite the agony of that parting I knew that I had to let him go At times it is hard to hold confidence that the chosen fork in the road is the right one The image of Ellifain dying will haunt me forever I fear yet I hold in retrospect the understanding that there was nothing I could have truly done differently Even now knowing the dire consequences of my actions on that fateful day half a century ago I believe that I would follow the same course the one that my heart and my conscience forced upon me For that is all that I can do all that anyone can do The inner guidance of conscience is the best marker along this difficult road even if it is not foolproof I will follow it though I know so well now the deep wounds I might find For as long as I believe that I am walking the true road if I am slain then I die in the knowledge that for a brief period at least I was part of something bigger than Drizzt DoUrden I was part of the way it should be No drow no man no dwarf could ever ask for more than that I am not afraid to die Drizzt DoUrden AROUND THE EDGES OF DISASTER Were lost the yellowbearded dwarf roared He took a threatening step forward nearly tripping over his long wagging beard He was a squareshouldered creature with hardly a neck to speak of and a face full of exaggerated features a huge nose long and wide a great mouth of large teeth showing under the pronounced yellow whiskers and wild dark eyes set in wide sockets seeming all the wilder as he wound up into one of his more animated moods Though his heavy plate mail was lying by the bedrolls he still wore his great helm fashioned of metal and the towering antlers of a tenpoint deer How can we be lost ye danged fool he said Ye got all them birds leadin ye dont ye The other dwarf his older brother shrugged and gave a plaintive Oooo sound He looked down at his feet clad in sandals and not the typical heavy dwarven boots and kicked a nearby rock sending it bouncing into the brush Ye said ye could get me there Ivan Bouldershoulder roared on A shortcut Yeah a danged shortcut thats got us somewhere Near to Mithral Hall No But somewhere and yere right ye stupid doodad ye got us here fast The blustering dwarf stood up straight and adjusted his battered chain mail jerkin fixing the bandoleer of tiny crossbow bolts that crossed from his left shoulder to his right hip Tick tick lick boom his brother warned for the hundredth time waggling a finger at those special crossbow bolts each fitted with a small vial of oil of impact In response the angry Ivan drew out a handheld crossbow an exact replica of the kind favored by the dark elves of the Underdark and waggled it back at Pikel Boom yerself ye stupid doodad Pikels eyes rolled up into his head and he whispered a quick chant Before Ivan could tell him to knock it off a small branch snapped down at the yellowbearded dwarfs extended arm enwrapping the wrist and tugging back up to put Ivan on the tips of his toes Ye dont want to play like this Ivan warned Not now No boom Pikel said firmly waggling his finger like a scolding mother He seemed perfectly ridiculous of course as he usually did with his long greendyed beard parted in the middle and pulled up over his large ears then braided together with his long hair to run halfway down his back He wore light green robes layered and tied with a thick rope at his waist and with voluminous sleeves that hung down over his hands if he held his arms at his side Ivan gave a little laugh one that promised his older brother that hed be meeting a fist very soon Pikel just ignored him and walked to the side of their small encampment where a bowl of vegetable stew was boiling over the fire The pair had been out of the Spirit Soaring cathedral in the mountains above the small town of Carradoon for more than a tenday accepting Cadderlys invitation to them to represent him and his wife Danica and al I the cathedral in the formal coronation of King Bruenor Battlehammer of Mithral Hall Ivan and Pikel had been muttering about going to see Mithral Hall for years ever since Drizzt DoUrden and Cattibrie had come through the Spirit Soaring on the road to find a lost friend With things settled comfortably along the Snowflake Mountains and with the great event of Bruenors forthcoming coronation the time seemed perfect Just out of the Snowflake Mountains their road barely begun Pikel who was a druid in his heart and in practice had informed his brother that he could guide them more swiftly on their long journey He could talk to animals after all though he hardly seemed able to talk to anyone else except for Ivan who understood his every grunt He could predict the weather with a high degree of accuracy and there was one more little trick up Pikels wide sleeve a mode of teleportation that druids understood using the connectedness of trees to step into one and emerge through another many miles away Ivan and Pikel had done just that once thus far and with more than a little complaining from Ivan who thought the whole trip perfectly unnatural They had come out into a deep dark forest At first Ivan had figured that they had entered Shilmista the elf woodland across the Snowflakes from Carradoon but after a day of wandering in the dark place both he and Pikel had come to realize that the tone of this particular forest was very different from the magical land ruled by Elbereth and his dancing kin This forest wherever it was and whatever it was was darker and more foreboding than that airy forest of Shilmista The wind held a deeper bite as if they had gone further north Ye gonna let me down Ivan called from his perch beneath the entrapping tree Uhuh Ivan gave a little chuckle held his free hand out under the trapped arm and dropped the handheld crossbow to his own waiting grasp He moved fast bringing the weapon up to his face hooking the bowstring under his top teeth and pushing it straight up until it clicked in the readied position then he bit the weapons handgrip holding it in his mouth while he reached down to pull a small dart from his bandoleer Oooof Pikel howled when he noticed He lifted a small log from beside the fire and uttered a quick chant proclaiming it a Shalala and charged for his brother Ivan calmly and deliberately set the quarrel in place on the crossbow then took up the weapon pointing it at the entangling branch Realizing that the howling Pikel was too close though the yellowbearded dwarf matteroffactly lowered the weapon the charging Pikels way and fired The quarrel hit Pikels raised enchanted club squarely the quarrel sticking home then collapsing on itself A blinding concussive flash halted Pikels charge and left the stunned dwarf standing there his beard and hair smoking on the right side his right arm still upraised but holding only a blackened stump instead of an enchanted cudgel Oooo the druid dwarf moaned Yeah and yer tree is next Ivan promised and he put the crossbow back in his mouth his hand going for another dart Pikel hit him with a flying tackle that became more of a flying tackle when the hugging dwarves flew backward only to be pulled forward by the strong branch and of course to rebound backward again And so they went bouncing back and forth Pikel grabbing at the crossbow and at Ivans pumping arm and Ivan punching Pikel though they were too tightly embraced for him to do any real damage All the while the stubborn branch held strong and the two struggling dwarves only seemed to gain momentum on their back and forth and allaround ride They were nearing the highest point of one such bounce when Pikels enchantment let go sending a ball of Bouldershoulder soaring into the air to land with a communal oof and go rolling away They rolled past the fire very close and Ivan yelped when he burned the tip of his nose They crashed through the leanto Pikel had constructed sending twigs flying At one point Pikel managed to wriggle away enough to begin casting another enchantment so Ivan slapped his strong hand over his brothers mouth Pikel promptly bit him It would have gone on for many minutesit usually did when the Bouldershoulder brothers were involved but a low growl from the fire pit stopped both dwarves dead in their roll each with a fist heading in strong for the others face As one the prone brothers turned their heads to see a large black bear pawing at the hot vegetable stew Ivan shoved Pikel away and leaped to his feet Praise Moradin he yelled as he looked around for his mighty axe Got me a new cloak Pikels shriek rent the night air and silenced every night bird for a hundred yards around Shut yer trap Ivan ordered He rushed out to the side spying his weapon and heard his brother chanting again as he started past Ivan expected to get his with another relatively harmless but ultimately annoying trick of nature When the excited Ivan had his axe in hand he turned back to the fire to see Pikel sitting in front of the contented bear resting comfortably against its thick fur Ye didnt Ivan moaned Hee hee hee With a growl Ivan lifted his arm and sent his axe twirling down to stick into the sod Damned Cadderly he bitched for in Ivans eyes Cadderly had created a monster in Pikel It was Cadderly who had first made a pet of a wild animal a white squirrel he had named Percival of all things Taking that cue Pikel had become rather famous for the friends he had made infamous to Ivan who thought the whole thing quite embarrassing at the Spirit Soaring cathedral particularly among Cadderly and Danicas children To date those friends included a great eagle a pair of baldheaded vultures a weasel family three chickens and a stubborn donkey named Bobo And now a bear Ivan sighed The bear gave a soft moan and seemed to fall over settling comfortably on the ground where it started snoring almost immediately So did Pikel Ivan sighed more deeply I do not demand applause no the gnome Nanfoodle explained his little arms crossed over his thin chest one large foot tapping anxiously on the floor but it would be appreciated yes Standing at no more than three and a half feet with a long pointy crooked nose his head bald but for a semicircular mane of wild white hair that stuck straight out above his ears and all the way back around Nanfoodle was not an imposing figure He was however one of the most celebrated alchemists in the North a fact that Elastul and Shoudra Stargleam knew well The Marchion of Mirabar began clapping his smile wide and sincere for Nanfoodle has just brought him a piece of specially treated metal smelted and fashioned of ore taken from the mines just a tenday before Coated with the new formula the ingenious gnome had concocted this plate was stronger than the others made of the same batch To the side the Sceptrana was too busy continuing her inspection of the various pieces to join in the applause but she did offer an appreciative nod to the gnome which Nanfoodle gladly accepted The two were great friends and had been since before Elastul had hired Nanfoodle and brought him to Mirabar mostly on the recommendation of Shoudra And with your new treatment for the metals our pieces will prove the best in the North Elastul said Well The gnome hesitated They will be better than they were but But There can be no buts my dear Nanfoodle Sceptrana Shoudra has contracts to secure and it will take the finestnot merely better but the finest to reclaim much of the commerce lost in recent years The ore from our rivals is richer and their techniques impeccable Nanfoodle explained My treatment will increase the strength and durability of our products by a fair amount but I doubt that well outshine the ore of Mithral Hall Elastul seemed to collapse in his seat his hands clenched at his side But we have improved Nanfoodle said with great enthusiasm hoping the emotion would prove infectious It didnt I do believe that this is the first time any measurable improvement through alchemical treatments has ever been honestly noted Shoudra Stargleam added and she quietly tossed a wink Nanfoodles way Despite the outlandish claims of many alchemists there have been few nay not few but no improvements that are not magical in nature And any improvement will help Shoudra went on There arc many previous clients who are on the borderline of decisions between Mirabar and Mithral Hall and if we can improve our quality without raising our prices then I believe I may sway more than a few our way Elastul did begin to brighten at that even started to nod but Nanfoodle chimed in Well Well the marchion asked suspiciously The adamantine flakes needed in the treating solution do not come cheap the gnome admitted Elastul dropped his head into his hands Behind him the four Hammers muttered a few select curses You are using adamantine Shoudra asked I thought you were experimenting with lead I was the gnome answered And all of the blending formula was developed with lead as the additive base He gave a shrug But that only weakened the end product unfortunately Wait Elastul bade him with biting and obvious sarcasm The marchion came up straight in his chair his finger pointing as if he had suddenly caught on to the big picture You have found a way to blend the metals And in doing so if you use a stronger metal you get a better product but if you use a cheaper one well then you get a weaker product Yes Marchion Nanfoodle admitted lowering his huge head against the biting sarcasm Ever heard of alloys dear Nanfoodle Yes Marchion Because I think you just reinvented them all over again Yes Marchion How much am I paying you Enough Shoudra Stargleam cut in moving near to the marchion and dropping her hand on his forearm to calm him This may be the first step to a great benefit If Nanfoodles technique eases the expensive process then it is not without benefit In any case this seems the first step on a potentially profitable road A good start I would say Her exuberance did make the gnome stand a bit straighter but Marchion Elastul merely offered a sarcastic smirk in response Well by all means good Nanfoodle he said Do not waste my time and coin in easing me along the whole of the process Back to work for you and not to return until we are much farther along The gnome gave a curt bow and scampered out of the room When he was gone Marchion Elastul gave a great frustrated roar Alchemy is the science of boast Shoudra said It was advice she had offered many times in the past Elastul was spending huge sums on his team of alchemists and in truth this was the greatest advance they had heard of thus far This will not do he said somberly as if his anger had been thrown out in that previous roar King Bruenor walks into our city and sets it all into confusion They are beating us with their ore and with their demeanor This will not do Our markets remain strong for all the items that do not need the fine and expensive Mithral Hall ore Shoudra reminded Those items the hoes and plows the hinges and wheel strips outnumber the swords and breastplates by far Mithral Hall has cut down one portion of our business alone The one portion that defines a mining city True enough Shoudra had to agree but she merely shrugged She had never been overly excited about the return of the neighboring dwarven stronghold and had always figured that Clan Battlehammer were better neighbors than the previous inhabitants of the place the evil grey dwarves Their momentum mounts Elastul said and he seemed to be talking more to himself than to Shoudra King Bruenor the legend returns to them now King Gandalug Battlehammer was fairly well known himself Shoudra sarcastically replied Returning from the ages lost and all Elastul shook his head with every word Not like Bruenor who wrested back control of the hall in our time With his strange friends and hearty clan Bruenor reshaped the northland and his return is significant I fear With Bruenor back on the throne you will find an even harder time in securing the contracts we need to prosper Not so It is not a chance I wish to take Elastul snapped Witness what his reputation alone did to shake our own city A simple pass through and half the dwarves are muttering his praises No this cannot stand He sat back and put a finger to his pursed lips Behind them a smile gradually widened as if some devious plan was formulating Shoudra looked at him curiously and said You cannot be thinking There are ways to see that Mithral Halls reputation drops a few notches Ways an incredulous Shoudra asked We have dwarves here who have befriended King Bruenor yes We have dwarves among us who now cal I the King of Mithral Hall their friend and he returns the compliment Torgar will commit no sabotage against Mithral Hall Shoudra reasoned seeing easily enough where this was leading He will if he doesnt know hes doing it Elastul said mysteriously and for the first time since Nanfoodle had arrived with the initial misguided news the marchions smile was wide and genuine Shoudra Stargleam just looked at the man doubtfully She had often heard his devious plotting for he spent a great portion of his time on his throne doing just that Almost always though it was just his wishful thinking at work Despite his bluster and even more than that the bluster of the four Hammers who always stood behind him Elastul wasnt really a man of action He wanted to protect what he had and even try to improve it in a safe and secure manner such as hiring alchemists but to go an extra step to actually attempt sabotage against Mithral Hall for example and thus risk starting a war simply was not the mans style It was entertaining to watch though Shoudra had to admit BECAUSE THATS HOW WE DO IT For Tred McKnuckles the sight was as painful as anything he had ever witnessed By his estimation the people of Clicking Heels had treated him and Nikwillig with generosity and tender care had jeopardized their own safety by getting into a conflict that had not even involved them Nikwillig and he had done that to them by approaching their town and they had reacted with more kindness and openness than a pair of lost dwarves from a distant citadel could have expected And now they had paid the price Tred walked about the ruins of the small village the blasted and burned houses and the bodies He chased away the carrion birds from one corpse then closed his eyes against the pain recognizing the woman as one of the caring faces he had seen when he had first opened his eyes after resting against the weariness of the difficult road that had brought him there Bruenor Battlehammer watched the dwarfs somber movements noting always the look on Treds face Before there had been a desire for vengeancethe dwarves caravan had been hit and destroyed and Tred had lost friends and a brother Dwarves could accept such tragedies as an inevitability of their existence They usually lived on the borderlands of the wilderness and almost always faced danger of one sort or another but the look on Treds tough old face was somewhat different more subdued and in a way more pained A good measure of guilt had been thrown into the tumultuous mix Tred and Nikwillig had stumbled into Clicking Heels on their desperate road and as a result the town was gone Simply brutally gone That frustration and guilt showed clearly as Tred made his way about the smoldering ruins especially whenever he came upon one of the many orc corpses always giving it a good kick in the face How manyre ye thinking Bruenor asked Drizzt when the drow returned from the outlying countryside checking tracks and trying to get a clearer picture of what had occurred at the ruins of Clicking Heels A handful of giants the drow explained He pointed up to a ridge in the distance Three to five I would make it based on the tracks and the remaining cairns of stones Cairns They had prepared well for the attack Drizzt reasoned I would guess that the giants rained boulders on the village in the dark of night softening up the defenses It went on for a long time hours at least Howre ye knowing that There are places where the walls were hastily repairedbefore being knocked down once more the drow explained He pointed to a remote corner of the village Over there a woman was crushed under a boulder yet the townsfolk had the time to remove the stone and drag her away In desperation as the bombardment continued a group even left the village and tried to sneak up on the giants position He pointed up toward the ridgeline to a boulder tumble off to the side of where he had found the giant tracks and the cairns They never got close with a host of orcs laying in wait How many Bruenor asked him Ye say a handful o giants but how many orcs came against the village Drizzt looked around at the wreckage at the bodies human and orc A hundred he guessed Maybe less maybe more but somewhere around that number They left only a dozen dead on the field and that tells me that the villagers were completely overwhelmed Giantthrown boulders killed many and methodically tore away the defensive positions A third of the villages fighting force were slaughtered out by the ridge and that left but a score of strong hearty frontiersmen here to defend T dont think the giants even came into the town to join in the fight His lips grew very tight his voice very grave I dont think they had to We gotta pay em back ye know Drizzt nodded A hunnerd ye say Bruenor went on looking around Were outnumbered four to one When the dwarf looked back at the drow he saw Drizzt standing easily hands on his belted scimitars a look both grim and eager stamped upon his facethat same look that inspired both a bit of fear and the thrill of adventure in Bruenor and all the others who knew the drow Four to one Drizzt asked You should send half our force back to Pwent and Mithral Hall just to make it interesting A crooked smile creased Bruenors weathered old face Just what I was thinking Yere the king damn ye Aint ye knowin what that means Dagnabbits less than enthusiastic reaction to Bruenors announcement that they would hunt down the orcs and giants to avenge the destruction of the town and the attack on Treds caravan came as no surprise to the dwarf king Dagnabbit was seeing things through the lens offered by his position as Bruenors appointed protectorand Bruenor did have to admit that at times he needed protecting from his own judgment But this was not one of those limes as far as he was concerned His kingdom was but a few days of easy marching from Clicking Heels and it was his responsibility and his pleasure to aid in cleansing the region of foul creature like orcs and renegade giants One thing it means is that I cant be lettin the damned orcs come down and kill the folks about me kingdom Ores and giants Dagnabbit reminded A small army We didnt come out here to We come out here to kill them that killed Treds companions Bruenor interrupted Seems likely its the same band to me To the side Tred nodded his agreement And a bigger band than we thinked the stubborn Dagnabbit argued Tred was saying that there were a score and a couple of giants but twas more n that that leveled this town Ye let me go back and get Pwent and his boys and a hunnerd more o me best fighters and well go and get the durned orcs and giants Bruenor looked over at Drizzt Trailll be cold by then he pleaded more than asked Drizzt nodded and said And well find little advantage in the way of surprise with an army of dwarves marching across the hills An army thatll kill yer orcs and giants just fine said Dagnabbit But on a battlefield of their choosing Drizzt countered He looked to Bruenor though it was obvious that Bruenor needed little convincing You get an army and we can perhaps find a new trail to lead to our enemies Yes we will defeat them but they will see us coming Our charge will be through a rain of giant boulders and against fortified positions behind rock walls or worse up on the cliff ledges barely accessible and easily defended If we go after them now and hunt them down quickly and with surprise then we will choose and prepare the battlefield There will be no flying boulders and no defended ledges unless we are the ones defending them Sounds like yere looking to have a bit o fun Cattibrie snidely remarked and Drizzts smile showed that he couldnt honestly deny that Dagnabbit started to argue as was in truth his place in all of this but Bruenor had heard enough The king held up his hand silencing his commander Go find the trail elf he ordered Drizzt Our friend Treds looking to spill a bit o orc blood Dwarf to dwarf Im owing him that Treds expression showed his appreciation at the favorable end to the debate Even Dagnabbit seemed to accept the verdict and he said no more Drizzt turned to Cattibrie Shall we I was thinkin yed never ask Ye bringing yer cat Soon enough Drizzt promised Regis and I will run liaison between you and Bruenor Wulfgar added Drizzt nodded and the harmony of the group with everyone understanding so well their place in the hunt heightened Bruenors confidence in his decision In truth Bruenor needed that boost Deep within him came the nagging worry that he was doing this out of his own selfish needs that he might be leading his friends and followers into a desperate situation all because he feared even loathed the statesmanlike life that awaited him at the end of his road But looking at his skilled and seasoned friends beginning their eager preparations Bruenor shrugged many of those doubts aside When they were done with this bit of business when all the orcs and giants were dead or chased back into their deep holes hed go and take his place at Mithral Hall and hed use this impending victory as a reminder of who he was and who he wanted to be There would be the trappings of bureaucratic process the seemingly endless line of dignitary visitors who had to be entertained to be sure but there would also be adventure Bruenor promised himself that much thinking again of the secrets of Gauntlgrym There would be time for the open road and the wind on his wild red beard He smiled as he silently made that promise He had no idea that getting what you wished for might be the worst thing of all Its all rocks and will be a difficult track even with so many of them Drizzt noted when he and Cattibrie entered the rocky slopes north of the destroyed village Or perhaps not the woman replied motioning for Drizzt to join her As he came beside her she pointed down at a dark gray stone at a patch of red marking its smooth surface Drizzt went down to one knee removed a leather glove and dipped his finger then brought it up before his smiling face They have wounded And theyre letting them live Cattibrie remarked Civilized group of orcs it seems To our advantage Drizzt remarked He ended short and turned to see a large form coming around the bend The dwarves are readied for the road Wulfgar announced And weve found them a road to walk Cattibrie explained pointing down to the stone Ore blood or a prisoners Wulfgar asked The question took the smiles from Drizzt and Cattibrie for neither of them had even thought of that unpleasant possibility Ore I would guess said Drizzt I saw no signs of mercy at the village but let us move and quickly in case it is the other Wulfgar nodded and headed away signaling to Regis who relayed the sign to Bruenor Dagnabbit and the others He seems at ease Cattibrie remarked to Drizzt when Wulfgar had left them the barbarian fading back to his position ahead of the dwarf contingent His new family pleases him Drizzt replied Enough so that he has forgiven himself his foolishness He started ahead but Cattibrie caught him by the arm and when he turned to face her he saw her wearing a serious look His new family pleases him enough that it does not pain him to see us together out here hunting side by side Then we can only hope to one day share Wulfgars fate Drizzt replied with a wry grin One day soon He started off then bounding across the uneven rock surfaces with such ease and grace that Cattibrie didnt even try to pace him She knew the routine of their hunting Drizzt would move from vantage point to vantage point all around her while she meticulously followed the trail the drow serving as her wider eyes while her own were fixed upon the stone before her feet Dont ye be too long in calling up yer cat she called to him as he moved away and he responded with a wave of his hand They moved swiftly for several hours the blood trail easy enough to follow and by the time they found the sourcean orc lying dead along the side of the path which brought a fair bit of reliefthe continuing trail lay obvious before them There werent many paths through the mountains and the ground outside the lone trail stretching before them was nearly impossible to cross even by longlegged frost giants They signaled back through their liaisons and waited for the dwarves then set camp there If the trail does not split soon we will catch up to them within two days Drizzt promised Bruenor as they ate their evening meal The orc has been dead as long as three days but our enemies are not moving swiftly or with purpose They may even be closer than we believe may even have doubled back in the hopes of finding more prey along the lower elevations Thats why I doubled the guard elf Bruenor replied through a mouth full of food Tin not looking to have a hunnerd orcs and a handful of giants find me in me sleep Which was precisely how Drizzt hoped to find the hundred orcs and the handful of giants They hustled along the next day Drizzt and Cattibrie spying many signs of the recent passing like the multitude of footprints along one low muddy dell In addition to showing the way the continuing indications led credence to Drizzts estimate of the size of the enemy force The drow and Cattibrie knew that they were gaining and fast and that the orcs and giants were making no effort to conceal themselves or watch their backs for any apparent pursuit And why should they Clicking Heels like all the other villages in the Savage Frontier was a secluded place a place where under normal circumstances the complete disaster and destruction of the village might not be known by the other inhabitants of the region for tendays or months even in the summertime when travel was easier This was not a region of high commerce except in the markets of places like Mithral Hall and not a region where many journeyed along the rugged trails Clicking Heels was not on the main road of commerce It existed on the fringes like a dozen or more similar communities comprised mostly of huntsmen that rarely if ever even showed up on any map These were the wilds lands untamed The orcs and giants knew all of this of course as Drizzt and Cattibrie understood and so the couple didnt think it likely that their enemies would have sentries protecting their retreat from a village crushed with no survivors When the couple joined the dwarves for dinner that second evening it was with complete confidence that Drizzt reasserted his prediction to Bruenor Tell your fellows to sleep well he explained Before the setting of tomorrows sun we will have first sight of our enemies Then afore the rising o the sun the next day after that our enemiesll be dead Bruenor promised As he spoke he looked over at the dwarf he had invited to dine with him that night Tred replied with a grim and appreciative nod then dug into his lamb shank with relish The terrain was rocky and broken with collections of trees evergreens mostly set in small protected dells against the backdrop of the increasingly towering mountains The wind swept down and circled about rebounding off the many mountainous faces The winding paths of swiftrunning streams cascaded down the slopes silver lines against a background of gray and blue For the inexperienced the mountain trails would be quietly deceiving leading a traveler around in up and down circles that ultimately got him nowhere near where he intended to be or taking him on a wideranging path that ended abruptly at a fivehundred foot drop Even for Drizzt and his friends so attuned with the ways of the wild the mountains presented a huge challenge They could pursue the orc force readily enough for the correct trail was clearly marked to the trained eyes of the drow but finding a way to flank that fleeing force as the trail grew fresher would not be so easy On one plateau of a particularly wide mountain fed by many trails and serving as a sort of hub for them all Drizzt found a telltale marker He bent over a patch of mud its edge depressed by the step of a recent boot The print is fresh he explained to Cattibrie Regis and Wulfgar He rose up from his crouch rubbing his muddied fingers together Less than an hour The friends glanced around focusing mostly on the higher ridgeline that loomed to the north Cattibrie was first to catch sight of the movement up there a hulking giant form gliding around a line of broken boulders Time for Guenhwyvar Wulfgar remarked Drizzt nodded and pulled the statue from his belt pouch then placed it on the ground and summoned the magical panther to his side We should pass word to Bruenor as well the barbarian added Ye do it Cattibrie replied speaking to Wulfgar Ye can get there quicker than the little one with yer longer legs Wulfgar nodded it made sense Well better locate and assess the enemy while you fetch the dwarves Drizzt explained He glanced off at Regis who was already movingto the west and not the north Flanking I go this way you go north and she goes east Regis explained His three friends smiled glad to see a bit of the old Regis returned for the giant they had spotted had been moving west to east and by going west Regis was almost assuring that his two hunting friends would find the orc and giant band before he did Guenhwyvar comes with me to the north in a direct line toward the enemy Drizzt explained She alone can run without inviting suspicion We four will meet back here right before the sunset With final nods and determined looks they split apart each moving swiftly along the appointed trail It was a strange feeling for Regis being out alone in the wilderness without Drizzt or any of the others protectively at his side Back in TenTowns the halfling had often ventured out of Lonelywood by himself but almost always along familiar trails particularly the one that would take him to the banks of the great lake Maer Dualdon and his favorite fishing hole Being alone in the wilds with known dangerous enemies not too far away felt strangely refreshing Despite his very real fears Regis could not deny the surge of energy coursing through his diminutive body The rush of excitement the thrill of knowing that a goblin might be hiding behind any rock or that a giant might even then be taking deadly aim at him with one of its huge boulder missiles In truth this wasnt an experience that Regis planned to make the norm of his existence but he understood that it was a necessary risk one leading to the greater good and one that he had to accept Still he wished he hadnt been the first to encounter the orcs a group of a dozen stragglers lagging behind their main lines Caught up in his own thoughts the distracted halfling almost walked right into their midst before ever realizing that they were there Drizzt didnt like what he was seeing High up on a rocky ledge the drow lay flat on his belly peering over an encampment of several scores of orcswhat he had expected Just beyond the camp though loomed a quartet of behemoths huge frost giants and not the dirty rogues one might expect to find consorting with orcs These were handsome creatures clean and richly dressed adorned with ornamental bracelets and rings and fine furs that were neither particularly new nor particularly weatherbeaten The giants were part of a larger more organized clanobviously a part of the network the Jarl Grayhand a name not unknown to Drizzt and the dwarves of Mithral Hall had formed in this part of the Spine of the World If the old Grayhand was loaning some of his mighty warriors out to an orc clan the implications might prove darker than one flattened village and an ambush on a band of dwarves Drizzt looked all around wondering if there was a way for him to get closer to the giants to try to overhear their conversation He could only hope theyd be speaking in a language that he could comprehend The cover between him and the orc camp was not promising though nor was the climb down the almost sheer cliff facing Beyond that the sun was already hanging low in the sky and he didnt have much time if he hoped to rejoin his friends in the appointed place at the appointed hour He lingered for many more minutes watching from afar the limited interaction between the giants and orcs His attention piqued when one large and powerful orc wearing the finest garments of all the filthy band and with a huge decorated axe strapped across its back approached the giant quartet The orc didnt go in the hesitating manner of some of the others who had been either bringing food to the behemoths or simply trying to navigate past them in as unobtrusive a manner as possible This orc and Drizzt understood that it had to the leader or at least one of the leadersstrode up to the giants purposefully and without any apparent trepidation and began conversing in what seemed to be a jovial manner Engaged straining to hear whatever tidbit he might even if only a burst of laughter Drizzt was hardly aware of the approach of an orc sentry until it was too late From one high vantage point Cattibrie noted where the orcs and giants had stopped to set their camp far to the west of where she had entered the higher northern ridgeline She realized that Drizzt was likely already surveying their encampment and she could get there but her estimate told her that shed probably arrive on the spot just in time to accompany Drizzt if they found each other back to their assigned meeting spot Thus the woman spent her time running past the east end of the enemy encampment checking the ground over which the orcs and giants would likely traverse in the morningunless of course they decided to break camp early and march on through the night which would favor the orcs no doubt though probably not be to the liking of the giants With the eye of a trained tactician which she as the adopted daughter of Bruenor Battlehammer most certainly was she looked for advantageous assault points Bottlenecks in the trail high ground where dwarves could send rocks and hammers spinning down at their enemies Despite her many duties the woman was the first of the four to return to the rendezvous point Wulfgar returned soon after her with Bruenor Dagnabbit and Tred McKnuckles at his side They have encamped almost directly north of this point the woman explained How many Bruenor asked Cattibrie gave a shrug Drizzt will know I was searching the ground ahead to see where and how we might strike tomorrow Ye find any good killin spots Cattibrie answered with a wicked smile and Bruenor eagerly rubbed his hands together then looked over at Tred and offered a nudge and a wink Yell get yer payback friend the dwarf king promised As so often in the past luck alone saved Regis He skittered behind a convenient rock without notice from the group of orcs who were engaged in an argument over some loot they had pilfered probably from the sacked village They argued pushed and shouted at each other and deciding to divide the loot up privately amongst themselves they suddenly quieted Instead of continuing along the trail to join up with the larger band they plopped themselves down right there sending a couple ahead to fetch some food That afforded Regis a lovely eavesdropping position while they rambled on about all sorts of things answering many questions for the halfling and leading him to ask many many more Drizzt could not have been in a more disadvantageous situation lying face down between a rise of stone and a boulder peering over a ledge and with someone somethinglikely an orcmoving up behind him He ducked his head and shrugged the cowl of his cloak up a bit higher hoping the creature would miss him in the dim light but when the footsteps closed the drow knew that he had to take a different course He shoved up to his knees and gracefully leaped to his feet from there spinning around and drawing his scimitars moving them as quickly as possible into a defensive position trying to anticipate the attackers thrust If the creature had come straight on Drizzt would have been caught back on his heels from the outset But the orc and it was an orc hadnt charged and didnt charge It stood back hands upraised and waving frantically having dropped its weapon to the ground at its feet It said something that Drizzt didnt completely comprehend though the language was close enough to the goblin tongue which the drow did know for him to understand that there was some recognition there spoken in an almost apologetic tone It seemed as if the orc recognizing a drow elf feared that it was intruding The obvious fear didnt surprise Drizzt for the goblinkin were usually terrified of the drowas were most reasoning races but this went beyond that he sensed The orc wasnt surprised as if the appearance of a drow elf near to this force was not unexpected He wanted to question the creature further but saw a black flash to the side of the orc and knew his opportunity had passed Guenhwyvar came across hard and fast in a great leap that put the panther about chest level with the orc Guen no Drizzt cried as the cat flew past The orcs throat erupted in blood and the creature went flying down to the stone Drizzt rushed to it turning it over thinking to stem the flow of blood from its throat Then he realized that the orc had no throat left at all Frustrated that an opportunity had flitted away but grateful that Guenhwyvar had seen the danger from afar and come rushing in to rescue him Drizzt could only shake his head He hid the dead orc as well as possible in a crevice and with Guenhwyvar at his side he started back to the rendezvous having discovered more questions than answers Plenty of ground to shape to our liking Cattibrie assured them all when they had reassembled on the plateau below the enemys position Well get the fight we want None disagreed but Bruenor wore a concerned expression Too many giants he explained when all the others had focused on him Fourd make a good enough fight by themselves Im thinking we got to hit them afore the morning Trim the numbers Not an easy thing to do if were still wanting surprise tomorrow Cattibrie added They bounced a few ideas back and forth possible plans to lure out the giants and potential areas where they could hit at the brutes away from the main force There seemed no shortage of these but getting them out wouldnt be an easy task There may be a way Drizzt offered the first words he had contributed to the planning Replaying the scene with the orc the reactions of the creature toward him Drizzt wondered if his heritage might serve him well They agreed on a place and the six and Guenhwyvar minus Drizzt started away while the drow moved back toward his last position overlooking the encampment He stayed there for just a few moments his keen eyes cutting the night and discerning an approach route toward the separate giant camp and he was gone slipping away as silently as a shadow Hell bring em down from the right Bruenor said when they reached the appointed ambush area The dwarf was facing a high cliff with a rocky broken trail running left and right in front of it before him Can ye get up there Rumblebelly Regis standing at the base of the cliff was already picking his course He had discerned a few routes already to the ledge he was hoping to reach but he wanted an easier one for a companion who was not quite as nimble as he You want to get in on the kill he asked Tred McKnuckles who was standing beside him and looking more than a little overwhelmed by the frantic planning and implementation of the seasoned companions What dya think the dwarf shot back I think you should put that weapon on your back and follow me up Regis replied with a wry grin and without further ado the halfling began his climb I aint no damn spider Tred yelled back Do you want the kill or not It was the last thing Regis meant to say and the last thing he had to say for Tred grumbling and growling to make a robbed dwarf proud began his ascent following the exact course of footholds and handholds Regis had taken It took him a long time to get to the ledge and by the time he arrived Regis was already sitting comfortably with his back against the wall twentyfive feet above the ground See if you can break off a large chunk of that rock the halfling remarked nodding to the side where a fairsized boulder had lodged itself on the ledge Tred looked at the solid stone a thousand pounds of granite doubtfully Ye think ye can drop it off came a call from below from Cattibrie Regis moved forward to regard her and Tred looked on even more doubtfully Cattibrie didnt wait for an answer but moved to the side to confer with Wulfgar The barbarian rushed away returning a few moments later with a long and thick broken branch He positioned himself below the ledge then reached up as far as he could and when it was apparent that he still couldnt reach his companions with the branch he tossed it up Regis caught it and pulled it up beside him Smiling he handed it to the bewildered Tred Youll see the halfling promised To the side on another ledge at about the same height as Regis and Treds Guenhwyvar gave a low growl and poor Tred seemed more unsettled than ever Regis just grinned and moved back into position to watch the trail behind When he heard them talking in a language that was close enough to Common to be understood Drizzts hopes for his plans climbed a bit He was on the fringes of the encampment out in the shadows behind a large rock Neither the orcs nor the giants had set any guards obviously secure in their victory The giants conversation was small talk mostly giving the drow no real information That didnt concern him too much He was more interested in finding a chance to approach one of them alone to play his hunch that this group was somewhat familiar with dark elves He got his chance almost an hour later One of the giants was snoring a sound not unlike an avalanche Another the only female of the quartet lay beside him near sleep if not already so The remaining two continued their conversation though with the long lags of silence attributable to drowsiness Finally one of the pair stood up and wandered off Drizzt took a deep breathdealing with creatures as formidable as frost giants was no easy task In addition to their great size strength and fighting prowess frost giants were not blathering idiots like their hill giant and ogre cousins By all accounts they were often quite sharp of mind and not easily fooled Drizzt had to count on his heritage and the reputation that he hoped would precede him He crept in under cover of the shadows to within a few feet of the sitting behemoth You missed some treasure he whispered The giant obviously sleepy started a bit and fell back to one elbow turning his head to regard the speaker as it asked What Seeing the dark elf the giant did move more ambitiously snapping back up to a straightbacked position Donnia it asked a name that Drizzt did not recognize except to recognize that it was indeed a name a drow name An associate he replied quietly You missed a great treasure Where What At the village A huge chest of gems and jewels buried beneath one of the fallen buildings The giant looked around then leaned in more closely You offer this he asked suspiciously so obviously not convinced that the drow that any drow would walk in and give such information away I cannot carry so much Drizzt explained I cannot carry one tenth of that which lies within While I could ferry the treasure away one armload at a time I suspect there is more still buried beneath a slab I cant budge The giant looked around again its movements showing that it was more than a little interested Not far to the side one of its companions snored coughed and rolled over I will share with you fiftyfifty and with your kin if you believe we need them Drizzt said but not with the orcs A wicked smile that crossed the giants face told Drizzt that his understanding of the race relationships within the enemy band was not far from the mark Let us continue this discussion but not here Drizzt said and he began fading back into the shadows The giant looked around yet again then moved into a crouch and crept after him following eagerly into the night moving quietly along a rocky trail to a small clearing protected behind by a sheer cliff wall On a ledge on that wall some ten feet above the head of the towering giant two sets of curious eyes looked on What will Donnia Soldou think of this the giant asked Donnia need not know Drizzt replied The giants shrug told him much told him that Donnia whoever she might be was not an overriding controlling force but more likely just an associate That brought a bit of relief to the dark elf He would hate to think that the orcs and giants were acting at the behest of a drow army I will take Geletha with me the giant announced Your friend with whom you were speaking The giant nodded And we take two shares you take one That hardly seems fair You cannot move the slab You cannot find the slab Drizzt continued the banter trying hard to keep the giant unsuspicious while his friends moved into their final positions He figured he wouldnt have to keep it up for long When a bluestreaking arrow shot out from behind him zipped past and thudded hard into the giants chest the drow was not surprised The behemoth groaned but was not badly hurt Drizzt drew his scimitars and leaped around turning to face Cattibries position still playing the part of the giants ally Where did it come from he shouted Lift me that I might see Straight ahead roared the great creature It started to bend to accommodate the drow and Drizzt turned fast and ran up its treelike arm His scimitars slashed hard across the behemoths face drawing bright lines of red The giant roared and grabbed at him but the drow had already leaped away with another bluestreaking arrow sizzling in behind him slamming the giant yet again Shrugging it off the behemoth continued to move toward Drizzt until there came a sound like a log splitting Bruenor Battlehammers manynotched axe smashed the brute in the back of the knee The giant howled and lurched grabbing the wound and Cattibrie hit it again with an arrow this time in the face Ignoring the hit as much as possible the brute lifted a foot obviously intending to smash Bruenor And it was hopping as Dagnabbit rushed out and planted his warhammer right on top of the giants set foot And a cry of Tempus followed by a second warhammer this one spinning through the air changed that course Aegisfang hit the behemoth in the chest just below its neck with a force that knocked the giant back against the wall Wulfgar came in behind the hammer recalling it magically to his grasp then charged before the giant had recovered and launched a tremendous smash right into the giants kneecap How the brute howled Cattibries next arrow hit it right in the face Up on the ledge Tred with the branch lever tucked tight over one shoulder looked from the giant to Regis his expression dumbfounded He had battled giants before on many occasions but never had he seen one so battered so quickly He looked past Regis then to Guenhwyvar The great panther crouched on a ledge to the side watching the fight but more than that watching back toward the east her ears perked up Regis held his hand out toward the ledge indicating that the target behemoth was in position Tred gave a satisfied grunt and bore down on the displaced boulder setting the lever more solidly and driving on The rock tilted and tumbled and the poor giant below which was just then beginning to regain its senses and set some type of defense against the rushing onslaught of the drow the barbarian the woman and the two fiery dwarves got a thousand pounds of granite right on top of the head The crunching sound from its neck echoed off the stone as did the resounding crash as the boulder bounced away Regis gave Tred a salute for the fine shot but the relief was shortlived for only then did the halfling and the dwarf come to understand what had so piqued Guenhwyvars interest and had kept the cat out of the fight Another giant was charging down the path and yet another one a female behind that Regis looked at Tred We could find another rock he offered just a hint of fear creeping into his voice Behind them Guenhwyvar leaped onto the shoulder of the charging giant and as it pounded on down the trail Tred shrugged and did likewise using the cats distraction to get a clear shot at the giants head with his mighty axe No crack of stone against stone had ever sounded louder than the report of Treds axe cracking into the giants skull Regis winced and looked over Or we could do that the halfling remarked though the dwarf couldnt hear him With great effort Tred stubbornly hung on to the axe handle hanging off the back of the giants head He rode the behemoth down as it stumbled to its knees then down to the ground Tred rose from the dead behemoths back and swung around to join the fray against the remaining beastor tried to then got jerked back around by his axe which remained firmly embedded He heard a groan from the side and down and only then realized and he was the only one of the band to noticethat Dagnabbit had been in an unfortunate position as the giant had slumped down and was buried beneath the behemoths great weight Drizzt started the counterattack charging up the path at the furious female frost giant He saw the giant raise her arm to throw a large stone in hand and responded by calling upon his innate drow abilities summoning a globe of darkness before the creatures face The drow dived aside frantically and the hurled rock clipped the stone where he had been standing Its rebound sent it skipping fast brushing Wulfgar in the shoulder and sending him flying then just missing Cattibrie taking Taulmaril from her hands and bloodying her fingers She fell to her knees clutching her hands her face locked in a grimace of pain Drizzt came in hard at the giant The behemoth kicked across at him and the drow went into a leaping rolling somersault right over the flying foot landing gracefully and spinning about his deadly scimitars cutting two deep lines in the back of the huge calf Bruenor came in next and hard driving in against the giants other shin with his axe The giant swatted him aside with a brutal slap but the dwarf just accepted the bouncing ride along the rocks regained his footing adjusted his onehorned helmet and wagged a finger back at the behemoth Now yere makin me mad ye overfed orc The giant kicked at Drizzt again but he was too quick for that skipping aside time and time again and spinning about to cut a wicked slash whenever presented an opening Apparently realizing that it was overmatched the behemoth kicked one last time shortening the blow in an effort not to thump the drow but to just keep him at bay The giantess turned to the south and started to run along the broken ground instead of the path where her long legs would give her an advantage Or she tried to Aegisfang whipped in smashing the ankle of the giantesss trailing foot driving that foot behind the other ankle and tripping the behemoth up She fell hard to the stone her breath blasted out by the impact She tried to rise but had no chance Drizzt was there running up her back And Guenhwyvar was there leaping onto her shoulders and biting hard at the back of her neck And Cattibrie was there holding Khazidhea her devilishly sharp sword gingerly in her injured grasp And Bruenor was there with his axe with Wulfgar behind him with the mighty warhammer back in his grasp And Tred came in escorting a shaken but not too badly hurt Dagnabbit Up on the ledge behind them Regis watched and cheered He called out when he noticed that the first felled giant was moving again albeit groggily the behemoth struggling to rise Wulfgar rushed back and put Aegisfang to swift and deadly work on the creatures huge head I never seen nothing like it Tred admitted as the band made their way back toward the main force of waiting dwarves Its all about shaping the battlefield Bruenor explained And none do it better n King Bruenor Dagnabbit added None unless its him Bruenor replied nodding his chin toward Drizzt who was tending Cattibries hands as they walked She had at least one broken finger but seemed more than ready to continue There would be no rest for the band that night There was another battlefield to properly shape in preparation for an even larger fight NOT WELCOME Uh uh Pikel said stubbornly stamping his foot hard and standing before the wide oak barring Ivans way into the enchanted tree What are ye saying Ivan shot back Ye openin the door just to keep it blocked ye dopey fool Pikel pointed past his brother to the bear which was sitting and watching its expression forlorn Ye aint takin the bear Ivan bellowed and he came forward Uh uh Pikel said again waggling his finger and shifting to fully block the way Nose to nose Ivan glowered at his brother but he heard the bear growling behind him soon enough and realized this next fight wouldnt be even Ye cant be taking him the yellowbearded dwarf reasoned Ye might be breakin up his bear family and ye wouldnt want to be doing that Oooo said Pikel seeming caught off guard for just a second before his face brightened He came forward and whispered into Ivans ear How do ye know he aint got no family Ivan roared in protest and Pikel whispered some more He telled ye Ivan bellowed in disbelief The stupid bear telled ye And yere believing him Ye ever think that he might be fibbing That he might be telling ye that just to get away from his cow or his doe or his bearess or whatever theyre calling a shebear Bearess hee hee hee said Pikel and giggling he whispered some more Hes a shebear Ivan asked and he glanced back Howre ye knowin its a never mind dont ye be telling me It aint no matter anyway Hebear or shebear he she it aint goin Pikels face seemed to sink his bottom lip getting pressed forward in a most pitiful pout but Ivan held his ground He wasnt about to do this strange treewalking unsettling under the best of conditions with a wild bear beside him Nope it aint he said calmly And when were missin Bruenors coronation ye can tell Cadderly why And when the winters finding us out here and yer friends gone to sleep ye watch me skin her for some warm blankets And when Pikels low moan stopped his fiery brothers tirade for Ivan surely recognized the defeat in Pikels tone The greenbearded Bouldershoulder walked past Ivan and over to his bear He spent a long while grooming the back of the gentle animals ears scratching and pulling ticks and gently placing the insects down on the ground Of course whenever he put down a bloated one Ivan made a point of picking it up holding it high and popping it between stubby fingers A few moments later Pikels bear ambled away and though Pikel remarked that he thought the creature was quite sad Ivan frankly saw no difference The bear was going on its way and any way would have likely been good enough for the bear Pikel walked past Ivan again He took up his newest walking stick and knocked three times on the trunk then bowed low and
